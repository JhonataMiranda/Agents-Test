They typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and multiply, leading to infection. The most common bacteria causing UTIs is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which usually lives in the intestines.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of a UTI can vary, but they often include:\\n- A strong, persistent urge to urinate\\n- Burning sensation during urination\\n- Frequent urination with little urine produced\\n- Cloudy or unusual-smelling urine\\n- Blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n- Pelvic pain in women\\n- Symptoms may differ based on the location of the infection:\\n  - **Bladder infection (cystitis)** may cause mild symptoms.\\n  - **Kidney infection (pyelonephritis)** usually presents more severe symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting.\\n\\n## Causes\\nUTIs develop when bacteria enter the urinary system, often through the urethra. E. coli is the main culprit, usually coming from the intestines. Other germs, such as different bacteria, fungi, or viruses, can also cause UTIs. Factors that can increase the risk include:\\n- Sexual activity\\n- Poor hygiene\\n- Anatomical factors, such as shorter urethras in women\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors can make individuals more prone to UTIs:\\n- **Female Anatomy**: Women have shorter urethras, reducing the distance for germs to reach the bladder.\\n- **Sexual Activity**: Increased sexual activity may introduce bacteria.\\n- **Certain Birth Control Methods**: Diaphragms and spermicides can increase the risk.\\n- **Menopause**: Hormonal changes may affect urinary tract health.\\n- **Medical Conditions**: Diseases like diabetes or using urinary catheters can weaken the immune system.\\n\\n## Complications\\nUntreated UTIs can lead to serious complications, including:\\n- Recurrent infections\\n- Permanent kidney damage\\n- Increased risk of premature birth or low birth weight in pregnant women\\n- Urethral narrowing in men\\n- Sepsis, a serious and potentially life-threatening infection.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nHealthcare providers diagnose UTIs by evaluating symptoms and conducting tests, such as:\\n- **Urinalysis**: Checking urine samples for germs, signs of inflammation, and blood.\\n- **Urine Culture**: Growing urine samples in a lab to identify specific germs and their response to antibiotics.\\nIn complex cases, imaging techniques like ultrasounds or CT scans might be used to view the urinary system.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nUTIs are usually treated with antibiotics. Common medications include:\\n- Nitrofurantoin\\n- Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim\\n- Amoxicillin\\n- Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin)\\nPatients should complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent a return of the infection and resist bacteria. For frequent UTIs, doctors may recommend low-dose antibiotics as a preventive measure.\\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\nTo minimize the risk of UTIs, consider these preventive measures:\\n- **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water helps dilute urine and flush out germs.\\n- **Good Hygiene**: Wipe from front to back, use gentle cleansers, and urinate soon after sex.\\n- **Dietary Changes**: Consuming cranberry products or probiotics may support urinary tract health.\\n- **Discuss Birth Control**: Talk with healthcare providers about safer birth control options.\\n\\n## Antibiotic Resistance\\nConcerns around antibiotic resistance emphasize the need for responsible antibiotic use.

They primarily occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and proliferate, leading to infection. The most common pathogen responsible for UTIs is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which normally resides in the intestines.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of a UTI can vary widely but often include:\\n- A persistent urge to urinate\\n- Burning sensation during urination\\n- Frequent urination with minimal urine output\\n- Cloudy urine\\n- Blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n- Strong-smelling urine\\n- Pelvic pain in women\\nSymptoms can differ based on whether the infection affects the bladder (cystitis) or the kidneys (pyelonephritis), with kidney infections often presenting more severe symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting.\\n\\n## Causes\\nUTIs occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract, typically through the urethra. Most commonly, E. coli causes these infections, particularly from the gastrointestinal tract. Other bacteria, fungi, or even viruses can also lead to UTIs. Factors including sexual activity, improper hygiene, and anatomical differences (e.g., shorter urethras in women) can increase susceptibility.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nSeveral risk factors make certain individuals more prone to UTIs:\\n- **Female Anatomy**: Women have a shorter urethra, decreasing the distance for bacteria to travel to the bladder.\\n- **Sexual Activity**: Increased sexual activity can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract.\\n- **Certain Birth Control**: Diaphragms and spermicidal agents may elevate the likelihood of infections.\\n- **Menopause**: Hormonal changes can affect urinary tract health.\\n- **Medical Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or the use of urinary catheters can compromise immune defenses and increase risk. \\n\\n## Complications\\nComplications arising from untreated UTIs can be serious and include:\\n- Recurrent infections\\n- Permanent kidney damage\\n- Increased risk of premature labor or low birth weight in pregnant women\\n- Urethral narrowing in men\\n- Sepsis, a potentially life-threatening systemic infection.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nHealthcare providers diagnose UTIs by considering symptoms and conducting tests such as:\\n- **Urinalysis**: Examining urine samples for bacteria, signs of inflammation, and blood.\\n- **Urine Culture**: Culturing urine samples to identify specific pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivities.\\nAdvanced imaging like ultrasounds or CT scans may be used in complicated cases to assess the structure of the urinary tract.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nUTIs are generally treated with antibiotics. Common medications include:\\n- Nitrofurantoin\\n- Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim\\n- Amoxicillin\\n- Fluroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin)\\nPatients are advised to complete the prescribed course of antibiotics to prevent recurrence and resistance. For recurrent UTIs, continuous low-dose antibiotics as a preventive measure may be considered.\\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\nTo reduce the risk of UTIs, the following preventive measures are recommended:\\n- **Hydration**: Drinking ample water to dilute urine and help flush out bacteria.\\n- **Hygiene Practices**: Wiping from front to back, using mild products, and urinating soon after sexual activity.\\n- **Dietary Changes**: Consider cranberry products or probiotics, which may help maintain urinary tract health.\\n- **Birth Control Methods**: Discuss alternatives to actions like diaphragms that may increase UTI risk with healthcare providers.\\n\\n## Antibiotic Resistance\\nEmerging concerns around antibiotic resistance highlight the importance of appropriate antibiotic use. Over-treatment can lead to resistant strains of bacteria that complicate treatment, necessitating ongoing developments in both preventive measures and new therapeutic strategies.\\n\\n## Future Research Directions\\nThere is ongoing research into the development of vaccines and novel therapies for UTIs. Potential studies are exploring promising avenues, such as:\\n- Vaccine development targeting uropathogenic E. coli\\n- New antibiotic compounds with better efficacy and reduced resistance potential.\\n- Investigating the role of the microbiome in preventing infections.\\n\\nIn summary, while urinary tract infections are common and often easily treatable, significant health implications arise from recurrent infections and inadequate management, accentuating the necessity for effective prevention and treatment strategies within healthcare systems.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}, {\"description\": \"Using the information received, write a report, translating very technical terms into more common language.

The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine. The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper stomach area. They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine. Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate. Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra.\\nMale urinary system\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nMale urinary system\\nMale urinary system\\nThe urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra.

Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate. Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra.\\nA urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system. The urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra.\\nWomen are at greater risk of developing a UTI than are men. If an infection is limited to the bladder, it can be painful and annoying. But serious health problems can result if a UTI spreads to the kidneys.\\nHealth care providers often treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics. You can also take steps to lower the chance of getting a UTI in the first place.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine. The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper stomach area. They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine. Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate. Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra.\\nMale urinary system\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nMale urinary system\\nMale urinary system\\nThe urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

However, you may also have flu-like symptoms or pain around your affected areas. What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)? A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection of your urinary system . This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine. The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper stomach area. They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine. Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate.

If an infection is limited to the bladder, it can be painful and annoying. But serious health problems can result if a UTI spreads to the kidneys.\\nHealth care providers often treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

While fever is the most common sign of UTI in infants and toddlers, most children with fever do not have a UTI.\\nRisk factors\\nUTIs are more common in females because their urethras are shorter and closer to the rectum. This makes it easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract.\\nOther risk factors:\\nA previous UTI.\\nRecent sexual activity.\\nChanges in the bacteria that live inside the vagina or vaginal flora. For example, menopause or the use of spermicides can cause these bacterial changes.\\nPregnancy.\\nAge (older adults and young children are more likely to get UTIs).\\nStructural problems in the urinary tract, such as enlarged prostate.\\nPoor hygiene, for example, in children who are potty-training.\\nPrevention\\nUrinate after sexual activity.\\nStay well hydrated.\\nTake showers instead of baths.\\nMinimize douching, sprays or powders in the genital area.\\nTeach girls when potty training to wipe front to back.\\nWhen to seek medical care\\nIf you or your child have symptoms of a UTI or for any symptom that is severe or concerning.\\nTalk to your healthcare provider right away‎\\nIf your child is younger than 3 months old and has a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher.\\nDiagnosis\\nYour healthcare provider will determine if you have a UTI by:\\nAsking about symptoms.\\nDoing a physical exam.\\nOrdering urine tests, if needed.\\nStarting an antibiotic to treat a UTI, if needed.\\nTreatment\\nTaking antibiotics, prescribed by a healthcare provider, at home can treat most UTIs. Your healthcare provider might also recommend medicine to help lessen the pain or discomfort. Some cases may require treatment in a hospital.\\nAny time you take antibiotics, they can cause side effects.\\nSide effects can include rash, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea and yeast infections.\\nMore serious side effects can include antimicrobial-resistant infections or C. diff infection, which causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death.\\nCall your healthcare provider if you develop any side effects while taking your antibiotic.\\nHow to feel better\\nDrink plenty of water or other fluids.\\nIf your healthcare provider prescribes you antibiotics:\\nTake antibiotics exactly as your healthcare provider tells you.\\nDo not share your antibiotics with others.\\nDo not save antibiotics for later.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days.

High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host–pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.\\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most common bacterial infections, affecting 150 million people each year worldwide 1 . In 2007, in the United States alone, there were an estimated 10.5 million office visits for UTI symptoms (constituting 0.9% of all ambulatory visits) and 2–3 million emergency department visits 2 – 4 . Currently, the societal costs of these infections, including health care costs and time missed from work, are approximately US$3.5 billion per year in the United States alone. UTIs are a significant cause of morbidity in infant boys, older men and females of all ages. Serious sequelae include frequent recurrences, pyelonephritis with sepsis, renal damage in young children, pre-term birth and complications caused by frequent antimicrobial use, such as high-level antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile colitis.\\nClinically, UTIs are categorized as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated UTIs typically affect individuals who are otherwise healthy and have no structural or neurological urinary tract abnormalities 5 , 6 ; these infections are differentiated into lower UTIs (cystitis) and upper UTIs (pyelonephritis) 5 , 7 . Several risk factors are associated with cystitis, including female gender, a prior UTI, sexual activity, vaginal infection, diabetes, obesity and genetic susceptibility 3 , 7 . Complicated UTIs are defined as UTIs associated with factors that compromise the urinary tract or host defence, including urinary obstruction, urinary retention caused by neurological disease, immunosuppression, renal failure, renal transplantation, pregnancy and the presence of foreign bodies such as calculi, indwelling catheters or other drainage devices 8 , 9 . In the United States, 70–80% of complicated UTIs are attributable to indwelling catheters 10 , accounting for 1 million cases per year 4 . Catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTIs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and are collectively the most common cause of secondary bloodstream infections. Risk factors for developing a CAUTI include prolonged catheterization, female gender, older age and diabetes 11 .\\nUTIs are caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as by certain fungi ( FIG. 1 ). The most common causative agent for both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). For the agents involved in uncomplicated UTIs, UPEC is followed in prevalence by Klebsiella pneumoniae , Staphylococcus saprophyticus , Enterococcus faecalis , group B Streptococcus (GBS), Proteus mirabilis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. 3 , 6 , 12 , 13 ( FIG. 1 ). For complicated UTIs, the order of prevalence for causative agents, following UPEC as most common, is Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae , Candida spp., S. aureus , P. mirabilis , P. aeruginosa and GBS 9 , 14 – 16 ( FIG. 1 ).\\nFigure 1. Epidemiology of urinary tract infections.\\nOpen in a new tab\\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by a wide range of pathogens, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as fungi. Uncomplicated UTIs typically affect women, children and elderly patients who are otherwise healthy. Complicated UTIs are usually associated with indwelling catheters, urinary tract abnormalities, immunosuppression or exposure to antibiotics. The most common causative agent for both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). For uncomplicated UTIs, other causative agents are (in order of prevalence) Klebsiella pneumoniae , Staphylococcus saprophyticus , Enterococcus faecalis , group B Streptococcus (GBS), Proteus mirabilis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. For complicated UTIs, the other causative agents are (in order of prevalence) Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae , Candida spp., S. aureus, P. mirabilis , P. aeruginosa and GBS. Patients suffering from a symptomatic UTI are commonly treated with antibiotics; these treatments can result in long-term alteration of the normal micro-biota of the vagina and gastrointestinal tract and in the development of multidrug-resistant microorganisms 17 . The availability of niches that are no longer filled by the altered microbiota can increase the risk of colonization with multidrug-resistant uropathogens. Importantly, the ‘golden era’ of antibiotics is waning, and the need for rationally designed and alternative treatments is therefore increasing. Recent studies have used RNA sequencing to directly analyse uropathogens from the urine of women experiencing symptomatic UTIs. These studies, together with basic science and improved animal models, have been crucial in enabling us to understand the molecular details of how uropathogens adhere, colonize and adapt to the nutritionally limited bladder environment; evade immune surveillance; and persist and disseminate in the urinary tract. These studies have therefore revealed key virulence factors that can be targeted to prevent and counteract the pathogenic mechanisms that are important in UTIs 7 , 17 , 18 . In this Review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis during bladder and kidney infection, comparing and contrasting the virulence factors used by the major uropathogens UPEC, K. pneumoniae , P. mirabilis , E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa . Furthermore, we discuss current antibiotic treatments, antibiotic resistance mechanisms, new combination therapies and future therapeutic interventions that use vaccines and small molecules to target virulence factors.\\nAdherence and colonization\\nAdherence is a key event initiating each step in UTI pathogenesis. A UTI typically starts with periurethral contamination by a uropathogen residing in the gut, followed by colonization of the urethra and subsequent migration of the pathogen to the bladder, an event that requires appendages such as flagella and pili ( FIG. 2 ). In the bladder, the consequences of complex host–pathogen interactions ultimately determine whether uropathogens are successful in colonization or eliminated.\\nFigure 2. Pathogenesis of urinary tract infections.\\nOpen in a new tab\\na | Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) begin when uropathogens that reside in the gut contaminate the periurethral area (step 1) and are able to colonize the urethra. Subsequent migration to the bladder (step 2) and expression of pili and adhesins results in colonization and invasion of the superficial umbrella cells (step 3). Host inflammatory responses, including neutrophil infiltration (step 4), begin to clear extracellular bacteria. Some bacteria evade the immune system, either through host cell invasion or through morphological changes that result in resistance to neutrophils, and these bacteria undergo multiplication (step 5) and biofilm formation (step 6). These bacteria produce toxins and proteases that induce host cell damage (step 7), releasing essential nutrients that promote bacterial survival and ascension to the kidneys (step 8). Kidney colonization (step 9) results in bacterial toxin production and host tissue damage (step 10). If left untreated, UTIs can ultimately progress to bacteraemia if the pathogen crosses the tubular epithelial barrier in the kidneys (step 11). b | Uropathogens that cause complicated UTIs follow the same initial steps as those described for uncomplicated infections, including periurethral colonization (step 1), progression to the urethra and migration to the bladder (step 2). However, in order for the pathogens to cause infection, the bladder must be compromised. The most common cause of a compromised bladder is catheterization. Owing to the robust immune response induced by catheterization (step 3), fibrinogen accumulates on the catheter, providing an ideal environment for the attachment of uropathogens that express fibrinogen-binding proteins. Infection induces neutrophil infiltration (step 4), but after their initial attachment to the fibrinogen-coated catheters, the bacteria multiply (step 5), form biofilms (step 6), promote epithelial damage (step 7) and can seed infection of the kidneys (steps 8 and 9), where toxin production induces tissue damage (step 10). If left untreated, uropathogens that cause complicated UTIs can also progress to bacteraemia by crossing the tubular epithelial cell barrier (step 11). Multiple bacterial adhesins recognize receptors on the bladder epithelium (also known as the uroepithelium) and mediate colonization ( TABLE 1 ). Uropathogens such as UPEC survive by invading the bladder epithelium, producing toxins and proteases to release nutrients from the host cells, and synthesizing siderophores to obtain iron ( FIG. 2 ; TABLE 1 ). By multiplying and overcoming host immune surveillance, the uropathogens can subsequently ascend to the kidneys, again attaching via adhesins or pili to colonize the renal epithelium and then producing tissue-damaging toxins ( FIG. 2 ; TABLE 1 ). Consequently, the uropathogens are able to cross the tubular epithelial barrier to access the blood stream, initiating bacteraemia.\\nTable 1.\\nVirulence factors used by the main uropathogens\\nUropathogen\\nVirulence factors\\nRefs\\nAdherence\\nToxin\\nImmune evasion\\nIron acquisition\\nOther\\nUPEC\\nF1C pili\\nP pili\\nS pili\\nType 1 pili\\nDr adhesins\\nHlyA\\nCNF1\\nHlyA\\nCapsular antigens\\nCNF1\\nYersiniabactin\\nAerobactin\\nEnterobactin\\nSalmochelin\\nYersiniabactin\\nAntigen43\\nFlagella\\n6 , 33 , 63 , 93 , 96 , 141 , 142\\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\\nType 1 pili\\nType 3 pili\\nND\\nCapsule\\nAerobactin\\nEnterobactin\\nND\\n49 – 51 , 143 , 144\\nProteus mirabilis\\nMR/P pili\\nNAFs\\nPMFs\\nAipA adhesin\\nTaaP adhesin\\nHaemolysins (HpmA and HlyA)\\nPta\\nCapsule\\nZapA\\nProteobactin\\nYersiniabactin-related\\nFlagella\\nUrease\\n6 , 53 , 97 , 145\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\\nExtracellular DNA\\nExopolysaccharides (alginate, PEL and PSL)\\nND\\nCapsule\\nElastase\\nExoS\\nPhospholipase\\nRhamnolipids\\nPyochelin\\nPyoverdin\\nQuorum sensing\\n81 , 86 , 137 , 146 , 147\\nStaphylococcus saprophyticus\\nAas adhesin\\nSdrI adhesin\\nUaf adhesin\\nAas\\nND\\nND\\nUrease\\n84 , 148 , 149\\nEnterococcus faecalis\\nEbp pili\\nAce adhesin\\nEsp adhesin\\nND\\nEpa\\nND\\nSortase A\\nSigV\\nMsrA and MsrB\\n54 , 55 , 61\\nEnterococcus faecium\\nEbp pili\\nEsp adhesin\\nND\\nND\\nND\\nND\\n54\\nOpen in a new tab\\nAipA, adhesion and invasion mediated by the Proteus autotransporter; CNF1, cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1; Ebp, endocarditis- and biofilm-associated; Epa, enterococcal polysaccharide antigen; Esp, enterococcal surface protein; ExoS, exoenzyme S; F1C pili, type 1-like immunological group C pili; HlyA, α-haemolysin; HpmA, haemolysin; MR/P, mannose-resistant Proteus -like; Msr, methionine sulfoxide reductase; NAF, non-agglutinating fimbria; ND, not determined; PMF, P. mirabilis -like fimbria; P pili, pyelonephritis-associated pili; Pta, Proteus toxic agglutinin; TaaP, trimeric autoagglutinin autotransporter of Proteus ; UPEC, uropathogenic Escherichia coli . The uropathogens that cause uncomplicated UTIs, including UPEC, K. pneumoniae and S. saprophyticus , have the ability to bind directly to the bladder epithelium, which is composed of the umbrella cells (also known as superficial facet cells), intermediate cells and basal cells 19 ( TABLE 1 ). UPEC and K. pneumoniae bind to uroplakins, which are the major protein components of the umbrella cell apical membrane 19 and which form a crystalline array protecting the mammalian bladder tissue from damaging agents in urine 20 . In addition to uroplakins, α 3 β 1 integrins, which are expressed at the surface of uroepithelial cells, can also serve as receptors for UPEC 21 . By contrast, complicated UTIs are initiated when the bacteria bind to a urinary catheter, a kidney stone or a bladder stone, or when they are retained in the urinary tract by a physical obstruction. Some pathogens (for example, UPEC) can cause both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. However, others such as P. mirabilis , P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp. predominantly cause complicated UTIs ( FIG. 2 ). Subsequently, these uropathogens often form biofilms that are responsible for colonization and persistence 22 , 23 ( BOX 1 ).\\nBox 1. Biofilms and morphological plasticity.\\nUropathogens use different mechanisms for survival in response to stresses in the bladder such as starvation and immune responses. By forming biofilms and undergoing morphological changes, uropathogens can persist and cause recurrent infections 40 , 129 , 130 .\\nBiofilm formation\\nExtracellular DNA (eDNA), exopolysaccharides called extracellular polymeric substances, pili, flagella and other adhesive fibres create a scaffold to form a multicellular bacterial community that is protected from immune responses, antimicrobial agents and other stresses 40 . The antimicrobial recalcitrance of uropathogens increases on biofilm maturation, as the biofilm provides a physical barrier to antibiotic entry. Therefore, understanding species-specific biofilm formation and dispersal mechanisms is crucial for the development of novel therapies that prevent colonization, such as biofilm inhibitors, anti-adhesive molecules and molecules that induce bacterial dispersion.\\nUropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) forms biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) that protect their members from neutrophils, antibiotics and other stresses 38 ( FIG. 3 ). Type 1 pili, antigen 43 and adhesive surface fibres called curli induce biofilm formation by mediating interbacterial interactions and attachment to surfaces. Transcription of antigen 43 is regulated by oxidative stress regulator (OxyR; also known as hydrogen peroxide-inducible genes activator) 131 , whereas type 1 pilus and curli fibre genes are regulated by polymyxin-resistant protein B (PrmB; also known as BasS) on iron sensing 3 , leading to phosphorylation of polymyxin-resistant protein A (PmrA; also known as BasR) and quorum sensing regulator B (QseB) 131 . UPEC biofilm formation on catheters is dependent on type 1 pili 35 .\\nProteus mirabilis produces urease, which hydrolyses urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia. This increases the urine pH and generates calcium crystals and magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitates, which are incorporated into polysaccharide capsules, forming crystalline biofilms on the catheter ( FIG. 4 ). The phosphotransferase regulator of swarming behaviour (RsbA) upregulates polysaccharide expression, represses swarming 23 and enhances biofilm formation. Mannose-resistant Proteus -like (MR/P) pili intimately associate with the crystal layers, promoting biofilm formation. Oxygen limitation in the biofilm activates the expression of MR/P pili by inducing the recombinase MrpI to reorient the promoter of the pilus genes. Similarly, expression of the fimbrial operon regulator MrpJ leads to decreased motility, promoting biofilm formation 53 , 132 .\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa has the ability to form biofilms on catheters and damaged bladder tissue 82 through several mechanisms, including quorum sensing autoinducers that bind to the transcriptional regulators LasR (which regulates elastase (LasB) expression) and RhlR (which regulates the synthesis of rhamnolipids). Quorum sensing induces the production of eDNA, rhamnolipids, lectins, elastases and toxins. The amphiphilic rhamnolipids allow microcolony formation by changing the hydrophobicity of the P. aeruginosa surface 133 . Biofilm maturation is promoted by lectin adhesins, which are important for bacterial cell–cell interactions 134 . The production of alginates and extracellular polymeric substances is activated when cyclic di-GMP binds to the transcriptional regulators alginate biosynthesis 44 (Alg44) and pellicle formation regulator D (PelD) 135 . Small RNAs from the regulator of secondary metabolites ( rsm ) family, such as rsmZ and rsmY , regulate exopolysaccharide production by reducing the availability of RsmA, which is the transcriptional repressor for exopolysaccharide-encoding genes 81 , 136 , 137 . Morphological changes\\nUropathogens also adopt morphological changes, such as filamentation, to circumvent the host immune system 130 , 138 . During IBC maturation, expression of suppressor of lon (SulA) inhibits FtsZ polymerization in a subpopulation of UPEC, blocking septation ring formation and cell division 138 . When the resulting filamentous bacterial cells emerge from epithelial cells, they are resistant to killing by neutrophils and can colonize other naive uroepithelial cells and re-enter the IBC cycle 129 , 138 ( FIG. 3 ). Alternatively, during colonization by P. mirabilis , the bacteria adopt a filamentous morphology as a result of the sensor activities of flagella on contact with a urinary catheter. Contact creates a torsional change in the outer membrane, and this is sensed by upregulator of the flagellar master operon (Umo) proteins, which induce the expression of flagella to produce the highly flagellated cells that are required for swarming during a UTI 6 , 23 , 53 , 139 ( FIG. 4 ). Chaperone–usher pathway pili\\nMany uropathogens initiate a UTI using pili that mediate adhesion to host and environmental surfaces, facilitate invasion into the host tissues and promote interbacterial interactions to form biofilms 24 – 27 . For example, numerous Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria — including E. coli , Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Haemophilus spp., Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp. 16 , 27 – 29 — express a large, highly conserved family of adhesive fibres called chaperone–usher pathway (CUP) pili 25 , 26 . CUP pili are assembled by the chaperone–usher molecular machinery 24 , 25 and are composed of pilin subunits with incomplete immunoglobulin-like folds that lack the typical carboxy-terminal seventh β-strand 30 , 31 . Briefly, in a process termed donor-strand complementation, a dedicated periplasmic chaperone ‘donates’ a β-strand to complete the immunoglobulin fold of the subunits, forming a complex with each subunit and ensuring their proper folding and stabilization. The chaperone–subunit complex is then targeted to the usher assembly protein in the outer membrane, where the usher selectively differentiates chaperone–subunit complexes and catalyses the ordered assembly of pili on the cell surface via a mechanism termed donor-strand exchange. During donor-strand exchange, the final folding of a subunit occurs as the donated β-strand of the chaperone is replaced by an amino-terminal extension on the next incoming subunit 32 . Importantly, understanding the most basic principles of molecular biology — such as how a protein folds into domains that serve as assembly modules for building large supramolecular structures, and how an outer-membrane macromolecular machine (the usher) assembles these structures from individual subunits, which are delivered as chaperone–subunit complexes and then transported in a regulated manner across a biological membrane — has led to the development of anti-virulence compounds that block CUP pilus assembly or function and that result in the dysregulation of virulence factors. These compounds have the potential for broad-spectrum activity against numerous Gram-negative bacteria (see below). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli\\nThirty-eight distinct CUP pilus operons have been identified in E. coli genomes, and a single UPEC strain can encode more than 12 different CUP pili 25 . However, the distribution of CUP operons is not uniform across different UPEC isolates; some operons are found ubiquitously in UPEC, whereas others are present in only a handful of strains. The multitude of CUP pili encoded by UPEC are tipped with different adhesins, some of which are known to mediate distinct tropisms in the lower and upper urinary tract by recognizing receptors with stereochemical specificity, notably in the bladder or kidney epithelium 33 .\\nType 1 pili and pyelonephritis-associated (P) pili are the better characterized CUP pili. Type 1 pili are essential for colonization, invasion and persistence of UPEC in the mouse bladder 34 ( FIG. 3 ). Type 1 pili are tipped with the adhesin FimH 7 , which recognizes mannosylated uroplakins and α 1 β 3 integrins with stereochemical specificity 21 , 35 to initiate colonization and invasion into umbrella cells 7 , 21 . Type 1 pili binding to these cells triggers a signal transduction cascade that activates Rho GTPases, such as those from the Rac family, to cause actin rearrangement and internalization of UPEC by a zippering mechanism consisting of a plasma membrane sheathe that engulfs the bacterium 36 ( FIG. 3 ). Invasion allows UPEC to subvert certain host defences and become recalcitrant to antibiotic treatments. However, an innate defence expulsion mechanism defends the uroepithelium from UPEC invasion; this expulsion mechanism depends on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression by uroepithelial cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated activation of TLR4 stimulates adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3) to produce cyclic AMP, which induces the exocytosis of vesicular UPEC into the apical plasma membrane of the umbrella cells 37 ( FIG. 3 ). Importantly, by escaping into the cytoplasm (through an unknown mechanism), UPEC can subvert the expulsion pathway and rapidly multiply, forming transient biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) 38 , 39 ( BOX 1 ; FIG. 3 ). After their maturation, bacteria disperse from the IBC to invade other cells, where the IBC cycle is repeated 38 – 40 . IBC formation is a common mechanism for clinical UPEC isolates and has been observed in multiple mouse backgrounds and also in exfoliated uroepithelial cells in the urine of patients with acute UTIs but not in the cells in urine from healthy controls 41 , 42 . The process of invasion and IBC formation provides UPEC with the ability to survive stringent bottlenecks in the urinary tract, including TLR4-mediated expulsion, umbrella cell exfoliation, ascension to the kidneys, urination and inflammation 7 , 43 . UPEC also establishes quiescent intracellular reservoirs (QIRs) in underlying transitional cells, within membrane-bound compartments enmeshed in F-actin ( FIG. 3 ). In contrast to the metabolically active IBCs, QIRs typically contain 4–10 non-replicating bacteria that can remain viable for months and can be re-activated to serve as seeds that initiate a recurrent UTI 7 . It has been proposed that during uroepithelial turnover, in which the underlying immature cells terminally differentiate into umbrella cells, the redistribution of actin and perhaps other associated signals might trigger UPEC revival from QIRs, releasing the bacteria back into the bladder lumen 44 .\\nFigure 3. Virulence factors of uropathogenic Escherichia coli that contribute to urinary tract infections.\\nOpen in a new tab\\na | In the bladder, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) expression of type 1 pili is essential for colonization, invasion and persistence. The type 1 pilus adhesin, FimH, binds mannosylated uroplakins and integrins that coat the surface of umbrella cells. Uroplakin binding by FimH induces actin rearrangement and bacterial internalization via unknown mechanisms. FimH–α 3 β 1 integrin interactions induce actin rearrangement via activation of RHO-family GTPases (such as RAC proteins), resulting in bacterial invasion. Inside the host cell, UPEC can subvert host defences and resist antibiotic treatment. However, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released by UPEC is sensed by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which induces cyclic AMP (cAMP) production via adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3) activation, resulting in exocytosis of vesicular UPEC across the apical plasma membrane. UPEC subverts this innate defence mechanism by escaping into the cytoplasm, where it then multiplies to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). Maturation of IBCs causes bacterial dispersal and allows the invasion of other host cells, which enables UPEC to re-enter the IBC cycle. Alternatively, UPEC can establish quiescent intracellular reservoirs (QIRs) in the underlying transitional cells. QIRs consist of 4–10 non-replicating bacteria within membrane-bound compartments encased in F-actin and can remain viable for months. In addition, UPEC survives within the harsh bladder environment by secreting several factors that are important for nutrient acquisition. The toxin α-haemolysin (HlyA) promotes host cell lysis through pore formation, facilitating iron release and nutrient acquisition. The siderophores expressed by UPEC allow the bacterium to scavenge iron and thus promote survival during a urinary tract infection (UTI). HlyA also triggers epithelial exfoliation to promote the spread of UPEC to other hosts following urine expulsion or to expose deeper layers of the uroepithelium for QIRs. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) is also important for host cell remodelling and functions by binding to the receptor basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) on host cells to induce constitutive activation of the RHO GTPases RAC1, RHOA and cell division control 42 (CDC42), resulting in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane ruffling. Activation of RAC1 also induces the host cell anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways, preventing apoptosis of colonized epithelial cells and allowing the UPEC population to expand. The extracellular survival of UPEC also requires evasion of the innate immune system by the adoption of a filamentous morphology, which renders the bacterium more resistant to neutrophil killing than their bacillary form. b | UPEC colonization of the kidneys is dependent on expression of pyelonephritis-associated (P) pili, which bind globoside-containing glycolipids lining the renal tissue. The P pilus adhesin, PapG, also interacts with TLR4, reducing the expression of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR). This results in impaired immunoglobulin A (IgA) transport across the epithelium, thereby modulating the local secretory antibody immune response and preventing UPEC opsonization and clearance. Unlike the mannose-binding adhesin FimH of type 1 pili, the adhesin of P pili, PapG, binds globosides containing glycolipids that are present in the human kidneys 33 ( FIG. 3 ). In addition, PapG modulates the local secretory-antibody immune response by interacting with TLR4 to reduce polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PlGR) expression, thus impairing immunoglobulin A transport through the lamina propria and epithelial cells to the kidney lumen 45 ( FIG. 3 ). By inhibiting immunoglobulin A transport into the urinary space, UPEC evades a key host protective mechanism, allowing the establishment of ascending infection 45 , 46 .\\nImportantly, the initial innate host response to UPEC colonization and invasion not only dictates the outcome of the original infection but is also crucial for determining host susceptibility to subsequent infections 39 . An increased susceptibility to recurrent UTIs can occur not because of a deficient host response to UPEC infection, as is commonly accepted, but rather as a result of an unrestrained lymphocyte-dependent innate inflammatory response to acute infection, leading to severe acute injury to the mucosal uroepithelium and potentiating subsequent infections 39 . Klebsiella pneumoniae\\nSimilarly to UPEC, K. pneumoniae uses type 1 pili for biofilm formation and bladder colonization 47 ( TABLE 1 ). Interestingly, although the K. pneumoniae adhesin FimH is highly homologous to UPEC FimH, they have different binding specificities 48 . K. pneumoniae FimH-mediated biofilm formation is inhibited by heptyl mannose, as opposed to the methyl mannose-mediated inhibition of UPEC FimH. Moreover, K. pneumoniae FimH has a weaker adherence to the bladder than UPEC FimH, resulting in significantly lower K. pneumoniae titers in the mouse bladder and fewer IBCs than are seen for UPEC. Despite the relatively poor adhesive properties of K. pneumoniae FimH in the urinary tract, it remains an important virulence factor for K. pneumoniae during colonization, biofilm formation and persistence in both UTIs and CAUTIs 48 – 50 . In addition , K. pneumoniae encodes numerous other CUP pili, including type 3 pili, which also play an important part in colonization, biofilm formation and persistence during UTIs and in biofilm formation during CAUTIs 35 , 51 , 52 . Proteus mirabilis\\nFollowing initial attachment, P. mirabilis produces mannose-resistant Proteus -like (MR/P) pili, which are CUP pili that facilitate biofilm formation and colonization of the bladder and kidneys, and are crucial for catheter-associated biofilm formation 6 , 16 , 23 , 53 ( BOX 1 ; FIG. 4 ). Other CUP pili encoded by P. mirabilis include P. mirabilis -like fimbriae (PMFs), which are important for bladder and kidney colonization 53 , and non-agglutinating fimbriae (NAFs), which are able to attach to uroepithelial cells in vitro 53 . However, the in vivo mechanistic roles of PMFs, NAFs and their receptors have not yet been established.\\nFigure 4. Mechanisms of pathogenesis during catheter-associated urinary tract infections.\\nOpen in a new tab\\na | Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) mediated by Proteus mirabilis depend on the expression of mannose-resistant Proteus -like (MR/P) pili for initial attachment, and for biofilm formation on the catheter and in the bladder. Subsequent urease production induces the formation of calcium crystals and magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitates in the urine through the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia, resulting in a high pH. The production of extracellular polymeric substances by bacteria attached to the catheter traps these crystals, allowing the formation of a crystalline biofilm, which protects the community from the host immune system and from antibiotics. In addition, these structures prevent proper urine drainage, resulting in reflux and promoting the progression to pyelonephritis, septicaemia and shock. Finally, production of the bacterial toxins haemolysin (HpmA) and Proteus toxic agglutinin (Pta) is important for tissue destruction and bacterial dissemination to the kidneys. HpmA induces pore formation by inserting itself into the cell membrane and destabilizing the host cell, causing tissue damage, exfoliation and nutrient release. Pta punctures the host cell membrane, causing cytosol leakage and resulting in osmotic stress and depolymerization of actin filaments, thus compromising the structural integrity of the cell. The release of nutrients via these toxins also allows the bacteria to scavenge iron using siderophores. b |\\nEnterococcus faecalis pathogenesis during CAUTIs depends on catheter implantation, which results in bladder inflammation and causes fibrinogen release, deposition onto the catheter, and accumulation. E. faecalis takes advantage of the presence of fibrinogen and uses it as a food source through the production of proteases. E. faecalis also binds fibrinogen through the endocarditis- and biofilm-associated (Ebp) pilus, allowing the formation of biofilms that protect the bacteria against the immune system. In addition to CUP pili, P. mirabilis encodes two autotransporters, TaaP (trimeric autoagglutinin autotransporter of Proteus ) and AipA (adhesion and invasion mediated by the Proteus autotransporter), which are important for bladder and kidney infection, respectively 53 . AipA can adhere to human bladder and kidney cell lines in vitro but is only required for kidney infection (and not for bladder infection) in mice. Conversely, TaaP is required for bladder infection by P. mirabilis in mice. Importantly, both autotransporters bind to extracellular-matrix proteins in vitro: AipA preferentially binds to collagen I, and TaaP to laminin, which might provide an explanation for their different tissue tropisms. Enterococci\\nEnterococci encode several adhesion factors, including the collagen adhesin Ace, enterococcal surface protein (Esp), enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (Epa), and endocarditis- and biofilm-associated (Ebp) pili 54 ( TABLE 1 ). Of these, Ebp pili contribute to CAUTIs 54 – 56 and are required for persistence during infection 55 , 56 . Clinical studies have shown that mechanical stress induced by urinary catheterization produces histological and immunological changes in the bladder, resulting in a robust inflammatory response, exfoliation, oedema, and mucosal lesions of the uroepithelium and kidneys 57 , 58 . Importantly, a mouse model of CAUTI seems to recapitulate these immunological changes that are induced by urinary catheterization, exhibiting catheter-induced inflammation, severe uroepithelial damage, exfoliation and the onset of bladder wall oedema, which is exacerbated by increased catheterization time 59 . Urinary catheters provide a surface for E. faecalis attachment and biofilm formation, which promotes E. faecalis persistence in the bladder and further dissemination to the kidneys 55 ( FIG. 4 ). However, E. faecalis is unable to bind to catheter material in vitro and is unable to grow in urine 60 . This apparent paradox was resolved by the finding that urinary catheterization induces fibrinogen release into the bladder as part of the inflammatory response; this fibrinogen subsequently accumulates in the bladder and is deposited on the implanted catheter 60 ( FIGS 2 , 4 ). Following fibrinogen deposition, the Ebp pilus adhesin — EbpA, which contains an N-terminal fibrinogen-binding domain — mediates catheter colonization and biofilm formation during CAUTIs caused by E. faecalis 60 , 61 ( FIG. 4 ). Furthermore, E. faecalis can use fibrinogen for growth, enhancing biofilm formation on the catheter 60 ( FIG. 4 ). This resolution of the paradox has been recapitulated in vitro by the demonstration that E. faecalis attaches to fibrinogen-coated catheters and grows in urine supplemented with fibrinogen 60 . Other virulence factors\\nThe bladder environment is limited in nutrients; thus, in order to survive and grow within the urinary tract, uropathogens produce proteases and toxins that damage the host tissue to release nutrients, while also providing a niche for bacterial invasion and dissemination ( TABLE 1 ).\\nProteases and toxins\\nUPEC secretes high concentrations of α-haemolysin (HlyA), which oligomerizes and integrates in the cholesterol-rich microdomains in the host cell membrane in a Ca + -dependent manner 62 , 63 . This results in pore formation in the umbrella cells and promotes their lysis, which facilitates iron and nutrient acquisition by the bacteria ( FIG. 3 ). HlyA also triggers exfoliation, exposing deeper layers of the uroepithelium for colonization and promoting bacterial spread to other hosts following cell expulsion in the urine 62 – 65 ( FIG. 3 ). Furthermore, HlyA is highly expressed in IBCs, suggesting that it is important during this stage of infection 39 , 63 , 66 .\\nUPEC also secretes cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), which affects actin remodelling in the host cell through three small RHO GTPases: RAC1, RHOA and cell division control 42 (CDC42) 67 , 68 . CNF1 enters the host cell in endocytic vesicles, by binding to the receptor basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM; also known as LU) 69 , and then constitutively activates RHO GTPases via deamination of a glutamine residue; this causes actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane ruffling, leading to increased levels of bacterial internalization 67 , 70 . In addition, the activation of RAC1–GTP induces the host cell anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways (through the interaction of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT (also known as PKB) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)); this prevents apoptosis of the colonized uroepithelium, thus facilitating UPEC survival and protecting the niche 67 , 71 ( FIG. 3 ).\\nP. mirabilis produce two toxins, haemolysin (HpmA) and Proteus toxic agglutinin (Pta), which are implicated in tissue damage and dissemination to the kidneys, initiating acute pyelonephritis 16 , 72 . HpmA is a Ca + -dependent pore-forming cytolysin that destabilizes the host cell by inserting itself into the cell membrane and causing a Na + efflux 16 ( FIG. 4 ). By contrast, the surface-associated cytotoxic protease Pta is functional only in an alkaline pH, such as that induced by the activity of P. mirabilis urease 73 . In the proposed mode of action, Pta punctures the host cell membrane, causing leakage of the cytosol, osmotic stress and depolymerization of actin filaments; the structural integrity of the cell is therefore compromised, resulting in bladder and kidney damage 53 , 73 ( FIG. 4 ). Pta also induces bacterial cell–cell interaction via autoaggregation 53 , 73 .\\nP. aeruginosa produces elastases, exoenzyme S (ExoS) and haemolytic phospholipase C, all of which have been implicated in UTI initiation and dissemination, and subsequent pyelonephritis 74 , 75 ( TABLE 1 ). The GTPase activity of ExoS downregulates macrophage RAC1 function, interfering with lamellopodium formation and inducing membrane ruffle formation. The ADP-ribosyltransfease activity of ExoS targets RHO family proteins (RAS proteins and RalA), affecting cell adherence and morphology 76 . Elastase induces tissue destruction through its protease activity, releasing nutrients (including iron) for continued bacterial growth 77 . Phospholipase C is an α-toxin that hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine from the host cell membrane, compromising cell integrity and resulting in organ damage 78 – 80 . The expression of all of these virulence factors is regulated by the quorum sensing system 81 . Quorum sensing is activated at high cell density by the accumulation of small molecules called autoinducers. When a threshold level of autoinducers is reached, they bind to transcriptional activator proteins and activate the expression of virulence factors 81 , 82 ( BOX 1 ). Urease\\nUrease is encoded by several uropathogens, including P. mirabilis 53 , 83 , S. saprophyticus 84 , K. pneumoniae 85 and P. aureginosa 86 , and is important for colonization and persistence during P. mirabilis and S. saprophyticus UTIs 83 , 84 ( FIG. 4 ; TABLE 1 ). This enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia 87 , resulting in elevated urine pH and the production of calcium crystals (apatite) and magnesium ammonium phosphate ammoprecipitates (struvite) in urine and on catheters 53 ( FIG. 4 ). Importantly, the accumulation of ammonia becomes toxic for the uroepithelial cells, inducing direct tissue damage 88 . The P. mirabilis urease, one of the best studied ureases involved in UTIs, is a Ni 2+ -dependent metalloenzyme that is essential for colonization of the bladder and kidneys and promotes the formation of stones 23 , 53 , 87 . The P. mirabilis urease is induced by urea and is constitutively expressed during growth in urine 89 . This urease is highly active, hydrolysing urea several times faster than those produced by other species, such as Providencia stuartii , Providencia rettgeri , Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii 90 . The high activity level of the P. mirabilis enzyme induces rapid crystal formation, and these crystals become trapped within the polysaccharides produced by attached bacterial cells, forming crystalline biofilms on catheters 23 , 89 , 91 . The crystalline biofilms provide P. mirabilis with protection from the host immune system and antibiotics 88 ( BOX 1 ; FIG. 4 ). These structures also block urine drainage from the ureters, potentially resulting in reflux and promoting progression to pyelonephritis, septicaemia and shock 53 . Iron scavenging\\nThe bladder environment is limited in iron. Thus, to be able to grow in human urine, uropathogens utilize siderophore systems for iron (Fe 3+ ) scavenging; these systems are composed of the siderophore assembly machinery, a siderophore responsible for binding iron and a membrane receptor that internalizes the iron bound to the siderophore 92 ( TABLE 1 ).\\nUPEC produces several siderophores 93 , of which two — aerobactin and yersiniabactin — are essential in the urinary tract 93 ( FIG. 3 ). Aerobactin is highly expressed, stable at low pH and displays higher levels of iron binding than enterobactin 94 , 95 . Yersiniabactin is important in bio-film formation in urine and has a protective role against intracellular killing by copper stress, as it sequesters host-derived copper 96 .\\nNumerous iron-scavenging siderophore systems are utilized by other uropathogens: K. pneumoniae produces enterobactin and aerobactin 85 ; P. mirabilis uses proteobactin and yersiniabactin-related 97 ; and P. aeruginosa produces pyochelin and pyoverdin 86 ( TABLE 1 ). Siderophore systems are important potential targets for vaccine development 98 and for designing small molecules that interfere with their function. Treatment of urinary tract infections\\nUTIs result in considerable economic and public health burdens and substantially affect the life quality of afflicted individuals 17 . Currently, antibiotics — such as trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and ampicillin — are the most commonly recommended therapeutics for UTIs 4 . However, increasing rates of antibiotic resistance and high recurrence rates threaten to greatly enhance the burden that these common infections place on society. Ideally, alternative therapies will be established that will be recalcitrant to the development of resistance. Many promising approaches are being developed, from leveraging what we have learned about the basic biology of UTI pathogenesis to specifically target virulence pathways. These antivirulence therapeutics should theoretically allow us to effectively neutralize, or ‘disarm’, the capacity of UTI pathogens to cause disease, without altering the gut commensal microbiota, because antivirulence therapeutics target processes that are critical for UTI pathogenesis but that are not required for the essential processes of growth and cell division (which are the targets of conventional antibiotics).\\nBelow, we discuss the current challenges that have arisen from the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains and highlight the progress that is being made towards the development of antivirulence therapeutics for UTIs. We also discuss how an understanding of the evolution of bacterial resistance mechanisms and their spread is providing new approaches for the modification and improvement of current therapeutic options.\\nMultidrug resistance\\nUTIs are becoming increasingly difficult to treat owing to the widespread emergence of an array of antibiotic resistance mechanisms 3 , 4 , 15 , 99 – 102 (see Supplementary information S1 (table) ). Of particular concern are members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli and K. pneumoniae , which have both acquired plasmids encoding extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). These plasmids rapidly spread resistance to third-generation cephalosporins as well as other antibiotics 15 , 99 – 103 ( BOX 2 ). Other Enterobacteriaceae family members produce the class C β-lactamases (AmpC enzymes) that are active against cephamycin in addition to third-generation cephalosporins, and are also resistant to β-lactamase inhibitors 99 – 102 . The expression of AmpC enzymes is also associated with carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae strains lacking a 42 kDa outer-membrane protein 15 , 99 – 102 ( BOX 2 ).\\nBox 2. Antibiotic resistance.\\nMultidrug-resistant uropathogenic organisms are becoming an expanding public health threat, as Enterobacteriaceae family members increasingly acquire extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) such as cefotaximases (CTX-Ms) and oxacillinases (OXAs), AmpC-type β-lactamases and carbapenemases.\\nESBLs\\nOriginating in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli , ESBLs are now prevalent throughout the Enterobacteriaceae family, as frequent use of cephalosporins in the nosocomial setting and the carriage of ESBL-encoding genes on transferrable elements together create an ideal environment for the selection of antibiotic resistance 99 , 102 . ESBLs are plasmid-encoded or chromosomally encoded β-lactamases with broad activity against penicillins and cephalosporins. They function by splitting the amide bond of the β-lactam ring, thus inactivating β-lactam antibiotics 102 . Troublingly, ESBLs are encoded on plasmids that typically carry other resistance genes which provide activity against aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and quinolones, making the bacteria that acquire these plasmids multidrug resistant 101 , 102 . CTX-Ms\\nThe plasmids encoding the ESBLs CTX-Ms form a new plasmid phylum that is phylogenetically distinct from other plasmid-encoded β-lactamases. CTX-Ms are active against narrow-, broad- and extended-spectrum penicillins, classical and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and monobactams 99 , 102 , 103 . Notably, they also confer high-level cefotaxime resistance 99 , 103 . CTX-Ms are the most prevalent β-lactamases in community-associated isolates and are typically encoded on plasmids with other resistance genes 102 . CTX-Ms efficiently hydrolyse the β-lactam ring via nucleophilic attack of a ring carbonyl carbon by a conserved serine in the β-lactamase, resulting in a ring-opened product that is inactive 140 . OXAs\\nOXAs are ESBLs that are typically encoded by plasmids and mediate resistance to ampicillin, cephalothin, oxacillin and cloxacillin by hydrolysing the β-lactam rings 99 , 103 . In addition, OXAs are characterized by their ability to resist the β-lactamase inhibitor clavulante 103 . To date, OXAs have been shown to be expressed only in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 99 , 103 . AmpC enzymes\\nThe chromosomally encoded AmpC enzymes hydrolyse penicillins, third-generation and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and cephamycins, and are resistant to β-lactamase inhibitors, including clavulanate 99 , 102 . AmpC expression is induced in response to β-lactams, cephamycin and cephalosporin exposure. Carbapenemases\\nCarbapenemases are ESBLs that confer the ability to inactive carbapenems in addition to penicillins and extended-spectrum cephalosporins 99 , 101 , 102 . The two most clinically relevant carbapenemases, K. pneumoniae (serine) carbapenemase (KPC) and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1), originated in K. pneumoniae and rapidly spread throughout the Enterobacteriaceae family, creating carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) 15 , 99 , 101 , 102 . The broad activity of carbapenemases confers resistance against a wide range of extended-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics, particularly carbapenem. Multidrug resistance is also common among enterococci, as they are naturally resistant to trimethoprim, clindamycin, cephalosporins and penicillins 15 , 101 , 102 . Recently, Enterococcus spp. have developed high-level resistance to glycopeptides, including vancomycin, which is considered to be one of the last lines of defence against multidrug-resistant organisms. Specifically, enterococci evolved resistance to glycopeptides through the expression of vancomycin and teicoplanin A-type resistance ( van ) genes that encode the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) VanA, VanB, VanD, VanE, VanG and VanL 101 , 102 . The mechanism of resistance for VanA, the most common PBP expressed by enterococci, is to replace the cell wall precursor D-alanine–D-alanine with D-alanine–D-lactose, effectively reducing the binding affinity of vancomycin 104 . The troubling trend towards a high prevalence of multi-drug-resistant uropathogens has spurred the development of alternative control measures and treatment options. Combination therapies\\nNew antimicrobials that are resistant to inactivation by ESBLs are under development for use in combination with new classes of β-lactamase inhibitors, which target both β-lactamases and K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) 105 – 107 . These combination therapies have been shown to be effective in vitro against carbapenem-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, clinical trials involving complicated UTIs revealed that ceftazidime, a third-generation cephalosporin that is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, is effective against ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria when combined with the β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam 105 . Future studies are needed to test the efficacy of ceftazidime–avibactam against ESBL-, KPC- and AmpC-producing Gram-negative pathogens during infection, as the drug combination has the potential to be effective against a broad range of cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae family members. Although these antibiotic–inhibitor combinations are promising, the development of resistance to β-lactamase inhibitors is not well characterized 105 . Moreover, the effectiveness of specific antibiotic–inhibitor therapies is dependent on the antimicrobial-resistance patterns encoded by each pathogen, as the expression of certain combinations of ESBLs and carbapenemases can provide resistance to an antibiotic–inhibitor therapy 105 – 107 . For example, the combination of BAL30072–BAL29880 –clavulanate (two β-lactam antibiotics and a β-lactamase inhibitor) is effective against many carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae family members, but K. pneumoniae strains that typically produce KPCs and SHVs (another type of ESBL), or AmpC enzymes are resistant 106 . Therefore, it is crucial to know which antibiotic mechanisms are available to a specific uropathogen in order to determine an effective treatment. Vaccines targeting bacterial adhesion\\nAs adherence has a key role at nearly every step of UTI pathogenesis, one attractive strategy for the development of antivirulence therapies, including vaccines, has been to target CUP pili. As a general rule, vaccination with whole pili has been ineffective at generating an antibody response that can protect against UTIs. However, adhesin-based vaccines have been shown to be effective at blocking host–pathogen interactions, thus preventing the establishment of disease 108 – 112 . Experiments using mouse and cynomolgus monkey models of UTIs determined that immunization with PapD–PapG or FimC–FimH chaperone–adhesin complexes protected against UTIs 108 – 112 . The effectiveness of the FimC–FimH vaccine was shown to be due, in large part, to antibodies that block the function of FimH in bladder colonization 110 . Furthermore, the anti-FimH antibodies did not seem to alter the E. coli niche in the gut microbiota 109 . Modifications of this vaccine are currently under development, with the aim of inducing greater immune stimulation 108 , 112 . For example, one approach has been to fuse FimH to the flagellin FliC in order to induce a more substantial acute inflammatory response, which functions through TLR4 signalling via the MYD88 pathway 112 . A Phase I clinical trial began in January 2014 to evaluate the efficacy of a FimC–FimH vaccine using a synthetic analogue of monophosphoryl lipid A as the adjuvant.\\nIn addition to the UPEC adhesins, adhesins from P. mirabilis and E. faecalis have also been used as vaccine targets 60 , 113 . In a mouse model of UTI, vaccination with the P. mirabilis MR/P pilus adhesin, MrpH, reduced bacterial burdens compared with those of unvaccinated controls, similar to the results observed with UPEC in the FimH vaccine trials 110 , 113 . Moreover, a vaccine strategy that is efficacious against E. faecalis CAUTIs is being developed based on vaccination with the Ebp pilus adhesin, EbpA. This strategy induced high antibody titers and reduced bacterial burdens in a mouse model of CAUTI 60 . In conclusion, adhesin-based vaccines represent a promising area for the development of therapeutics against uropathogens. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of host–pathogen interactions is crucial for vaccine development strategies. Vaccines targeting bacterial toxins and proteases\\nThe UPEC pore-forming toxin HlyA has also received attention as a potential vaccine target and was evaluated in a mouse model of pyelonephritis to assess protection against renal damage 114 , 115 . Vaccination with HlyA reduced the incidence of renal scaring compared with controls; however, it did not protect against UPEC colonization of the kidneys 115 . In addition, in a mouse model of UTI, vaccination with the P. mirabilis haemolysin, HpmA, did not provide protection against bacterial colonization 116 . However, vaccination with Pta, an alkaline protease with toxic effects towards epithelial cells, displayed promising results in a mouse model of UTI, protecting against upper UTI, although bacterial burdens in the bladder remained unaffected 116 . Thus, although haemolysins and proteases might provide effective vaccine targets for preventing upper UTIs, additional studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these enzymes as targets for vaccines. Vaccines targeting siderophores\\nIron acquisition systems have shown great promise as targets for vaccine development because uropathogens require a source of iron during colonization and persistence. Furthermore, siderophore and haem acquisition systems have been shown to be upregulated during experimental infection, as well as in the urine of women with a UTI 86 , 94 , 97 , 98 . These parameters sparked vaccine development based on ferric yersiniabactin uptake receptor (FyuA), haem acquisition protein (Hma), iron uptake transport aerobactin receptor (IutA) and the siderophore receptor iron-responsive element A (IreA) 98 . Vaccination with FyuA and Hma protected mice against pyelonephritis 98 , 117 , whereas vaccination with IutA and IreA reduced bladder colonization in mice, confirming the importance of these proteins during infection 98 , 117 . Interestingly, the differential tissue-specific protection seen with these four proteins suggests that these systems have different roles or expression profiles in different niches, including the bladder or kidneys.\\nVaccinations with other siderophore systems in mouse models of UTI, including the iron receptors FitA and ChuA 98 , were not protective against infection and were correlated, to a large extent, with lower antigen-specific humoral responses during experimental UTI. These studies suggest that effective siderophore-based vaccines function in part by preventing cognate siderophore uptake, as is the case with FyuA, Hma, IutA and IreA 98 , 117 , making this an exciting area of therapeutic development against UTIs. Small molecules targeting urease\\nSeveral urease inhibitors have been developed as potential drugs for UTI treatment, with varying results 89 . Many of the early inhibitors were active against ureases from several different bacterial species, including Helicobacter pylori, P. mirabilis and S. saprophyticus , and many of these inhibitors showed great promise, as they had low binding and inhibitory concentrations. The best characterized urease inhibitor, acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), even had some success in treating UTIs caused by urease-producing organisms; this inhibitor works by preventing urine alkalization and was approved by the FDA in 1983 (REF. 89 ). However, many of these inhibitors had severe side effects related to toxicity. For example, AHA resulted in teratogenicity, as well as psychoneurological and musculo-integumentary effects. Subsequent studies showed that derivatives of AHA also had considerable inhibitory properties, but again, these compounds had mutagenic properties that made them undesirable therapeutics 89 . Another group of urease inhibitors, the phosphoramidites, exhibited potent activity against P. mirabilis urease and were effective in a mouse model of infection. However, this class of compounds displayed low stability in the low pH of gastric juice, making them impractical 89 . Finally, the heterocyclic compounds termed benzimidazoles have garnered much attention because they function as proton pump inhibitors that irreversibly inactivate ATPase systems 118 . These compounds are currently the standard treatment for peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease 89 . Benzimidazoles interact with the gastric hydrogen potassium ATPase, thereby inactivating them and effectively limiting the disease 118 . Interestingly, benzimidazoles also bind to the urease metallocentre, effectively blocking the active site of the enzyme through steric hindrance 89 . Benzimidazoles also have a bactericidal activity against H. pylori , and this is not mediated by urease inhibition, indicating that these compounds have a more general bactericidal effect 89 , 119 . Great strides have been made to identify and characterize urease inhibitors, but more work is needed to bring these potential treatments to the market. Small molecules targeting bacterial adhesion\\nOur detailed understanding of pilus assembly and pilus–receptor binding has opened the door to the development of two classes of small, rationally designed synthetic compounds to inhibit pili: mannosides, which inhibit pilus function; and pilicides, which inhibit pilus assembly. Targeting CUP pilus function or assembly has therapeutic potential, as it should block UPEC colonization, invasion and biofilm formation, thus preventing disease 30 , 31 , 120 , 121 .\\nPilicides were originally developed to specifically inhibit the assembly of UPEC type 1 pili. They have a 2-pyridone scaffold 28 , 30 , 31 , 120 and function by selectively targeting and interfering with crucial chaperone–usher interactions. Further studies have been carried out to investigate their broad spectrum of activity against other CUP pili 122 . A recent analysis of 35 Escherichia spp. genomes and 132 plasmids identified a total of 458 CUP operons, representing 38 distinct CUP pilus types on the basis of usher phylogeny 25 . A single Escherichia sp. genome can have as many as 16 distinct, intact CUP oper-ons 25 , suggesting that compounds which target CUP pili by disrupting their assembly would potentially exhibit broad-spectrum activity. For example, pilicide ec240 was found to disrupt several virulence-associated pili, including type 1 pili, P pili and S pili, as well as flagellar motility 122 . The effect of ec240 on the transcriptome and proteome of the cystitis isolate E. coli UTI89 revealed that the most downregulated genes after growth in the presence of ec240 were the type 1 pilus genes. Type 1 pilus expression is controlled by inversion of the type 1 fimbriae promoter element ( fimS ), which can oscillate between phase ON and phase OFF orientations. ec240 induced the fimS phase OFF orientation and increased the expression of the transcriptional regulators S-fimbrial switch regulatory protein (SfaB) and P pilus regulatory protein PapB, which have been shown to promote a fimS phase OFF orientation 122 . Thus, the potency of pilicide ec240 is largely due to its ability to induce a phase OFF orientation of the type 1 pilus promoter, rather than any interference with chaperone–usher interactions. Additional work revealed that other pilicides also inhibit the production of Dr pili, another type of UPEC CUP pili that are known to be important in pyelonephritis in mice and humans 30 , 33 . Furthermore, pilicides have been shown to disrupt CUP pilus biogenesis in K. pneumoniae and also in Haemophilus influenzae (a finding that has important implications for otitis media) 24 , 29 . Thus, pilicides represent an exciting class of antivirulence molecules with the potential to target a broad spectrum of pathogens that utilize CUP pili in attachment and the establishment of infection. Future studies using mouse models of UTIs and CAUTIs to investigate the role of CUP pili in Gram-negative bacterial infections, as well as the efficacy and bioavailability of pilicides as therapeutics, will unravel the potential of this class of molecules.\\nMannosides, which are FimH receptor analogues, have been developed to bind FimH with high affinity and block FimH binding to mannosylated receptors 35 , 121 , 123 – 125 . Mannosides are potent FimH antagonists that offer a promising therapeutic opportunity for the treatment and prevention of UTIs by interrupting key host–pathogen interactions 123 – 125 . Studies in mouse models have demonstrated the potential of mannosides as novel therapeutic strategies against UTIs: mannosides are orally bioavailable; they are potent and fast-acting therapeutics in treating and preventing UTIs; they function by preventing bladder colonization and invasion; they are effective against multidrug-resistant UPEC; they potentiate antibiotic efficacy; and they are effective against established UTIs and CAUTIs 35 , 121 , 124 , 125 .\\nInterestingly, the adhesin FimH undergoes a substantial structural change during transit across the usher pore, such that the receptor-binding lectin domain bends approximately 37° with respect to the pilin domain. Thus, FimH adopts an elongated conformation before transport across the usher pore 32 , 126 , whereas the lectin domain swings closer to the pilin domain after transport 32 . The two forms of the lectin domain have important implications for binding and pathogenesis: the elongated conformation binds mannose with a significantly higher affinity than the compact form 126 . Residues that control these conformational transitions have been shown to be under positive selection, and pathoadaptive alleles of FimH have subsequently been identified 126 – 128 . Thus, we now understand how protein–protein interactions and ligand binding can regulate a dynamic conformational equilibrium in the receptor-binding domain of FimH, and this is revealing unexpected insights into UTI pathogenesis and potentiating mannoside development. This unravelling of the dynamics of how allostery governs CUP pilus assembly and function is providing valuable information about macromolecular protein assembly and virulence in Gram-negative pathogens and is spawning new ways of thinking about drug development. Outlook\\nUTIs are some of the most common bacterial infections, resulting in billions of dollars in health care costs annually 1 . Both the numerous uropathogens, which encode a wide range of virulence factors, and the spread of antimicrobial resistance threaten the only effective treatment option available — antibiotics 15 , 17 . Moreover, high rates of recurrent UTIs suggest that antibiotics are not an effective therapy for all UTIs. Intensive studies have laid the foundations for conducting translational research that can identify essential mechanisms of virulence and provide evidence to guide the development of UTI treatments and prophylactics that are optimized against uropathogens and that do not alter the normal microflora. The identification of virulence determinants — specifically, those that are essential for initial attachment, including adhesins, and for the subsequent establishment of disease, including siderophores and urease — has allowed the development of targeted therapies that effectively neutralize pathogenic bacteria and prevent disease in animal models. By targeting the initial steps of infection — either through chemical compounds, such as mannosides and pilicides, or by vaccination with adhesins or siderophore receptors — these therapies aim to prevent uropathogens from gaining a foothold in the urinary tract.\\nAlthough great strides have been made in developing new strategies that might one day be of value in the treatment and prevention of UTIs, more work is needed. Although the FimH vaccine is in Phase I clinical trials, many of the other potential therapies, including mannosides, pilicides, and vaccines against siderophores, toxins and pili, are still in the preclinical stages of development and have been tested only in animal models. Importantly, the impact of these strategies on the endogenous microbiota should be considered. For example, although these antivirulence therapeutics are not expected to greatly affect the microbiota (as Enterobacteriaceae family members make up only a small portion of the gut flora), only the FimH vaccine has so far been demonstrated to have no effect on the normal composition of the gut microbiota 109 .\\nFinally, substantial effort should be put into setting up future clinical trials, which will be essential for translating these novel antivirulence therapies into new treatments that reduce the suffering associated with UTIs.

The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine. The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper stomach area. They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine. Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate. Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra.\\nMale urinary system\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nMale urinary system\\nMale urinary system\\nThe urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra.

Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate. Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra.\\nA urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system. The urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra.\\nWomen are at greater risk of developing a UTI than are men. If an infection is limited to the bladder, it can be painful and annoying. But serious health problems can result if a UTI spreads to the kidneys.\\nHealth care providers often treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics. You can also take steps to lower the chance of getting a UTI in the first place.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host–pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.\\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most common bacterial infections, affecting 150 million people each year worldwide 1 . In 2007, in the United States alone, there were an estimated 10.5 million office visits for UTI symptoms (constituting 0.9% of all ambulatory visits) and 2–3 million emergency department visits 2 – 4 . Currently, the societal costs of these infections, including health care costs and time missed from work, are approximately US$3.5 billion per year in the United States alone. UTIs are a significant cause of morbidity in infant boys, older men and females of all ages. Serious sequelae include frequent recurrences, pyelonephritis with sepsis, renal damage in young children, pre-term birth and complications caused by frequent antimicrobial use, such as high-level antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile colitis.\\nClinically, UTIs are categorized as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated UTIs typically affect individuals who are otherwise healthy and have no structural or neurological urinary tract abnormalities 5 , 6 ; these infections are differentiated into lower UTIs (cystitis) and upper UTIs (pyelonephritis) 5 , 7 . Several risk factors are associated with cystitis, including female gender, a prior UTI, sexual activity, vaginal infection, diabetes, obesity and genetic susceptibility 3 , 7 . Complicated UTIs are defined as UTIs associated with factors that compromise the urinary tract or host defence, including urinary obstruction, urinary retention caused by neurological disease, immunosuppression, renal failure, renal transplantation, pregnancy and the presence of foreign bodies such as calculi, indwelling catheters or other drainage devices 8 , 9 . In the United States, 70–80% of complicated UTIs are attributable to indwelling catheters 10 , accounting for 1 million cases per year 4 . Catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTIs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and are collectively the most common cause of secondary bloodstream infections. Risk factors for developing a CAUTI include prolonged catheterization, female gender, older age and diabetes 11 .\\nUTIs are caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as by certain fungi ( FIG. 1 ). The most common causative agent for both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). For the agents involved in uncomplicated UTIs, UPEC is followed in prevalence by Klebsiella pneumoniae , Staphylococcus saprophyticus , Enterococcus faecalis , group B Streptococcus (GBS), Proteus mirabilis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. 3 , 6 , 12 , 13 ( FIG. 1 ). For complicated UTIs, the order of prevalence for causative agents, following UPEC as most common, is Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae , Candida spp., S. aureus , P. mirabilis , P. aeruginosa and GBS 9 , 14 – 16 ( FIG. 1 ).\\nFigure 1. Epidemiology of urinary tract infections.\\nOpen in a new tab\\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by a wide range of pathogens, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as fungi. Uncomplicated UTIs typically affect women, children and elderly patients who are otherwise healthy. Complicated UTIs are usually associated with indwelling catheters, urinary tract abnormalities, immunosuppression or exposure to antibiotics. The most common causative agent for both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). For uncomplicated UTIs, other causative agents are (in order of prevalence) Klebsiella pneumoniae , Staphylococcus saprophyticus , Enterococcus faecalis , group B Streptococcus (GBS), Proteus mirabilis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. For complicated UTIs, the other causative agents are (in order of prevalence) Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae , Candida spp., S. aureus, P. mirabilis , P. aeruginosa and GBS. Patients suffering from a symptomatic UTI are commonly treated with antibiotics; these treatments can result in long-term alteration of the normal micro-biota of the vagina and gastrointestinal tract and in the development of multidrug-resistant microorganisms 17 . The availability of niches that are no longer filled by the altered microbiota can increase the risk of colonization with multidrug-resistant uropathogens. Importantly, the ‘golden era’ of antibiotics is waning, and the need for rationally designed and alternative treatments is therefore increasing. Recent studies have used RNA sequencing to directly analyse uropathogens from the urine of women experiencing symptomatic UTIs. These studies, together with basic science and improved animal models, have been crucial in enabling us to understand the molecular details of how uropathogens adhere, colonize and adapt to the nutritionally limited bladder environment; evade immune surveillance; and persist and disseminate in the urinary tract. These studies have therefore revealed key virulence factors that can be targeted to prevent and counteract the pathogenic mechanisms that are important in UTIs 7 , 17 , 18 . In this Review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis during bladder and kidney infection, comparing and contrasting the virulence factors used by the major uropathogens UPEC, K. pneumoniae , P. mirabilis , E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa . Furthermore, we discuss current antibiotic treatments, antibiotic resistance mechanisms, new combination therapies and future therapeutic interventions that use vaccines and small molecules to target virulence factors.\\nAdherence and colonization\\nAdherence is a key event initiating each step in UTI pathogenesis. A UTI typically starts with periurethral contamination by a uropathogen residing in the gut, followed by colonization of the urethra and subsequent migration of the pathogen to the bladder, an event that requires appendages such as flagella and pili ( FIG. 2 ). In the bladder, the consequences of complex host–pathogen interactions ultimately determine whether uropathogens are successful in colonization or eliminated.\\nFigure 2. Pathogenesis of urinary tract infections.\\nOpen in a new tab\\na | Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) begin when uropathogens that reside in the gut contaminate the periurethral area (step 1) and are able to colonize the urethra. Subsequent migration to the bladder (step 2) and expression of pili and adhesins results in colonization and invasion of the superficial umbrella cells (step 3). Host inflammatory responses, including neutrophil infiltration (step 4), begin to clear extracellular bacteria. Some bacteria evade the immune system, either through host cell invasion or through morphological changes that result in resistance to neutrophils, and these bacteria undergo multiplication (step 5) and biofilm formation (step 6). These bacteria produce toxins and proteases that induce host cell damage (step 7), releasing essential nutrients that promote bacterial survival and ascension to the kidneys (step 8). Kidney colonization (step 9) results in bacterial toxin production and host tissue damage (step 10). If left untreated, UTIs can ultimately progress to bacteraemia if the pathogen crosses the tubular epithelial barrier in the kidneys (step 11). b | Uropathogens that cause complicated UTIs follow the same initial steps as those described for uncomplicated infections, including periurethral colonization (step 1), progression to the urethra and migration to the bladder (step 2). However, in order for the pathogens to cause infection, the bladder must be compromised. The most common cause of a compromised bladder is catheterization. Owing to the robust immune response induced by catheterization (step 3), fibrinogen accumulates on the catheter, providing an ideal environment for the attachment of uropathogens that express fibrinogen-binding proteins. Infection induces neutrophil infiltration (step 4), but after their initial attachment to the fibrinogen-coated catheters, the bacteria multiply (step 5), form biofilms (step 6), promote epithelial damage (step 7) and can seed infection of the kidneys (steps 8 and 9), where toxin production induces tissue damage (step 10). If left untreated, uropathogens that cause complicated UTIs can also progress to bacteraemia by crossing the tubular epithelial cell barrier (step 11). Multiple bacterial adhesins recognize receptors on the bladder epithelium (also known as the uroepithelium) and mediate colonization ( TABLE 1 ). Uropathogens such as UPEC survive by invading the bladder epithelium, producing toxins and proteases to release nutrients from the host cells, and synthesizing siderophores to obtain iron ( FIG. 2 ; TABLE 1 ). By multiplying and overcoming host immune surveillance, the uropathogens can subsequently ascend to the kidneys, again attaching via adhesins or pili to colonize the renal epithelium and then producing tissue-damaging toxins ( FIG. 2 ; TABLE 1 ). Consequently, the uropathogens are able to cross the tubular epithelial barrier to access the blood stream, initiating bacteraemia.\\nTable 1.\\nVirulence factors used by the main uropathogens\\nUropathogen\\nVirulence factors\\nRefs\\nAdherence\\nToxin\\nImmune evasion\\nIron acquisition\\nOther\\nUPEC\\nF1C pili\\nP pili\\nS pili\\nType 1 pili\\nDr adhesins\\nHlyA\\nCNF1\\nHlyA\\nCapsular antigens\\nCNF1\\nYersiniabactin\\nAerobactin\\nEnterobactin\\nSalmochelin\\nYersiniabactin\\nAntigen43\\nFlagella\\n6 , 33 , 63 , 93 , 96 , 141 , 142\\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\\nType 1 pili\\nType 3 pili\\nND\\nCapsule\\nAerobactin\\nEnterobactin\\nND\\n49 – 51 , 143 , 144\\nProteus mirabilis\\nMR/P pili\\nNAFs\\nPMFs\\nAipA adhesin\\nTaaP adhesin\\nHaemolysins (HpmA and HlyA)\\nPta\\nCapsule\\nZapA\\nProteobactin\\nYersiniabactin-related\\nFlagella\\nUrease\\n6 , 53 , 97 , 145\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\\nExtracellular DNA\\nExopolysaccharides (alginate, PEL and PSL)\\nND\\nCapsule\\nElastase\\nExoS\\nPhospholipase\\nRhamnolipids\\nPyochelin\\nPyoverdin\\nQuorum sensing\\n81 , 86 , 137 , 146 , 147\\nStaphylococcus saprophyticus\\nAas adhesin\\nSdrI adhesin\\nUaf adhesin\\nAas\\nND\\nND\\nUrease\\n84 , 148 , 149\\nEnterococcus faecalis\\nEbp pili\\nAce adhesin\\nEsp adhesin\\nND\\nEpa\\nND\\nSortase A\\nSigV\\nMsrA and MsrB\\n54 , 55 , 61\\nEnterococcus faecium\\nEbp pili\\nEsp adhesin\\nND\\nND\\nND\\nND\\n54\\nOpen in a new tab\\nAipA, adhesion and invasion mediated by the Proteus autotransporter; CNF1, cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1; Ebp, endocarditis- and biofilm-associated; Epa, enterococcal polysaccharide antigen; Esp, enterococcal surface protein; ExoS, exoenzyme S; F1C pili, type 1-like immunological group C pili; HlyA, α-haemolysin; HpmA, haemolysin; MR/P, mannose-resistant Proteus -like; Msr, methionine sulfoxide reductase; NAF, non-agglutinating fimbria; ND, not determined; PMF, P. mirabilis -like fimbria; P pili, pyelonephritis-associated pili; Pta, Proteus toxic agglutinin; TaaP, trimeric autoagglutinin autotransporter of Proteus ; UPEC, uropathogenic Escherichia coli . The uropathogens that cause uncomplicated UTIs, including UPEC, K. pneumoniae and S. saprophyticus , have the ability to bind directly to the bladder epithelium, which is composed of the umbrella cells (also known as superficial facet cells), intermediate cells and basal cells 19 ( TABLE 1 ). UPEC and K. pneumoniae bind to uroplakins, which are the major protein components of the umbrella cell apical membrane 19 and which form a crystalline array protecting the mammalian bladder tissue from damaging agents in urine 20 . In addition to uroplakins, α 3 β 1 integrins, which are expressed at the surface of uroepithelial cells, can also serve as receptors for UPEC 21 . By contrast, complicated UTIs are initiated when the bacteria bind to a urinary catheter, a kidney stone or a bladder stone, or when they are retained in the urinary tract by a physical obstruction. Some pathogens (for example, UPEC) can cause both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. However, others such as P. mirabilis , P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp. predominantly cause complicated UTIs ( FIG. 2 ). Subsequently, these uropathogens often form biofilms that are responsible for colonization and persistence 22 , 23 ( BOX 1 ).\\nBox 1. Biofilms and morphological plasticity.\\nUropathogens use different mechanisms for survival in response to stresses in the bladder such as starvation and immune responses. By forming biofilms and undergoing morphological changes, uropathogens can persist and cause recurrent infections 40 , 129 , 130 .\\nBiofilm formation\\nExtracellular DNA (eDNA), exopolysaccharides called extracellular polymeric substances, pili, flagella and other adhesive fibres create a scaffold to form a multicellular bacterial community that is protected from immune responses, antimicrobial agents and other stresses 40 . The antimicrobial recalcitrance of uropathogens increases on biofilm maturation, as the biofilm provides a physical barrier to antibiotic entry. Therefore, understanding species-specific biofilm formation and dispersal mechanisms is crucial for the development of novel therapies that prevent colonization, such as biofilm inhibitors, anti-adhesive molecules and molecules that induce bacterial dispersion.\\nUropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) forms biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) that protect their members from neutrophils, antibiotics and other stresses 38 ( FIG. 3 ). Type 1 pili, antigen 43 and adhesive surface fibres called curli induce biofilm formation by mediating interbacterial interactions and attachment to surfaces. Transcription of antigen 43 is regulated by oxidative stress regulator (OxyR; also known as hydrogen peroxide-inducible genes activator) 131 , whereas type 1 pilus and curli fibre genes are regulated by polymyxin-resistant protein B (PrmB; also known as BasS) on iron sensing 3 , leading to phosphorylation of polymyxin-resistant protein A (PmrA; also known as BasR) and quorum sensing regulator B (QseB) 131 . UPEC biofilm formation on catheters is dependent on type 1 pili 35 .\\nProteus mirabilis produces urease, which hydrolyses urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia. This increases the urine pH and generates calcium crystals and magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitates, which are incorporated into polysaccharide capsules, forming crystalline biofilms on the catheter ( FIG. 4 ). The phosphotransferase regulator of swarming behaviour (RsbA) upregulates polysaccharide expression, represses swarming 23 and enhances biofilm formation. Mannose-resistant Proteus -like (MR/P) pili intimately associate with the crystal layers, promoting biofilm formation. Oxygen limitation in the biofilm activates the expression of MR/P pili by inducing the recombinase MrpI to reorient the promoter of the pilus genes. Similarly, expression of the fimbrial operon regulator MrpJ leads to decreased motility, promoting biofilm formation 53 , 132 .\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa has the ability to form biofilms on catheters and damaged bladder tissue 82 through several mechanisms, including quorum sensing autoinducers that bind to the transcriptional regulators LasR (which regulates elastase (LasB) expression) and RhlR (which regulates the synthesis of rhamnolipids). Quorum sensing induces the production of eDNA, rhamnolipids, lectins, elastases and toxins. The amphiphilic rhamnolipids allow microcolony formation by changing the hydrophobicity of the P. aeruginosa surface 133 . Biofilm maturation is promoted by lectin adhesins, which are important for bacterial cell–cell interactions 134 . The production of alginates and extracellular polymeric substances is activated when cyclic di-GMP binds to the transcriptional regulators alginate biosynthesis 44 (Alg44) and pellicle formation regulator D (PelD) 135 . Small RNAs from the regulator of secondary metabolites ( rsm ) family, such as rsmZ and rsmY , regulate exopolysaccharide production by reducing the availability of RsmA, which is the transcriptional repressor for exopolysaccharide-encoding genes 81 , 136 , 137 . Morphological changes\\nUropathogens also adopt morphological changes, such as filamentation, to circumvent the host immune system 130 , 138 . During IBC maturation, expression of suppressor of lon (SulA) inhibits FtsZ polymerization in a subpopulation of UPEC, blocking septation ring formation and cell division 138 . When the resulting filamentous bacterial cells emerge from epithelial cells, they are resistant to killing by neutrophils and can colonize other naive uroepithelial cells and re-enter the IBC cycle 129 , 138 ( FIG. 3 ). Alternatively, during colonization by P. mirabilis , the bacteria adopt a filamentous morphology as a result of the sensor activities of flagella on contact with a urinary catheter. Contact creates a torsional change in the outer membrane, and this is sensed by upregulator of the flagellar master operon (Umo) proteins, which induce the expression of flagella to produce the highly flagellated cells that are required for swarming during a UTI 6 , 23 , 53 , 139 ( FIG. 4 ). Chaperone–usher pathway pili\\nMany uropathogens initiate a UTI using pili that mediate adhesion to host and environmental surfaces, facilitate invasion into the host tissues and promote interbacterial interactions to form biofilms 24 – 27 . For example, numerous Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria — including E. coli , Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Haemophilus spp., Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp. 16 , 27 – 29 — express a large, highly conserved family of adhesive fibres called chaperone–usher pathway (CUP) pili 25 , 26 . CUP pili are assembled by the chaperone–usher molecular machinery 24 , 25 and are composed of pilin subunits with incomplete immunoglobulin-like folds that lack the typical carboxy-terminal seventh β-strand 30 , 31 . Briefly, in a process termed donor-strand complementation, a dedicated periplasmic chaperone ‘donates’ a β-strand to complete the immunoglobulin fold of the subunits, forming a complex with each subunit and ensuring their proper folding and stabilization. The chaperone–subunit complex is then targeted to the usher assembly protein in the outer membrane, where the usher selectively differentiates chaperone–subunit complexes and catalyses the ordered assembly of pili on the cell surface via a mechanism termed donor-strand exchange. During donor-strand exchange, the final folding of a subunit occurs as the donated β-strand of the chaperone is replaced by an amino-terminal extension on the next incoming subunit 32 . Importantly, understanding the most basic principles of molecular biology — such as how a protein folds into domains that serve as assembly modules for building large supramolecular structures, and how an outer-membrane macromolecular machine (the usher) assembles these structures from individual subunits, which are delivered as chaperone–subunit complexes and then transported in a regulated manner across a biological membrane — has led to the development of anti-virulence compounds that block CUP pilus assembly or function and that result in the dysregulation of virulence factors. These compounds have the potential for broad-spectrum activity against numerous Gram-negative bacteria (see below). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli\\nThirty-eight distinct CUP pilus operons have been identified in E. coli genomes, and a single UPEC strain can encode more than 12 different CUP pili 25 . However, the distribution of CUP operons is not uniform across different UPEC isolates; some operons are found ubiquitously in UPEC, whereas others are present in only a handful of strains. The multitude of CUP pili encoded by UPEC are tipped with different adhesins, some of which are known to mediate distinct tropisms in the lower and upper urinary tract by recognizing receptors with stereochemical specificity, notably in the bladder or kidney epithelium 33 .\\nType 1 pili and pyelonephritis-associated (P) pili are the better characterized CUP pili. Type 1 pili are essential for colonization, invasion and persistence of UPEC in the mouse bladder 34 ( FIG. 3 ). Type 1 pili are tipped with the adhesin FimH 7 , which recognizes mannosylated uroplakins and α 1 β 3 integrins with stereochemical specificity 21 , 35 to initiate colonization and invasion into umbrella cells 7 , 21 . Type 1 pili binding to these cells triggers a signal transduction cascade that activates Rho GTPases, such as those from the Rac family, to cause actin rearrangement and internalization of UPEC by a zippering mechanism consisting of a plasma membrane sheathe that engulfs the bacterium 36 ( FIG. 3 ). Invasion allows UPEC to subvert certain host defences and become recalcitrant to antibiotic treatments. However, an innate defence expulsion mechanism defends the uroepithelium from UPEC invasion; this expulsion mechanism depends on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression by uroepithelial cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated activation of TLR4 stimulates adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3) to produce cyclic AMP, which induces the exocytosis of vesicular UPEC into the apical plasma membrane of the umbrella cells 37 ( FIG. 3 ). Importantly, by escaping into the cytoplasm (through an unknown mechanism), UPEC can subvert the expulsion pathway and rapidly multiply, forming transient biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) 38 , 39 ( BOX 1 ; FIG. 3 ). After their maturation, bacteria disperse from the IBC to invade other cells, where the IBC cycle is repeated 38 – 40 . IBC formation is a common mechanism for clinical UPEC isolates and has been observed in multiple mouse backgrounds and also in exfoliated uroepithelial cells in the urine of patients with acute UTIs but not in the cells in urine from healthy controls 41 , 42 . The process of invasion and IBC formation provides UPEC with the ability to survive stringent bottlenecks in the urinary tract, including TLR4-mediated expulsion, umbrella cell exfoliation, ascension to the kidneys, urination and inflammation 7 , 43 . UPEC also establishes quiescent intracellular reservoirs (QIRs) in underlying transitional cells, within membrane-bound compartments enmeshed in F-actin ( FIG. 3 ). In contrast to the metabolically active IBCs, QIRs typically contain 4–10 non-replicating bacteria that can remain viable for months and can be re-activated to serve as seeds that initiate a recurrent UTI 7 . It has been proposed that during uroepithelial turnover, in which the underlying immature cells terminally differentiate into umbrella cells, the redistribution of actin and perhaps other associated signals might trigger UPEC revival from QIRs, releasing the bacteria back into the bladder lumen 44 .\\nFigure 3. Virulence factors of uropathogenic Escherichia coli that contribute to urinary tract infections.\\nOpen in a new tab\\na | In the bladder, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) expression of type 1 pili is essential for colonization, invasion and persistence. The type 1 pilus adhesin, FimH, binds mannosylated uroplakins and integrins that coat the surface of umbrella cells. Uroplakin binding by FimH induces actin rearrangement and bacterial internalization via unknown mechanisms. FimH–α 3 β 1 integrin interactions induce actin rearrangement via activation of RHO-family GTPases (such as RAC proteins), resulting in bacterial invasion. Inside the host cell, UPEC can subvert host defences and resist antibiotic treatment. However, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released by UPEC is sensed by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which induces cyclic AMP (cAMP) production via adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3) activation, resulting in exocytosis of vesicular UPEC across the apical plasma membrane. UPEC subverts this innate defence mechanism by escaping into the cytoplasm, where it then multiplies to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). Maturation of IBCs causes bacterial dispersal and allows the invasion of other host cells, which enables UPEC to re-enter the IBC cycle. Alternatively, UPEC can establish quiescent intracellular reservoirs (QIRs) in the underlying transitional cells. QIRs consist of 4–10 non-replicating bacteria within membrane-bound compartments encased in F-actin and can remain viable for months. In addition, UPEC survives within the harsh bladder environment by secreting several factors that are important for nutrient acquisition. The toxin α-haemolysin (HlyA) promotes host cell lysis through pore formation, facilitating iron release and nutrient acquisition. The siderophores expressed by UPEC allow the bacterium to scavenge iron and thus promote survival during a urinary tract infection (UTI). HlyA also triggers epithelial exfoliation to promote the spread of UPEC to other hosts following urine expulsion or to expose deeper layers of the uroepithelium for QIRs. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) is also important for host cell remodelling and functions by binding to the receptor basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) on host cells to induce constitutive activation of the RHO GTPases RAC1, RHOA and cell division control 42 (CDC42), resulting in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane ruffling. Activation of RAC1 also induces the host cell anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways, preventing apoptosis of colonized epithelial cells and allowing the UPEC population to expand. The extracellular survival of UPEC also requires evasion of the innate immune system by the adoption of a filamentous morphology, which renders the bacterium more resistant to neutrophil killing than their bacillary form. b | UPEC colonization of the kidneys is dependent on expression of pyelonephritis-associated (P) pili, which bind globoside-containing glycolipids lining the renal tissue. The P pilus adhesin, PapG, also interacts with TLR4, reducing the expression of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR). This results in impaired immunoglobulin A (IgA) transport across the epithelium, thereby modulating the local secretory antibody immune response and preventing UPEC opsonization and clearance. Unlike the mannose-binding adhesin FimH of type 1 pili, the adhesin of P pili, PapG, binds globosides containing glycolipids that are present in the human kidneys 33 ( FIG. 3 ). In addition, PapG modulates the local secretory-antibody immune response by interacting with TLR4 to reduce polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PlGR) expression, thus impairing immunoglobulin A transport through the lamina propria and epithelial cells to the kidney lumen 45 ( FIG. 3 ). By inhibiting immunoglobulin A transport into the urinary space, UPEC evades a key host protective mechanism, allowing the establishment of ascending infection 45 , 46 .\\nImportantly, the initial innate host response to UPEC colonization and invasion not only dictates the outcome of the original infection but is also crucial for determining host susceptibility to subsequent infections 39 . An increased susceptibility to recurrent UTIs can occur not because of a deficient host response to UPEC infection, as is commonly accepted, but rather as a result of an unrestrained lymphocyte-dependent innate inflammatory response to acute infection, leading to severe acute injury to the mucosal uroepithelium and potentiating subsequent infections 39 . Klebsiella pneumoniae\\nSimilarly to UPEC, K. pneumoniae uses type 1 pili for biofilm formation and bladder colonization 47 ( TABLE 1 ). Interestingly, although the K. pneumoniae adhesin FimH is highly homologous to UPEC FimH, they have different binding specificities 48 . K. pneumoniae FimH-mediated biofilm formation is inhibited by heptyl mannose, as opposed to the methyl mannose-mediated inhibition of UPEC FimH. Moreover, K. pneumoniae FimH has a weaker adherence to the bladder than UPEC FimH, resulting in significantly lower K. pneumoniae titers in the mouse bladder and fewer IBCs than are seen for UPEC. Despite the relatively poor adhesive properties of K. pneumoniae FimH in the urinary tract, it remains an important virulence factor for K. pneumoniae during colonization, biofilm formation and persistence in both UTIs and CAUTIs 48 – 50 . In addition , K. pneumoniae encodes numerous other CUP pili, including type 3 pili, which also play an important part in colonization, biofilm formation and persistence during UTIs and in biofilm formation during CAUTIs 35 , 51 , 52 . Proteus mirabilis\\nFollowing initial attachment, P. mirabilis produces mannose-resistant Proteus -like (MR/P) pili, which are CUP pili that facilitate biofilm formation and colonization of the bladder and kidneys, and are crucial for catheter-associated biofilm formation 6 , 16 , 23 , 53 ( BOX 1 ; FIG. 4 ). Other CUP pili encoded by P. mirabilis include P. mirabilis -like fimbriae (PMFs), which are important for bladder and kidney colonization 53 , and non-agglutinating fimbriae (NAFs), which are able to attach to uroepithelial cells in vitro 53 . However, the in vivo mechanistic roles of PMFs, NAFs and their receptors have not yet been established.\\nFigure 4. Mechanisms of pathogenesis during catheter-associated urinary tract infections.\\nOpen in a new tab\\na | Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) mediated by Proteus mirabilis depend on the expression of mannose-resistant Proteus -like (MR/P) pili for initial attachment, and for biofilm formation on the catheter and in the bladder. Subsequent urease production induces the formation of calcium crystals and magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitates in the urine through the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia, resulting in a high pH. The production of extracellular polymeric substances by bacteria attached to the catheter traps these crystals, allowing the formation of a crystalline biofilm, which protects the community from the host immune system and from antibiotics. In addition, these structures prevent proper urine drainage, resulting in reflux and promoting the progression to pyelonephritis, septicaemia and shock. Finally, production of the bacterial toxins haemolysin (HpmA) and Proteus toxic agglutinin (Pta) is important for tissue destruction and bacterial dissemination to the kidneys. HpmA induces pore formation by inserting itself into the cell membrane and destabilizing the host cell, causing tissue damage, exfoliation and nutrient release. Pta punctures the host cell membrane, causing cytosol leakage and resulting in osmotic stress and depolymerization of actin filaments, thus compromising the structural integrity of the cell. The release of nutrients via these toxins also allows the bacteria to scavenge iron using siderophores. b |\\nEnterococcus faecalis pathogenesis during CAUTIs depends on catheter implantation, which results in bladder inflammation and causes fibrinogen release, deposition onto the catheter, and accumulation. E. faecalis takes advantage of the presence of fibrinogen and uses it as a food source through the production of proteases. E. faecalis also binds fibrinogen through the endocarditis- and biofilm-associated (Ebp) pilus, allowing the formation of biofilms that protect the bacteria against the immune system. In addition to CUP pili, P. mirabilis encodes two autotransporters, TaaP (trimeric autoagglutinin autotransporter of Proteus ) and AipA (adhesion and invasion mediated by the Proteus autotransporter), which are important for bladder and kidney infection, respectively 53 . AipA can adhere to human bladder and kidney cell lines in vitro but is only required for kidney infection (and not for bladder infection) in mice. Conversely, TaaP is required for bladder infection by P. mirabilis in mice. Importantly, both autotransporters bind to extracellular-matrix proteins in vitro: AipA preferentially binds to collagen I, and TaaP to laminin, which might provide an explanation for their different tissue tropisms. Enterococci\\nEnterococci encode several adhesion factors, including the collagen adhesin Ace, enterococcal surface protein (Esp), enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (Epa), and endocarditis- and biofilm-associated (Ebp) pili 54 ( TABLE 1 ). Of these, Ebp pili contribute to CAUTIs 54 – 56 and are required for persistence during infection 55 , 56 . Clinical studies have shown that mechanical stress induced by urinary catheterization produces histological and immunological changes in the bladder, resulting in a robust inflammatory response, exfoliation, oedema, and mucosal lesions of the uroepithelium and kidneys 57 , 58 . Importantly, a mouse model of CAUTI seems to recapitulate these immunological changes that are induced by urinary catheterization, exhibiting catheter-induced inflammation, severe uroepithelial damage, exfoliation and the onset of bladder wall oedema, which is exacerbated by increased catheterization time 59 . Urinary catheters provide a surface for E. faecalis attachment and biofilm formation, which promotes E. faecalis persistence in the bladder and further dissemination to the kidneys 55 ( FIG. 4 ). However, E. faecalis is unable to bind to catheter material in vitro and is unable to grow in urine 60 . This apparent paradox was resolved by the finding that urinary catheterization induces fibrinogen release into the bladder as part of the inflammatory response; this fibrinogen subsequently accumulates in the bladder and is deposited on the implanted catheter 60 ( FIGS 2 , 4 ). Following fibrinogen deposition, the Ebp pilus adhesin — EbpA, which contains an N-terminal fibrinogen-binding domain — mediates catheter colonization and biofilm formation during CAUTIs caused by E. faecalis 60 , 61 ( FIG. 4 ). Furthermore, E. faecalis can use fibrinogen for growth, enhancing biofilm formation on the catheter 60 ( FIG. 4 ). This resolution of the paradox has been recapitulated in vitro by the demonstration that E. faecalis attaches to fibrinogen-coated catheters and grows in urine supplemented with fibrinogen 60 . Other virulence factors\\nThe bladder environment is limited in nutrients; thus, in order to survive and grow within the urinary tract, uropathogens produce proteases and toxins that damage the host tissue to release nutrients, while also providing a niche for bacterial invasion and dissemination ( TABLE 1 ).\\nProteases and toxins\\nUPEC secretes high concentrations of α-haemolysin (HlyA), which oligomerizes and integrates in the cholesterol-rich microdomains in the host cell membrane in a Ca + -dependent manner 62 , 63 . This results in pore formation in the umbrella cells and promotes their lysis, which facilitates iron and nutrient acquisition by the bacteria ( FIG. 3 ). HlyA also triggers exfoliation, exposing deeper layers of the uroepithelium for colonization and promoting bacterial spread to other hosts following cell expulsion in the urine 62 – 65 ( FIG. 3 ). Furthermore, HlyA is highly expressed in IBCs, suggesting that it is important during this stage of infection 39 , 63 , 66 .\\nUPEC also secretes cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), which affects actin remodelling in the host cell through three small RHO GTPases: RAC1, RHOA and cell division control 42 (CDC42) 67 , 68 . CNF1 enters the host cell in endocytic vesicles, by binding to the receptor basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM; also known as LU) 69 , and then constitutively activates RHO GTPases via deamination of a glutamine residue; this causes actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane ruffling, leading to increased levels of bacterial internalization 67 , 70 . In addition, the activation of RAC1–GTP induces the host cell anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways (through the interaction of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT (also known as PKB) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)); this prevents apoptosis of the colonized uroepithelium, thus facilitating UPEC survival and protecting the niche 67 , 71 ( FIG. 3 ).\\nP. mirabilis produce two toxins, haemolysin (HpmA) and Proteus toxic agglutinin (Pta), which are implicated in tissue damage and dissemination to the kidneys, initiating acute pyelonephritis 16 , 72 . HpmA is a Ca + -dependent pore-forming cytolysin that destabilizes the host cell by inserting itself into the cell membrane and causing a Na + efflux 16 ( FIG. 4 ). By contrast, the surface-associated cytotoxic protease Pta is functional only in an alkaline pH, such as that induced by the activity of P. mirabilis urease 73 . In the proposed mode of action, Pta punctures the host cell membrane, causing leakage of the cytosol, osmotic stress and depolymerization of actin filaments; the structural integrity of the cell is therefore compromised, resulting in bladder and kidney damage 53 , 73 ( FIG. 4 ). Pta also induces bacterial cell–cell interaction via autoaggregation 53 , 73 .\\nP. aeruginosa produces elastases, exoenzyme S (ExoS) and haemolytic phospholipase C, all of which have been implicated in UTI initiation and dissemination, and subsequent pyelonephritis 74 , 75 ( TABLE 1 ). The GTPase activity of ExoS downregulates macrophage RAC1 function, interfering with lamellopodium formation and inducing membrane ruffle formation. The ADP-ribosyltransfease activity of ExoS targets RHO family proteins (RAS proteins and RalA), affecting cell adherence and morphology 76 . Elastase induces tissue destruction through its protease activity, releasing nutrients (including iron) for continued bacterial growth 77 . Phospholipase C is an α-toxin that hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine from the host cell membrane, compromising cell integrity and resulting in organ damage 78 – 80 . The expression of all of these virulence factors is regulated by the quorum sensing system 81 . Quorum sensing is activated at high cell density by the accumulation of small molecules called autoinducers. When a threshold level of autoinducers is reached, they bind to transcriptional activator proteins and activate the expression of virulence factors 81 , 82 ( BOX 1 ). Urease\\nUrease is encoded by several uropathogens, including P. mirabilis 53 , 83 , S. saprophyticus 84 , K. pneumoniae 85 and P. aureginosa 86 , and is important for colonization and persistence during P. mirabilis and S. saprophyticus UTIs 83 , 84 ( FIG. 4 ; TABLE 1 ). This enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia 87 , resulting in elevated urine pH and the production of calcium crystals (apatite) and magnesium ammonium phosphate ammoprecipitates (struvite) in urine and on catheters 53 ( FIG. 4 ). Importantly, the accumulation of ammonia becomes toxic for the uroepithelial cells, inducing direct tissue damage 88 . The P. mirabilis urease, one of the best studied ureases involved in UTIs, is a Ni 2+ -dependent metalloenzyme that is essential for colonization of the bladder and kidneys and promotes the formation of stones 23 , 53 , 87 . The P. mirabilis urease is induced by urea and is constitutively expressed during growth in urine 89 . This urease is highly active, hydrolysing urea several times faster than those produced by other species, such as Providencia stuartii , Providencia rettgeri , Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii 90 . The high activity level of the P. mirabilis enzyme induces rapid crystal formation, and these crystals become trapped within the polysaccharides produced by attached bacterial cells, forming crystalline biofilms on catheters 23 , 89 , 91 . The crystalline biofilms provide P. mirabilis with protection from the host immune system and antibiotics 88 ( BOX 1 ; FIG. 4 ). These structures also block urine drainage from the ureters, potentially resulting in reflux and promoting progression to pyelonephritis, septicaemia and shock 53 . Iron scavenging\\nThe bladder environment is limited in iron. Thus, to be able to grow in human urine, uropathogens utilize siderophore systems for iron (Fe 3+ ) scavenging; these systems are composed of the siderophore assembly machinery, a siderophore responsible for binding iron and a membrane receptor that internalizes the iron bound to the siderophore 92 ( TABLE 1 ).\\nUPEC produces several siderophores 93 , of which two — aerobactin and yersiniabactin — are essential in the urinary tract 93 ( FIG. 3 ). Aerobactin is highly expressed, stable at low pH and displays higher levels of iron binding than enterobactin 94 , 95 . Yersiniabactin is important in bio-film formation in urine and has a protective role against intracellular killing by copper stress, as it sequesters host-derived copper 96 .\\nNumerous iron-scavenging siderophore systems are utilized by other uropathogens: K. pneumoniae produces enterobactin and aerobactin 85 ; P. mirabilis uses proteobactin and yersiniabactin-related 97 ; and P. aeruginosa produces pyochelin and pyoverdin 86 ( TABLE 1 ). Siderophore systems are important potential targets for vaccine development 98 and for designing small molecules that interfere with their function. Treatment of urinary tract infections\\nUTIs result in considerable economic and public health burdens and substantially affect the life quality of afflicted individuals 17 . Currently, antibiotics — such as trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and ampicillin — are the most commonly recommended therapeutics for UTIs 4 . However, increasing rates of antibiotic resistance and high recurrence rates threaten to greatly enhance the burden that these common infections place on society. Ideally, alternative therapies will be established that will be recalcitrant to the development of resistance. Many promising approaches are being developed, from leveraging what we have learned about the basic biology of UTI pathogenesis to specifically target virulence pathways. These antivirulence therapeutics should theoretically allow us to effectively neutralize, or ‘disarm’, the capacity of UTI pathogens to cause disease, without altering the gut commensal microbiota, because antivirulence therapeutics target processes that are critical for UTI pathogenesis but that are not required for the essential processes of growth and cell division (which are the targets of conventional antibiotics).\\nBelow, we discuss the current challenges that have arisen from the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains and highlight the progress that is being made towards the development of antivirulence therapeutics for UTIs. We also discuss how an understanding of the evolution of bacterial resistance mechanisms and their spread is providing new approaches for the modification and improvement of current therapeutic options.\\nMultidrug resistance\\nUTIs are becoming increasingly difficult to treat owing to the widespread emergence of an array of antibiotic resistance mechanisms 3 , 4 , 15 , 99 – 102 (see Supplementary information S1 (table) ). Of particular concern are members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli and K. pneumoniae , which have both acquired plasmids encoding extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). These plasmids rapidly spread resistance to third-generation cephalosporins as well as other antibiotics 15 , 99 – 103 ( BOX 2 ). Other Enterobacteriaceae family members produce the class C β-lactamases (AmpC enzymes) that are active against cephamycin in addition to third-generation cephalosporins, and are also resistant to β-lactamase inhibitors 99 – 102 . The expression of AmpC enzymes is also associated with carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae strains lacking a 42 kDa outer-membrane protein 15 , 99 – 102 ( BOX 2 ).\\nBox 2. Antibiotic resistance.\\nMultidrug-resistant uropathogenic organisms are becoming an expanding public health threat, as Enterobacteriaceae family members increasingly acquire extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) such as cefotaximases (CTX-Ms) and oxacillinases (OXAs), AmpC-type β-lactamases and carbapenemases.\\nESBLs\\nOriginating in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli , ESBLs are now prevalent throughout the Enterobacteriaceae family, as frequent use of cephalosporins in the nosocomial setting and the carriage of ESBL-encoding genes on transferrable elements together create an ideal environment for the selection of antibiotic resistance 99 , 102 . ESBLs are plasmid-encoded or chromosomally encoded β-lactamases with broad activity against penicillins and cephalosporins. They function by splitting the amide bond of the β-lactam ring, thus inactivating β-lactam antibiotics 102 . Troublingly, ESBLs are encoded on plasmids that typically carry other resistance genes which provide activity against aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and quinolones, making the bacteria that acquire these plasmids multidrug resistant 101 , 102 . CTX-Ms\\nThe plasmids encoding the ESBLs CTX-Ms form a new plasmid phylum that is phylogenetically distinct from other plasmid-encoded β-lactamases. CTX-Ms are active against narrow-, broad- and extended-spectrum penicillins, classical and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and monobactams 99 , 102 , 103 . Notably, they also confer high-level cefotaxime resistance 99 , 103 . CTX-Ms are the most prevalent β-lactamases in community-associated isolates and are typically encoded on plasmids with other resistance genes 102 . CTX-Ms efficiently hydrolyse the β-lactam ring via nucleophilic attack of a ring carbonyl carbon by a conserved serine in the β-lactamase, resulting in a ring-opened product that is inactive 140 . OXAs\\nOXAs are ESBLs that are typically encoded by plasmids and mediate resistance to ampicillin, cephalothin, oxacillin and cloxacillin by hydrolysing the β-lactam rings 99 , 103 . In addition, OXAs are characterized by their ability to resist the β-lactamase inhibitor clavulante 103 . To date, OXAs have been shown to be expressed only in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 99 , 103 . AmpC enzymes\\nThe chromosomally encoded AmpC enzymes hydrolyse penicillins, third-generation and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and cephamycins, and are resistant to β-lactamase inhibitors, including clavulanate 99 , 102 . AmpC expression is induced in response to β-lactams, cephamycin and cephalosporin exposure. Carbapenemases\\nCarbapenemases are ESBLs that confer the ability to inactive carbapenems in addition to penicillins and extended-spectrum cephalosporins 99 , 101 , 102 . The two most clinically relevant carbapenemases, K. pneumoniae (serine) carbapenemase (KPC) and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1), originated in K. pneumoniae and rapidly spread throughout the Enterobacteriaceae family, creating carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) 15 , 99 , 101 , 102 . The broad activity of carbapenemases confers resistance against a wide range of extended-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics, particularly carbapenem. Multidrug resistance is also common among enterococci, as they are naturally resistant to trimethoprim, clindamycin, cephalosporins and penicillins 15 , 101 , 102 . Recently, Enterococcus spp. have developed high-level resistance to glycopeptides, including vancomycin, which is considered to be one of the last lines of defence against multidrug-resistant organisms. Specifically, enterococci evolved resistance to glycopeptides through the expression of vancomycin and teicoplanin A-type resistance ( van ) genes that encode the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) VanA, VanB, VanD, VanE, VanG and VanL 101 , 102 . The mechanism of resistance for VanA, the most common PBP expressed by enterococci, is to replace the cell wall precursor D-alanine–D-alanine with D-alanine–D-lactose, effectively reducing the binding affinity of vancomycin 104 . The troubling trend towards a high prevalence of multi-drug-resistant uropathogens has spurred the development of alternative control measures and treatment options. Combination therapies\\nNew antimicrobials that are resistant to inactivation by ESBLs are under development for use in combination with new classes of β-lactamase inhibitors, which target both β-lactamases and K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) 105 – 107 . These combination therapies have been shown to be effective in vitro against carbapenem-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, clinical trials involving complicated UTIs revealed that ceftazidime, a third-generation cephalosporin that is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, is effective against ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria when combined with the β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam 105 . Future studies are needed to test the efficacy of ceftazidime–avibactam against ESBL-, KPC- and AmpC-producing Gram-negative pathogens during infection, as the drug combination has the potential to be effective against a broad range of cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae family members. Although these antibiotic–inhibitor combinations are promising, the development of resistance to β-lactamase inhibitors is not well characterized 105 . Moreover, the effectiveness of specific antibiotic–inhibitor therapies is dependent on the antimicrobial-resistance patterns encoded by each pathogen, as the expression of certain combinations of ESBLs and carbapenemases can provide resistance to an antibiotic–inhibitor therapy 105 – 107 . For example, the combination of BAL30072–BAL29880 –clavulanate (two β-lactam antibiotics and a β-lactamase inhibitor) is effective against many carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae family members, but K. pneumoniae strains that typically produce KPCs and SHVs (another type of ESBL), or AmpC enzymes are resistant 106 . Therefore, it is crucial to know which antibiotic mechanisms are available to a specific uropathogen in order to determine an effective treatment. Vaccines targeting bacterial adhesion\\nAs adherence has a key role at nearly every step of UTI pathogenesis, one attractive strategy for the development of antivirulence therapies, including vaccines, has been to target CUP pili. As a general rule, vaccination with whole pili has been ineffective at generating an antibody response that can protect against UTIs. However, adhesin-based vaccines have been shown to be effective at blocking host–pathogen interactions, thus preventing the establishment of disease 108 – 112 . Experiments using mouse and cynomolgus monkey models of UTIs determined that immunization with PapD–PapG or FimC–FimH chaperone–adhesin complexes protected against UTIs 108 – 112 . The effectiveness of the FimC–FimH vaccine was shown to be due, in large part, to antibodies that block the function of FimH in bladder colonization 110 . Furthermore, the anti-FimH antibodies did not seem to alter the E. coli niche in the gut microbiota 109 . Modifications of this vaccine are currently under development, with the aim of inducing greater immune stimulation 108 , 112 . For example, one approach has been to fuse FimH to the flagellin FliC in order to induce a more substantial acute inflammatory response, which functions through TLR4 signalling via the MYD88 pathway 112 . A Phase I clinical trial began in January 2014 to evaluate the efficacy of a FimC–FimH vaccine using a synthetic analogue of monophosphoryl lipid A as the adjuvant.\\nIn addition to the UPEC adhesins, adhesins from P. mirabilis and E. faecalis have also been used as vaccine targets 60 , 113 . In a mouse model of UTI, vaccination with the P. mirabilis MR/P pilus adhesin, MrpH, reduced bacterial burdens compared with those of unvaccinated controls, similar to the results observed with UPEC in the FimH vaccine trials 110 , 113 . Moreover, a vaccine strategy that is efficacious against E. faecalis CAUTIs is being developed based on vaccination with the Ebp pilus adhesin, EbpA. This strategy induced high antibody titers and reduced bacterial burdens in a mouse model of CAUTI 60 . In conclusion, adhesin-based vaccines represent a promising area for the development of therapeutics against uropathogens. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of host–pathogen interactions is crucial for vaccine development strategies. Vaccines targeting bacterial toxins and proteases\\nThe UPEC pore-forming toxin HlyA has also received attention as a potential vaccine target and was evaluated in a mouse model of pyelonephritis to assess protection against renal damage 114 , 115 . Vaccination with HlyA reduced the incidence of renal scaring compared with controls; however, it did not protect against UPEC colonization of the kidneys 115 . In addition, in a mouse model of UTI, vaccination with the P. mirabilis haemolysin, HpmA, did not provide protection against bacterial colonization 116 . However, vaccination with Pta, an alkaline protease with toxic effects towards epithelial cells, displayed promising results in a mouse model of UTI, protecting against upper UTI, although bacterial burdens in the bladder remained unaffected 116 . Thus, although haemolysins and proteases might provide effective vaccine targets for preventing upper UTIs, additional studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these enzymes as targets for vaccines. Vaccines targeting siderophores\\nIron acquisition systems have shown great promise as targets for vaccine development because uropathogens require a source of iron during colonization and persistence. Furthermore, siderophore and haem acquisition systems have been shown to be upregulated during experimental infection, as well as in the urine of women with a UTI 86 , 94 , 97 , 98 . These parameters sparked vaccine development based on ferric yersiniabactin uptake receptor (FyuA), haem acquisition protein (Hma), iron uptake transport aerobactin receptor (IutA) and the siderophore receptor iron-responsive element A (IreA) 98 . Vaccination with FyuA and Hma protected mice against pyelonephritis 98 , 117 , whereas vaccination with IutA and IreA reduced bladder colonization in mice, confirming the importance of these proteins during infection 98 , 117 . Interestingly, the differential tissue-specific protection seen with these four proteins suggests that these systems have different roles or expression profiles in different niches, including the bladder or kidneys.\\nVaccinations with other siderophore systems in mouse models of UTI, including the iron receptors FitA and ChuA 98 , were not protective against infection and were correlated, to a large extent, with lower antigen-specific humoral responses during experimental UTI. These studies suggest that effective siderophore-based vaccines function in part by preventing cognate siderophore uptake, as is the case with FyuA, Hma, IutA and IreA 98 , 117 , making this an exciting area of therapeutic development against UTIs. Small molecules targeting urease\\nSeveral urease inhibitors have been developed as potential drugs for UTI treatment, with varying results 89 . Many of the early inhibitors were active against ureases from several different bacterial species, including Helicobacter pylori, P. mirabilis and S. saprophyticus , and many of these inhibitors showed great promise, as they had low binding and inhibitory concentrations. The best characterized urease inhibitor, acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), even had some success in treating UTIs caused by urease-producing organisms; this inhibitor works by preventing urine alkalization and was approved by the FDA in 1983 (REF. 89 ). However, many of these inhibitors had severe side effects related to toxicity. For example, AHA resulted in teratogenicity, as well as psychoneurological and musculo-integumentary effects. Subsequent studies showed that derivatives of AHA also had considerable inhibitory properties, but again, these compounds had mutagenic properties that made them undesirable therapeutics 89 . Another group of urease inhibitors, the phosphoramidites, exhibited potent activity against P. mirabilis urease and were effective in a mouse model of infection. However, this class of compounds displayed low stability in the low pH of gastric juice, making them impractical 89 . Finally, the heterocyclic compounds termed benzimidazoles have garnered much attention because they function as proton pump inhibitors that irreversibly inactivate ATPase systems 118 . These compounds are currently the standard treatment for peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease 89 . Benzimidazoles interact with the gastric hydrogen potassium ATPase, thereby inactivating them and effectively limiting the disease 118 . Interestingly, benzimidazoles also bind to the urease metallocentre, effectively blocking the active site of the enzyme through steric hindrance 89 . Benzimidazoles also have a bactericidal activity against H. pylori , and this is not mediated by urease inhibition, indicating that these compounds have a more general bactericidal effect 89 , 119 . Great strides have been made to identify and characterize urease inhibitors, but more work is needed to bring these potential treatments to the market. Small molecules targeting bacterial adhesion\\nOur detailed understanding of pilus assembly and pilus–receptor binding has opened the door to the development of two classes of small, rationally designed synthetic compounds to inhibit pili: mannosides, which inhibit pilus function; and pilicides, which inhibit pilus assembly. Targeting CUP pilus function or assembly has therapeutic potential, as it should block UPEC colonization, invasion and biofilm formation, thus preventing disease 30 , 31 , 120 , 121 .\\nPilicides were originally developed to specifically inhibit the assembly of UPEC type 1 pili. They have a 2-pyridone scaffold 28 , 30 , 31 , 120 and function by selectively targeting and interfering with crucial chaperone–usher interactions. Further studies have been carried out to investigate their broad spectrum of activity against other CUP pili 122 . A recent analysis of 35 Escherichia spp. genomes and 132 plasmids identified a total of 458 CUP operons, representing 38 distinct CUP pilus types on the basis of usher phylogeny 25 . A single Escherichia sp. genome can have as many as 16 distinct, intact CUP oper-ons 25 , suggesting that compounds which target CUP pili by disrupting their assembly would potentially exhibit broad-spectrum activity. For example, pilicide ec240 was found to disrupt several virulence-associated pili, including type 1 pili, P pili and S pili, as well as flagellar motility 122 . The effect of ec240 on the transcriptome and proteome of the cystitis isolate E. coli UTI89 revealed that the most downregulated genes after growth in the presence of ec240 were the type 1 pilus genes. Type 1 pilus expression is controlled by inversion of the type 1 fimbriae promoter element ( fimS ), which can oscillate between phase ON and phase OFF orientations. ec240 induced the fimS phase OFF orientation and increased the expression of the transcriptional regulators S-fimbrial switch regulatory protein (SfaB) and P pilus regulatory protein PapB, which have been shown to promote a fimS phase OFF orientation 122 . Thus, the potency of pilicide ec240 is largely due to its ability to induce a phase OFF orientation of the type 1 pilus promoter, rather than any interference with chaperone–usher interactions. Additional work revealed that other pilicides also inhibit the production of Dr pili, another type of UPEC CUP pili that are known to be important in pyelonephritis in mice and humans 30 , 33 . Furthermore, pilicides have been shown to disrupt CUP pilus biogenesis in K. pneumoniae and also in Haemophilus influenzae (a finding that has important implications for otitis media) 24 , 29 . Thus, pilicides represent an exciting class of antivirulence molecules with the potential to target a broad spectrum of pathogens that utilize CUP pili in attachment and the establishment of infection. Future studies using mouse models of UTIs and CAUTIs to investigate the role of CUP pili in Gram-negative bacterial infections, as well as the efficacy and bioavailability of pilicides as therapeutics, will unravel the potential of this class of molecules.\\nMannosides, which are FimH receptor analogues, have been developed to bind FimH with high affinity and block FimH binding to mannosylated receptors 35 , 121 , 123 – 125 . Mannosides are potent FimH antagonists that offer a promising therapeutic opportunity for the treatment and prevention of UTIs by interrupting key host–pathogen interactions 123 – 125 . Studies in mouse models have demonstrated the potential of mannosides as novel therapeutic strategies against UTIs: mannosides are orally bioavailable; they are potent and fast-acting therapeutics in treating and preventing UTIs; they function by preventing bladder colonization and invasion; they are effective against multidrug-resistant UPEC; they potentiate antibiotic efficacy; and they are effective against established UTIs and CAUTIs 35 , 121 , 124 , 125 .\\nInterestingly, the adhesin FimH undergoes a substantial structural change during transit across the usher pore, such that the receptor-binding lectin domain bends approximately 37° with respect to the pilin domain. Thus, FimH adopts an elongated conformation before transport across the usher pore 32 , 126 , whereas the lectin domain swings closer to the pilin domain after transport 32 . The two forms of the lectin domain have important implications for binding and pathogenesis: the elongated conformation binds mannose with a significantly higher affinity than the compact form 126 . Residues that control these conformational transitions have been shown to be under positive selection, and pathoadaptive alleles of FimH have subsequently been identified 126 – 128 . Thus, we now understand how protein–protein interactions and ligand binding can regulate a dynamic conformational equilibrium in the receptor-binding domain of FimH, and this is revealing unexpected insights into UTI pathogenesis and potentiating mannoside development. This unravelling of the dynamics of how allostery governs CUP pilus assembly and function is providing valuable information about macromolecular protein assembly and virulence in Gram-negative pathogens and is spawning new ways of thinking about drug development. Outlook\\nUTIs are some of the most common bacterial infections, resulting in billions of dollars in health care costs annually 1 . Both the numerous uropathogens, which encode a wide range of virulence factors, and the spread of antimicrobial resistance threaten the only effective treatment option available — antibiotics 15 , 17 . Moreover, high rates of recurrent UTIs suggest that antibiotics are not an effective therapy for all UTIs. Intensive studies have laid the foundations for conducting translational research that can identify essential mechanisms of virulence and provide evidence to guide the development of UTI treatments and prophylactics that are optimized against uropathogens and that do not alter the normal microflora. The identification of virulence determinants — specifically, those that are essential for initial attachment, including adhesins, and for the subsequent establishment of disease, including siderophores and urease — has allowed the development of targeted therapies that effectively neutralize pathogenic bacteria and prevent disease in animal models. By targeting the initial steps of infection — either through chemical compounds, such as mannosides and pilicides, or by vaccination with adhesins or siderophore receptors — these therapies aim to prevent uropathogens from gaining a foothold in the urinary tract.\\nAlthough great strides have been made in developing new strategies that might one day be of value in the treatment and prevention of UTIs, more work is needed. Although the FimH vaccine is in Phase I clinical trials, many of the other potential therapies, including mannosides, pilicides, and vaccines against siderophores, toxins and pili, are still in the preclinical stages of development and have been tested only in animal models. Importantly, the impact of these strategies on the endogenous microbiota should be considered. For example, although these antivirulence therapeutics are not expected to greatly affect the microbiota (as Enterobacteriaceae family members make up only a small portion of the gut flora), only the FimH vaccine has so far been demonstrated to have no effect on the normal composition of the gut microbiota 109 .\\nFinally, substantial effort should be put into setting up future clinical trials, which will be essential for translating these novel antivirulence therapies into new treatments that reduce the suffering associated with UTIs.

Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra.\\n   - Women are at greater risk of developing a UTI than men due to anatomical factors.\\n\\n2. **Symptoms**:\\n   - Symptoms can include a strong urge to urinate, burning sensation during urination, frequent urination with small amounts of urine, cloudy urine, blood in urine, strong-smelling urine, and pelvic pain, especially in women.\\n   - UTIs can sometimes lead to more serious issues if the infection spreads to the kidneys.\\n\\n3. **Causes**:\\n   - UTIs typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to multiply in the bladder. The most common bacterium that causes UTIs is *Escherichia coli* (E. coli), but other bacteria such as *Klebsiella pneumoniae* and *Proteus mirabilis* can also be involved.\\n\\n4. **Risk Factors**:\\n   - Factors that may increase the risk of UTIs include being female, sexual activity, certain types of birth control (like diaphragms), menopause, urinary tract problems (like blockages), and a suppressed immune system.\\n\\n5. **Complications**:\\n   - If left untreated, UTIs can lead to severe complications such as recurrent infections, permanent kidney damage, or even sepsis.\\n\\n6. **Diagnosis**:\\n   - UTIs are diagnosed through urine tests that check for the presence of bacteria, white blood cells, and other signs of infection.\\n\\n7. **Treatment**:\\n   - The primary treatment for UTIs is antibiotics, and specific antibiotics may be used based on the type of bacteria detected in the urine. It’s essential to complete the full course of antibiotics.\\n   - Pain relief medications and drinking plenty of fluids are also recommended.\\n\\n8. **Prevention**:\\n   - Preventive measures include drinking plenty of liquids, urinating after intercourse, wiping from front to back after using the toilet, and avoiding irritants.\\n\\n9. **Emerging Concerns**:\\n   - There is a growing concern regarding antibiotic resistance among uropathogens, which poses challenges for treatment.\\n\\n10. **Future Directions**:\\n    - Research is ongoing into vaccines and new treatments that can target the mechanisms of UTI pathogenesis, including methods aimed at preventing the adherence of bacteria to the bladder wall.\\n\\nThe compiled data from articles and medical resources highlights the significance of UTIs as a common yet serious infection, emphasizing the need for proper diagnosis and treatments while also calling attention to the importance of prevention strategies and the rising concern of antibiotic resistance.\\n\\n```\\nThought: I now know the final answer\\nFinal Answer: The comprehensive information regarding Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) includes their definition, symptoms, causes, risk factors, potential complications, diagnosis, treatment, prevention strategies, emerging concerns about antibiotic resistance, and future research directions on vaccines and new therapies.

They primarily occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and proliferate, leading to infection. The most common pathogen responsible for UTIs is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which normally resides in the intestines.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of a UTI can vary widely but often include:\\n- A persistent urge to urinate\\n- Burning sensation during urination\\n- Frequent urination with minimal urine output\\n- Cloudy urine\\n- Blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n- Strong-smelling urine\\n- Pelvic pain in women\\nSymptoms can differ based on whether the infection affects the bladder (cystitis) or the kidneys (pyelonephritis), with kidney infections often presenting more severe symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting.\\n\\n## Causes\\nUTIs occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract, typically through the urethra. Most commonly, E. coli causes these infections, particularly from the gastrointestinal tract. Other bacteria, fungi, or even viruses can also lead to UTIs. Factors including sexual activity, improper hygiene, and anatomical differences (e.g., shorter urethras in women) can increase susceptibility.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nSeveral risk factors make certain individuals more prone to UTIs:\\n- **Female Anatomy**: Women have a shorter urethra, decreasing the distance for bacteria to travel to the bladder.\\n- **Sexual Activity**: Increased sexual activity can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract.\\n- **Certain Birth Control**: Diaphragms and spermicidal agents may elevate the likelihood of infections.\\n- **Menopause**: Hormonal changes can affect urinary tract health.\\n- **Medical Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or the use of urinary catheters can compromise immune defenses and increase risk. \\n\\n## Complications\\nComplications arising from untreated UTIs can be serious and include:\\n- Recurrent infections\\n- Permanent kidney damage\\n- Increased risk of premature labor or low birth weight in pregnant women\\n- Urethral narrowing in men\\n- Sepsis, a potentially life-threatening systemic infection.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nHealthcare providers diagnose UTIs by considering symptoms and conducting tests such as:\\n- **Urinalysis**: Examining urine samples for bacteria, signs of inflammation, and blood.\\n- **Urine Culture**: Culturing urine samples to identify specific pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivities.\\nAdvanced imaging like ultrasounds or CT scans may be used in complicated cases to assess the structure of the urinary tract.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nUTIs are generally treated with antibiotics. Common medications include:\\n- Nitrofurantoin\\n- Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim\\n- Amoxicillin\\n- Fluroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin)\\nPatients are advised to complete the prescribed course of antibiotics to prevent recurrence and resistance. For recurrent UTIs, continuous low-dose antibiotics as a preventive measure may be considered.\\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\nTo reduce the risk of UTIs, the following preventive measures are recommended:\\n- **Hydration**: Drinking ample water to dilute urine and help flush out bacteria.\\n- **Hygiene Practices**: Wiping from front to back, using mild products, and urinating soon after sexual activity.\\n- **Dietary Changes**: Consider cranberry products or probiotics, which may help maintain urinary tract health.\\n- **Birth Control Methods**: Discuss alternatives to actions like diaphragms that may increase UTI risk with healthcare providers.\\n\\n## Antibiotic Resistance\\nEmerging concerns around antibiotic resistance highlight the importance of appropriate antibiotic use. Over-treatment can lead to resistant strains of bacteria that complicate treatment, necessitating ongoing developments in both preventive measures and new therapeutic strategies.\\n\\n## Future Research Directions\\nThere is ongoing research into the development of vaccines and novel therapies for UTIs. Potential studies are exploring promising avenues, such as:\\n- Vaccine development targeting uropathogenic E. coli\\n- New antibiotic compounds with better efficacy and reduced resistance potential.\\n- Investigating the role of the microbiome in preventing infections.\\n\\nIn summary, while urinary tract infections are common and often easily treatable, significant health implications arise from recurrent infections and inadequate management, accentuating the necessity for effective prevention and treatment strategies within healthcare systems.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_2", "context": {"span_id": "0x89e46fa7158265fc", "trace_id": "0xdd0f01cbf6fd68f901768d318bcb5d90"}, "parent_id": "0x8cc4bd41d997dfc6", "start_time": 1742647447004248851, "end_time": 1742647476830324529, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"4772363b999f4796b50fbd0355bfcab9\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"The comprehensive information regarding Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) includes their definition, symptoms, causes, risk factors, potential complications, diagnosis, treatment, prevention strategies, emerging concerns about antibiotic resistance, and future research directions on vaccines and new therapies.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days.

Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine. The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper stomach area. They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine. Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

They primarily occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and proliferate, leading to infection. The most common pathogen responsible for UTIs is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which normally resides in the intestines.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of a UTI can vary widely but often include:\\n- A persistent urge to urinate\\n- Burning sensation during urination\\n- Frequent urination with minimal urine output\\n- Cloudy urine\\n- Blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n- Strong-smelling urine\\n- Pelvic pain in women\\nSymptoms can differ based on whether the infection affects the bladder (cystitis) or the kidneys (pyelonephritis), with kidney infections often presenting more severe symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting.\\n\\n## Causes\\nUTIs occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract, typically through the urethra. Most commonly, E. coli causes these infections, particularly from the gastrointestinal tract. Other bacteria, fungi, or even viruses can also lead to UTIs. Factors including sexual activity, improper hygiene, and anatomical differences (e.g., shorter urethras in women) can increase susceptibility.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nSeveral risk factors make certain individuals more prone to UTIs:\\n- **Female Anatomy**: Women have a shorter urethra, decreasing the distance for bacteria to travel to the bladder.\\n- **Sexual Activity**: Increased sexual activity can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract.\\n- **Certain Birth Control**: Diaphragms and spermicidal agents may elevate the likelihood of infections.\\n- **Menopause**: Hormonal changes can affect urinary tract health.\\n- **Medical Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or the use of urinary catheters can compromise immune defenses and increase risk. \\n\\n## Complications\\nComplications arising from untreated UTIs can be serious and include:\\n- Recurrent infections\\n- Permanent kidney damage\\n- Increased risk of premature labor or low birth weight in pregnant women\\n- Urethral narrowing in men\\n- Sepsis, a potentially life-threatening systemic infection.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nHealthcare providers diagnose UTIs by considering symptoms and conducting tests such as:\\n- **Urinalysis**: Examining urine samples for bacteria, signs of inflammation, and blood.\\n- **Urine Culture**: Culturing urine samples to identify specific pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivities.\\nAdvanced imaging like ultrasounds or CT scans may be used in complicated cases to assess the structure of the urinary tract.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nUTIs are generally treated with antibiotics.

They typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and multiply, leading to infection. The most common bacteria causing UTIs is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which usually lives in the intestines.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of a UTI can vary, but they often include:\\n- A strong, persistent urge to urinate\\n- Burning sensation during urination\\n- Frequent urination with little urine produced\\n- Cloudy or unusual-smelling urine\\n- Blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n- Pelvic pain in women\\n- Symptoms may differ based on the location of the infection:\\n  - **Bladder infection (cystitis)** may cause mild symptoms.\\n  - **Kidney infection (pyelonephritis)** usually presents more severe symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting.\\n\\n## Causes\\nUTIs develop when bacteria enter the urinary system, often through the urethra. E. coli is the main culprit, usually coming from the intestines. Other germs, such as different bacteria, fungi, or viruses, can also cause UTIs. Factors that can increase the risk include:\\n- Sexual activity\\n- Poor hygiene\\n- Anatomical factors, such as shorter urethras in women\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors can make individuals more prone to UTIs:\\n- **Female Anatomy**: Women have shorter urethras, reducing the distance for germs to reach the bladder.\\n- **Sexual Activity**: Increased sexual activity may introduce bacteria.\\n- **Certain Birth Control Methods**: Diaphragms and spermicides can increase the risk.\\n- **Menopause**: Hormonal changes may affect urinary tract health.\\n- **Medical Conditions**: Diseases like diabetes or using urinary catheters can weaken the immune system.\\n\\n## Complications\\nUntreated UTIs can lead to serious complications, including:\\n- Recurrent infections\\n- Permanent kidney damage\\n- Increased risk of premature birth or low birth weight in pregnant women\\n- Urethral narrowing in men\\n- Sepsis, a serious and potentially life-threatening infection.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nHealthcare providers diagnose UTIs by evaluating symptoms and conducting tests, such as:\\n- **Urinalysis**: Checking urine samples for germs, signs of inflammation, and blood.\\n- **Urine Culture**: Growing urine samples in a lab to identify specific germs and their response to antibiotics.\\nIn complex cases, imaging techniques like ultrasounds or CT scans might be used to view the urinary system.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nUTIs are usually treated with antibiotics. Common medications include:\\n- Nitrofurantoin\\n- Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim\\n- Amoxicillin\\n- Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin)\\nPatients should complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent a return of the infection and resist bacteria. For frequent UTIs, doctors may recommend low-dose antibiotics as a preventive measure.\\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\nTo minimize the risk of UTIs, consider these preventive measures:\\n- **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water helps dilute urine and flush out germs.\\n- **Good Hygiene**: Wipe from front to back, use gentle cleansers, and urinate soon after sex.\\n- **Dietary Changes**: Consuming cranberry products or probiotics may support urinary tract health.\\n- **Discuss Birth Control**: Talk with healthcare providers about safer birth control options.\\n\\n## Antibiotic Resistance\\nConcerns around antibiotic resistance emphasize the need for responsible antibiotic use.

They primarily occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and proliferate, leading to infection. The most common pathogen responsible for UTIs is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which normally resides in the intestines.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of a UTI can vary widely but often include:\\n- A persistent urge to urinate\\n- Burning sensation during urination\\n- Frequent urination with minimal urine output\\n- Cloudy urine\\n- Blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n- Strong-smelling urine\\n- Pelvic pain in women\\nSymptoms can differ based on whether the infection affects the bladder (cystitis) or the kidneys (pyelonephritis), with kidney infections often presenting more severe symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting.\\n\\n## Causes\\nUTIs occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract, typically through the urethra. Most commonly, E. coli causes these infections, particularly from the gastrointestinal tract. Other bacteria, fungi, or even viruses can also lead to UTIs. Factors including sexual activity, improper hygiene, and anatomical differences (e.g., shorter urethras in women) can increase susceptibility.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nSeveral risk factors make certain individuals more prone to UTIs:\\n- **Female Anatomy**: Women have a shorter urethra, decreasing the distance for bacteria to travel to the bladder.\\n- **Sexual Activity**: Increased sexual activity can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract.\\n- **Certain Birth Control**: Diaphragms and spermicidal agents may elevate the likelihood of infections.\\n- **Menopause**: Hormonal changes can affect urinary tract health.\\n- **Medical Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or the use of urinary catheters can compromise immune defenses and increase risk. \\n\\n## Complications\\nComplications arising from untreated UTIs can be serious and include:\\n- Recurrent infections\\n- Permanent kidney damage\\n- Increased risk of premature labor or low birth weight in pregnant women\\n- Urethral narrowing in men\\n- Sepsis, a potentially life-threatening systemic infection.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nHealthcare providers diagnose UTIs by considering symptoms and conducting tests such as:\\n- **Urinalysis**: Examining urine samples for bacteria, signs of inflammation, and blood.\\n- **Urine Culture**: Culturing urine samples to identify specific pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivities.\\nAdvanced imaging like ultrasounds or CT scans may be used in complicated cases to assess the structure of the urinary tract.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nUTIs are generally treated with antibiotics. Common medications include:\\n- Nitrofurantoin\\n- Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim\\n- Amoxicillin\\n- Fluroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin)\\nPatients are advised to complete the prescribed course of antibiotics to prevent recurrence and resistance. For recurrent UTIs, continuous low-dose antibiotics as a preventive measure may be considered.\\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\nTo reduce the risk of UTIs, the following preventive measures are recommended:\\n- **Hydration**: Drinking ample water to dilute urine and help flush out bacteria.\\n- **Hygiene Practices**: Wiping from front to back, using mild products, and urinating soon after sexual activity.\\n- **Dietary Changes**: Consider cranberry products or probiotics, which may help maintain urinary tract health.\\n- **Birth Control Methods**: Discuss alternatives to actions like diaphragms that may increase UTI risk with healthcare providers.\\n\\n## Antibiotic Resistance\\nEmerging concerns around antibiotic resistance highlight the importance of appropriate antibiotic use. Over-treatment can lead to resistant strains of bacteria that complicate treatment, necessitating ongoing developments in both preventive measures and new therapeutic strategies.\\n\\n## Future Research Directions\\nThere is ongoing research into the development of vaccines and novel therapies for UTIs. Potential studies are exploring promising avenues, such as:\\n- Vaccine development targeting uropathogenic E. coli\\n- New antibiotic compounds with better efficacy and reduced resistance potential.\\n- Investigating the role of the microbiome in preventing infections.\\n\\nIn summary, while urinary tract infections are common and often easily treatable, significant health implications arise from recurrent infections and inadequate management, accentuating the necessity for effective prevention and treatment strategies within healthcare systems.\", \"tools\": []}", "id": "\"7de9f035-b231-46a9-9e6d-2307d39d1c88\"", "formatting_errors": "\"0\"", "role": "\"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Senior Summarizer\\n\"", "goal": "\"Generate a summary with the most important information about Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)\\n\"", "backstory": "\"You're a report writer who organizes incoming information well, creates concise texts and translates from technical terms to more common ones.

They primarily occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and proliferate, leading to infection. The most common pathogen responsible for UTIs is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which normally resides in the intestines.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of a UTI can vary widely but often include:\\n- A persistent urge to urinate\\n- Burning sensation during urination\\n- Frequent urination with minimal urine output\\n- Cloudy urine\\n- Blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n- Strong-smelling urine\\n- Pelvic pain in women\\nSymptoms can differ based on whether the infection affects the bladder (cystitis) or the kidneys (pyelonephritis), with kidney infections often presenting more severe symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting.\\n\\n## Causes\\nUTIs occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract, typically through the urethra. Most commonly, E. coli causes these infections, particularly from the gastrointestinal tract. Other bacteria, fungi, or even viruses can also lead to UTIs. Factors including sexual activity, improper hygiene, and anatomical differences (e.g., shorter urethras in women) can increase susceptibility.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nSeveral risk factors make certain individuals more prone to UTIs:\\n- **Female Anatomy**: Women have a shorter urethra, decreasing the distance for bacteria to travel to the bladder.\\n- **Sexual Activity**: Increased sexual activity can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract.\\n- **Certain Birth Control**: Diaphragms and spermicidal agents may elevate the likelihood of infections.\\n- **Menopause**: Hormonal changes can affect urinary tract health.\\n- **Medical Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or the use of urinary catheters can compromise immune defenses and increase risk. \\n\\n## Complications\\nComplications arising from untreated UTIs can be serious and include:\\n- Recurrent infections\\n- Permanent kidney damage\\n- Increased risk of premature labor or low birth weight in pregnant women\\n- Urethral narrowing in men\\n- Sepsis, a potentially life-threatening systemic infection.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nHealthcare providers diagnose UTIs by considering symptoms and conducting tests such as:\\n- **Urinalysis**: Examining urine samples for bacteria, signs of inflammation, and blood.\\n- **Urine Culture**: Culturing urine samples to identify specific pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivities.\\nAdvanced imaging like ultrasounds or CT scans may be used in complicated cases to assess the structure of the urinary tract.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nUTIs are generally treated with antibiotics. Common medications include:\\n- Nitrofurantoin\\n- Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim\\n- Amoxicillin\\n- Fluroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin)\\nPatients are advised to complete the prescribed course of antibiotics to prevent recurrence and resistance. For recurrent UTIs, continuous low-dose antibiotics as a preventive measure may be considered.\\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\nTo reduce the risk of UTIs, the following preventive measures are recommended:\\n- **Hydration**: Drinking ample water to dilute urine and help flush out bacteria.\\n- **Hygiene Practices**: Wiping from front to back, using mild products, and urinating soon after sexual activity.\\n- **Dietary Changes**: Consider cranberry products or probiotics, which may help maintain urinary tract health.\\n- **Birth Control Methods**: Discuss alternatives to actions like diaphragms that may increase UTI risk with healthcare providers.\\n\\n## Antibiotic Resistance\\nEmerging concerns around antibiotic resistance highlight the importance of appropriate antibiotic use. Over-treatment can lead to resistant strains of bacteria that complicate treatment, necessitating ongoing developments in both preventive measures and new therapeutic strategies.\\n\\n## Future Research Directions\\nThere is ongoing research into the development of vaccines and novel therapies for UTIs. Potential studies are exploring promising avenues, such as:\\n- Vaccine development targeting uropathogenic E. coli\\n- New antibiotic compounds with better efficacy and reduced resistance potential.\\n- Investigating the role of the microbiome in preventing infections.\\n\\nIn summary, while urinary tract infections are common and often easily treatable, significant health implications arise from recurrent infections and inadequate management, accentuating the necessity for effective prevention and treatment strategies within healthcare systems.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}, {\"description\": \"Using the information received, write a report, translating very technical terms into more common language.

Overview\\nThe common cold is a viral infection that mainly affects the upper parts of the respiratory system, particularly the nose and throat. There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds are more frequent during the colder months because people tend to stay indoors, which helps the viruses spread. Generally, a cold lasts for less than a week, although individual experiences may vary.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe first signs of a cold usually include:\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny nose\\n- Coughing\\n- Sneezing\\n- General feeling of being unwell\\n\\nThese symptoms typically intensify within 2 to 3 days after exposure to the virus. As the cold develops, other symptoms may appear, such as:\\n- Body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Low-grade fever\\n- Nasal congestion\\n\\nMost symptoms begin to improve within 7 to 10 days, but they can linger longer in smokers or those with other health conditions.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and spread easily from person to person. The common ways they are transmitted include:\\n- **Respiratory droplets**: When a sick person coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the virus are released into the air.\\n- **Surface contact**: The virus can survive on surfaces for some time. If someone touches a contaminated surface and then touches their face, they can become infected.\\n\\nCrowded places, like schools and public transportation, increase the likelihood of catching a cold.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors can make individuals more likely to catch a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are often more at risk due to their developing immune systems.\\n- **Health status**: Individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic health issues are also more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle choices**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can negatively impact respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Being in crowded or close quarters can lead to easier viral transmission.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nWhile most colds are mild, they can sometimes lead to more serious complications, including:\\n- **Middle ear infections**: More common in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: This is an inflammation of the sinuses that can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Asthma attacks**: People with asthma may experience worsening of their symptoms.\\n- **Serious respiratory illnesses**: In rare cases, colds can lead to severe health issues, especially among vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nTo reduce the risk of catching or spreading a cold, consider these preventive measures:\\n- **Hand washing**: Wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer when soap is not available.\\n- **Avoid close contact**: Steer clear of sick individuals to minimize the chance of transmission.\\n- **Cleaning surfaces**: Regularly disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs and light switches.\\n- **Healthy living**: Maintain a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly to help strengthen the immune system.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no specific cure for the common cold. However, relief from symptoms can often be achieved with over-the-counter medications, such as:\\n- **Pain relievers**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce pain and fever.\\n- **Decongestants**: These medications can alleviate nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines and cough suppressants**: These can help relieve throat irritation and cough.\\n\\nAlways consult a healthcare provider before giving any medications to children.\\n\\n## 8.

This disease is known for its sudden onset of symptoms and can lead to severe health complications if not treated effectively. It's important to understand the nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context of influenza to minimize its effects on public health.\\n\\n## Types of Influenza Viruses\\nInfluenza viruses are categorized into four main types:\\n\\n1. **Influenza A**: This is the most widespread type of influenza virus responsible for causing seasonal outbreaks and pandemics. It can infect various animals, including birds and pigs, as well as humans. Influenza A is often associated with the most severe illness during flu seasons.\\n\\n2. **Influenza B**: Predominantly found in humans, this type causes seasonal outbreaks but does not lead to widespread pandemics. Vaccines targeting influenza B are included in the annual flu vaccination.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: This type causes mild respiratory infections and is less frequent than types A and B. It does not typically lead to significant outbreaks or severe health issues.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: Mainly affects cattle and does not pose a direct threat to human health, as it rarely infects people.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can survive on surfaces, making it possible for individuals to become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their faces.

Overview\\nThe common cold is a viral infection that mainly affects the upper parts of the respiratory system, particularly the nose and throat. There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds are more frequent during the colder months because people tend to stay indoors, which helps the viruses spread. Generally, a cold lasts for less than a week, although individual experiences may vary.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe first signs of a cold usually include:\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny nose\\n- Coughing\\n- Sneezing\\n- General feeling of being unwell\\n\\nThese symptoms typically intensify within 2 to 3 days after exposure to the virus. As the cold develops, other symptoms may appear, such as:\\n- Body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Low-grade fever\\n- Nasal congestion\\n\\nMost symptoms begin to improve within 7 to 10 days, but they can linger longer in smokers or those with other health conditions.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and spread easily from person to person. The common ways they are transmitted include:\\n- **Respiratory droplets**: When a sick person coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the virus are released into the air.\\n- **Surface contact**: The virus can survive on surfaces for some time. If someone touches a contaminated surface and then touches their face, they can become infected.\\n\\nCrowded places, like schools and public transportation, increase the likelihood of catching a cold.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors can make individuals more likely to catch a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are often more at risk due to their developing immune systems.\\n- **Health status**: Individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic health issues are also more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle choices**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can negatively impact respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Being in crowded or close quarters can lead to easier viral transmission.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nWhile most colds are mild, they can sometimes lead to more serious complications, including:\\n- **Middle ear infections**: More common in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: This is an inflammation of the sinuses that can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Asthma attacks**: People with asthma may experience worsening of their symptoms.\\n- **Serious respiratory illnesses**: In rare cases, colds can lead to severe health issues, especially among vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nTo reduce the risk of catching or spreading a cold, consider these preventive measures:\\n- **Hand washing**: Wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer when soap is not available.\\n- **Avoid close contact**: Steer clear of sick individuals to minimize the chance of transmission.\\n- **Cleaning surfaces**: Regularly disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs and light switches.\\n- **Healthy living**: Maintain a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly to help strengthen the immune system.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no specific cure for the common cold. However, relief from symptoms can often be achieved with over-the-counter medications, such as:\\n- **Pain relievers**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce pain and fever.\\n- **Decongestants**: These medications can alleviate nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines and cough suppressants**: These can help relieve throat irritation and cough.\\n\\nAlways consult a healthcare provider before giving any medications to children.\\n\\n## 8. When to Seek Medical Care\\nIf symptoms worsen or do not improve after 7 to 10 days, or if more severe symptoms such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain occur, it is important to seek medical help as there may be a need to rule out more serious conditions.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, consider checking these resources:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"tasks_output\": [{\"description\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Common Cold Make sure you find any relevant information of renowned sources.\\n\", \"name\": \"research_task\", \"expected_output\": \"A set of relevant information about Common Cold\\n\", \"summary\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Common Cold Make sure you...\", \"raw\": \"1. **Overview**: The common cold is a viral infection affecting the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat).

Colds are particularly prevalent during colder months, with incidence rates increasing as people congregate indoors. The typical duration of a cold is less than a week, although the length can vary based on individual immunity and health.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe onset of a cold is marked by early symptoms such as a sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and general malaise. These symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days post-infection. As the cold progresses, additional symptoms may arise, including body aches, headaches, low-grade fevers, and nasal congestion. Most cold symptoms start to improve within 7 to 10 days, although some may persist longer in individuals who smoke.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nThe common cold is highly contagious. It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Additionally, it can be transmitted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus followed by touching one’s face. This mode of transmission is especially prominent in crowded settings like schools, public transport, and gatherings.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors increase the risk of contracting a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are at a higher risk due to their still-developing immune systems.\\n- **Immune System**: Individuals with weakened immune systems owing to underlying health issues are more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke exacerbate risk by impairing respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Crowded locations enhance virus transmission likelihood, particularly in schools and public transport systems.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nAlthough the common cold is generally mild, it can lead to several complications, including:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation of the sinuses can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Exacerbation of Asthma**: Individuals with asthma may experience worsened symptoms.\\n- **Severe Respiratory Diseases**: In rare cases, colds can lead to more severe conditions, especially in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nPreventive measures include:\\n- **Hand Hygiene**: Regularly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizers are effective when soap is unavailable.\\n- **Avoiding Contact**: Keeping distance from individuals who are symptomatic can reduce transmission risk.\\n- **Disinfection**: Regular cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces to eliminate viral presence.\\n- **Healthy Lifestyle**: A balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and regular exercise can fortify the immune system against infections.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no specific cure for the common cold. Relief from symptoms can be achieved through over-the-counter medications such as:\\n- **Pain Relievers**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for headaches and body aches.\\n- **Decongestants**: To alleviate nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines and Cough Suppressants**: To help manage throat irritation and coughing.\\n\\nConsultation with a healthcare provider is crucial before administering any medications to children.\\n\\n## 8.

When to Seek Medical Care\\nIf symptoms worsen or do not improve after 7 to 10 days, or if more severe symptoms such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain occur, it is important to seek medical help as there may be a need to rule out more serious conditions.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, consider checking these resources:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Common Cold Senior Summarizer\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}], \"token_usage\": {\"total_tokens\": 35191, \"prompt_tokens\": 32512, \"cached_prompt_tokens\": 11648, \"completion_tokens\": 2679, \"successful_requests\": 8}}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Task.execute_sync_1", "context": {"span_id": "0x0b995c935a9b6250", "trace_id": "0xa7c6aa73de334f6444959be0753e6633"}, "parent_id": "0x6f0df02e0e80a9ca", "start_time": 1742646493266680620, "end_time": 1742646534970415675, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"896af6ca7ee342eeab388b3e10b9873c\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"CHAIN\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"\", \"tools\": [{\"name\": \"Search the internet with Serper\", \"description\": \"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

It is caused by more than 200 types of viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds occur frequently, especially during the colder months, and usually last less than a week.\\n \\n2. **Symptoms**: \\n   - Early symptoms include a sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and general malaise.\\n   - Symptoms typically peak 2 to 3 days after infection and may include body aches, headache, low-grade fever, and nasal congestion.\\n   - Cold symptoms usually improve within 7 to 10 days but may linger, especially in smokers.\\n\\n3. **Transmission**: Colds are highly contagious and spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. They can also be transmitted via hand contact with contaminated surfaces and touching the face.\\n\\n4. **Risk Factors**: \\n   - Age (young children have a higher chance due to their developing immune systems).\\n   - Weakened immune system due to underlying health issues.\\n   - Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.\\n   - Crowded places, such as schools and public transport.\\n\\n5. **Complications**: While usually mild, colds can lead to complications such as middle ear infections, sinusitis, asthma exacerbations, and in some cases, more severe respiratory diseases.\\n\\n6. **Prevention**: \\n   - Practice good hand hygiene, regularly wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and use hand sanitizers when necessary.\\n   - Avoid close contact with sick individuals, clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and cover coughs and sneezes.\\n   - Maintain a healthy lifestyle with adequate sleep, nutrition, and exercise to strengthen the immune system.\\n\\n7. **Treatment**: There is no specific cure for the common cold. Symptomatic relief can be provided through over-the-counter medications like pain relievers (acetaminophen or ibuprofen), decongestants, antihistamines, and cough suppressants.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Infants and young children may have colds more often.\\nMost people recover from a common cold in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. If symptoms don't get better or if they get worse, see your health care provider.\\nIllnesses of the nose and throat caused by germs are called upper respiratory tract infections.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms Most often, common cold symptoms start 1 to 3 days after someone is exposed to a cold virus.

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.\\nA cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by:\\nDroplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.\\nHand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.\\nSharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.\\nTouching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.\\nRisk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:\\nAge. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\\nCover your cough. Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.\\nDon't share. Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.\\nStay away from people with colds. Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.\\nReview your child care center's policies. Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.\\nTake care of yourself. Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nMay 24, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nAAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Colds spread easily, especially within homes, classrooms and workplaces. More than 200 different viruses can cause colds.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:\\nRunny nose or nasal congestion\\nCough\\nSneezing\\nSore throat\\nHeadache\\nMild body aches\\nFever (usually low grade in older children and adults)\\nComplications\\nComplications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:\\nMild to moderate:\\nMiddle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)\\nSinus infections\\nPotentially severe:\\nAsthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)\\nBronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)\\nBronchitis (infection of the large airways)\\nPneumonia (infection of the lungs)\\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)\\nSome respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness . This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.\\nCauses and spread\\nCauses\\nMore than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses , adenoviruses , enteroviruses (including EV-D68 ), and human metapneumovirus .\\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested , especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.\\nSpread\\nDifferent respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.\\nA cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by:\\nDroplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.\\nHand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.\\nSharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.\\nTouching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.\\nRisk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:\\nAge. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\\nCover your cough. Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.\\nDon't share. Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.\\nStay away from people with colds. Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.\\nReview your child care center's policies. Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.\\nTake care of yourself. Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nMay 24, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nAAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:\\nRunny nose or nasal congestion\\nCough\\nSneezing\\nSore throat\\nHeadache\\nMild body aches\\nFever (usually low grade in older children and adults)\\nComplications\\nComplications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:\\nMild to moderate:\\nMiddle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)\\nSinus infections\\nPotentially severe:\\nAsthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)\\nBronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)\\nBronchitis (infection of the large airways)\\nPneumonia (infection of the lungs)\\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)\\nSome respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness . This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.\\nCauses and spread\\nCauses\\nMore than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses , adenoviruses , enteroviruses (including EV-D68 ), and human metapneumovirus .\\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested , especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.\\nSpread\\nDifferent respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.\\nYou can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.\\nTip‎\\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others.

It is caused by more than 200 types of viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds occur frequently, especially during the colder months, and usually last less than a week.\\n \\n2. **Symptoms**: \\n   - Early symptoms include a sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and general malaise.\\n   - Symptoms typically peak 2 to 3 days after infection and may include body aches, headache, low-grade fever, and nasal congestion.\\n   - Cold symptoms usually improve within 7 to 10 days but may linger, especially in smokers.\\n\\n3. **Transmission**: Colds are highly contagious and spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. They can also be transmitted via hand contact with contaminated surfaces and touching the face.\\n\\n4. **Risk Factors**: \\n   - Age (young children have a higher chance due to their developing immune systems).\\n   - Weakened immune system due to underlying health issues.\\n   - Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.\\n   - Crowded places, such as schools and public transport.\\n\\n5. **Complications**: While usually mild, colds can lead to complications such as middle ear infections, sinusitis, asthma exacerbations, and in some cases, more severe respiratory diseases.\\n\\n6. **Prevention**: \\n   - Practice good hand hygiene, regularly wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and use hand sanitizers when necessary.\\n   - Avoid close contact with sick individuals, clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and cover coughs and sneezes.\\n   - Maintain a healthy lifestyle with adequate sleep, nutrition, and exercise to strengthen the immune system.\\n\\n7. **Treatment**: There is no specific cure for the common cold. Symptomatic relief can be provided through over-the-counter medications like pain relievers (acetaminophen or ibuprofen), decongestants, antihistamines, and cough suppressants. It's essential to consult a healthcare provider before giving medications to children. \\n\\n8. **When to Seek Medical Care**: If symptoms worsen or don't improve after 7-10 days, or if severe symptoms like high fever, shortness of breath, or intense pain occur, one should seek medical attention.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, refer to the sources: [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold) and [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605), and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html).\\n\\n```\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"I have now gathered comprehensive information from the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and the CDC on the Common Cold.

Overview\\nThe common cold is primarily a viral infection that targets the upper respiratory tract, specifically the nose and throat. It is caused by a wide range of viruses, with over 200 types identified, the most notable being rhinoviruses. Colds are particularly prevalent during colder months, with incidence rates increasing as people congregate indoors. The typical duration of a cold is less than a week, although the length can vary based on individual immunity and health.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe onset of a cold is marked by early symptoms such as a sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and general malaise. These symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days post-infection. As the cold progresses, additional symptoms may arise, including body aches, headaches, low-grade fevers, and nasal congestion. Most cold symptoms start to improve within 7 to 10 days, although some may persist longer in individuals who smoke.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nThe common cold is highly contagious. It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Additionally, it can be transmitted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus followed by touching one’s face. This mode of transmission is especially prominent in crowded settings like schools, public transport, and gatherings.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors increase the risk of contracting a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are at a higher risk due to their still-developing immune systems.\\n- **Immune System**: Individuals with weakened immune systems owing to underlying health issues are more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke exacerbate risk by impairing respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Crowded locations enhance virus transmission likelihood, particularly in schools and public transport systems.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nAlthough the common cold is generally mild, it can lead to several complications, including:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation of the sinuses can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Exacerbation of Asthma**: Individuals with asthma may experience worsened symptoms.\\n- **Severe Respiratory Diseases**: In rare cases, colds can lead to more severe conditions, especially in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nPreventive measures include:\\n- **Hand Hygiene**: Regularly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizers are effective when soap is unavailable.\\n- **Avoiding Contact**: Keeping distance from individuals who are symptomatic can reduce transmission risk.\\n- **Disinfection**: Regular cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces to eliminate viral presence.\\n- **Healthy Lifestyle**: A balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and regular exercise can fortify the immune system against infections.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no specific cure for the common cold. Relief from symptoms can be achieved through over-the-counter medications such as:\\n- **Pain Relievers**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for headaches and body aches.\\n- **Decongestants**: To alleviate nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines and Cough Suppressants**: To help manage throat irritation and coughing.\\n\\nConsultation with a healthcare provider is crucial before administering any medications to children.\\n\\n## 8. When to Seek Medical Care\\nIndividuals should seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or do not improve after a period of 7 to 10 days. Additionally, high fever, shortness of breath, or severe pain should prompt immediate medical consultation to rule out more serious conditions.\\n\\nFor further details, consider visiting the following resources:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Common Cold Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_2", "context": {"span_id": "0x94b33e2a0c0f7c8c", "trace_id": "0xa7c6aa73de334f6444959be0753e6633"}, "parent_id": "0x83e69f25e7bac982", "start_time": 1742646534985271287, "end_time": 1742646548268863249, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"896af6ca7ee342eeab388b3e10b9873c\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"1. **Overview**: The common cold is a viral infection affecting the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat).

Overview\\nThe common cold is primarily a viral infection that targets the upper respiratory tract, specifically the nose and throat. It is caused by a wide range of viruses, with over 200 types identified, the most notable being rhinoviruses. Colds are particularly prevalent during colder months, with incidence rates increasing as people congregate indoors. The typical duration of a cold is less than a week, although the length can vary based on individual immunity and health.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe onset of a cold is marked by early symptoms such as a sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and general malaise. These symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days post-infection. As the cold progresses, additional symptoms may arise, including body aches, headaches, low-grade fevers, and nasal congestion. Most cold symptoms start to improve within 7 to 10 days, although some may persist longer in individuals who smoke.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nThe common cold is highly contagious. It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Additionally, it can be transmitted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus followed by touching one’s face. This mode of transmission is especially prominent in crowded settings like schools, public transport, and gatherings.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors increase the risk of contracting a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are at a higher risk due to their still-developing immune systems.\\n- **Immune System**: Individuals with weakened immune systems owing to underlying health issues are more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke exacerbate risk by impairing respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Crowded locations enhance virus transmission likelihood, particularly in schools and public transport systems.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nAlthough the common cold is generally mild, it can lead to several complications, including:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation of the sinuses can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Exacerbation of Asthma**: Individuals with asthma may experience worsened symptoms.\\n- **Severe Respiratory Diseases**: In rare cases, colds can lead to more severe conditions, especially in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nPreventive measures include:\\n- **Hand Hygiene**: Regularly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizers are effective when soap is unavailable.\\n- **Avoiding Contact**: Keeping distance from individuals who are symptomatic can reduce transmission risk.\\n- **Disinfection**: Regular cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces to eliminate viral presence.\\n- **Healthy Lifestyle**: A balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and regular exercise can fortify the immune system against infections.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no specific cure for the common cold. Relief from symptoms can be achieved through over-the-counter medications such as:\\n- **Pain Relievers**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for headaches and body aches.\\n- **Decongestants**: To alleviate nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines and Cough Suppressants**: To help manage throat irritation and coughing.\\n\\nConsultation with a healthcare provider is crucial before administering any medications to children.\\n\\n## 8. When to Seek Medical Care\\nIndividuals should seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or do not improve after a period of 7 to 10 days. Additionally, high fever, shortness of breath, or severe pain should prompt immediate medical consultation to rule out more serious conditions.\\n\\nFor further details, consider visiting the following resources:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n```\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"```\\nThought: I now have sufficient information to create a detailed report on the common cold.\\nFinal Answer:\\n\\n# Report on the Common Cold\\n\\n## 1.

Overview\\nThe common cold is primarily a viral infection that targets the upper respiratory tract, specifically the nose and throat. It is caused by a wide range of viruses, with over 200 types identified, the most notable being rhinoviruses. Colds are particularly prevalent during colder months, with incidence rates increasing as people congregate indoors. The typical duration of a cold is less than a week, although the length can vary based on individual immunity and health.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe onset of a cold is marked by early symptoms such as a sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and general malaise. These symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days post-infection. As the cold progresses, additional symptoms may arise, including body aches, headaches, low-grade fevers, and nasal congestion. Most cold symptoms start to improve within 7 to 10 days, although some may persist longer in individuals who smoke.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nThe common cold is highly contagious. It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Additionally, it can be transmitted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus followed by touching one’s face. This mode of transmission is especially prominent in crowded settings like schools, public transport, and gatherings.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors increase the risk of contracting a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are at a higher risk due to their still-developing immune systems.\\n- **Immune System**: Individuals with weakened immune systems owing to underlying health issues are more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke exacerbate risk by impairing respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Crowded locations enhance virus transmission likelihood, particularly in schools and public transport systems.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nAlthough the common cold is generally mild, it can lead to several complications, including:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation of the sinuses can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Exacerbation of Asthma**: Individuals with asthma may experience worsened symptoms.\\n- **Severe Respiratory Diseases**: In rare cases, colds can lead to more severe conditions, especially in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nPreventive measures include:\\n- **Hand Hygiene**: Regularly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizers are effective when soap is unavailable.\\n- **Avoiding Contact**: Keeping distance from individuals who are symptomatic can reduce transmission risk.\\n- **Disinfection**: Regular cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces to eliminate viral presence.\\n- **Healthy Lifestyle**: A balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and regular exercise can fortify the immune system against infections.\\n\\n## 7.

Overview\\nThe common cold is a viral infection that mainly affects the upper parts of the respiratory system, particularly the nose and throat. There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds are more frequent during the colder months because people tend to stay indoors, which helps the viruses spread. Generally, a cold lasts for less than a week, although individual experiences may vary.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe first signs of a cold usually include:\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny nose\\n- Coughing\\n- Sneezing\\n- General feeling of being unwell\\n\\nThese symptoms typically intensify within 2 to 3 days after exposure to the virus. As the cold develops, other symptoms may appear, such as:\\n- Body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Low-grade fever\\n- Nasal congestion\\n\\nMost symptoms begin to improve within 7 to 10 days, but they can linger longer in smokers or those with other health conditions.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and spread easily from person to person. The common ways they are transmitted include:\\n- **Respiratory droplets**: When a sick person coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the virus are released into the air.\\n- **Surface contact**: The virus can survive on surfaces for some time. If someone touches a contaminated surface and then touches their face, they can become infected.\\n\\nCrowded places, like schools and public transportation, increase the likelihood of catching a cold.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors can make individuals more likely to catch a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are often more at risk due to their developing immune systems.\\n- **Health status**: Individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic health issues are also more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle choices**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can negatively impact respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Being in crowded or close quarters can lead to easier viral transmission.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nWhile most colds are mild, they can sometimes lead to more serious complications, including:\\n- **Middle ear infections**: More common in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: This is an inflammation of the sinuses that can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Asthma attacks**: People with asthma may experience worsening of their symptoms.\\n- **Serious respiratory illnesses**: In rare cases, colds can lead to severe health issues, especially among vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nTo reduce the risk of catching or spreading a cold, consider these preventive measures:\\n- **Hand washing**: Wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer when soap is not available.\\n- **Avoid close contact**: Steer clear of sick individuals to minimize the chance of transmission.\\n- **Cleaning surfaces**: Regularly disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs and light switches.\\n- **Healthy living**: Maintain a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly to help strengthen the immune system.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no specific cure for the common cold. However, relief from symptoms can often be achieved with over-the-counter medications, such as:\\n- **Pain relievers**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce pain and fever.\\n- **Decongestants**: These medications can alleviate nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines and cough suppressants**: These can help relieve throat irritation and cough.\\n\\nAlways consult a healthcare provider before giving any medications to children.\\n\\n## 8. When to Seek Medical Care\\nIf symptoms worsen or do not improve after 7 to 10 days, or if more severe symptoms such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain occur, it is important to seek medical help as there may be a need to rule out more serious conditions.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, consider checking these resources:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Common Cold Senior Summarizer\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_3", "context": {"span_id": "0x64da810cb250f44c", "trace_id": "0xa7c6aa73de334f6444959be0753e6633"}, "parent_id": "0x25e6953d883856bc", "start_time": 1742646548282833224, "end_time": 1742646563212737571, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"896af6ca7ee342eeab388b3e10b9873c\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"1. **Overview**: The common cold is a viral infection affecting the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat).

Overview\\nThe common cold is a viral infection that mainly affects the upper parts of the respiratory system, particularly the nose and throat. There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds are more frequent during the colder months because people tend to stay indoors, which helps the viruses spread. Generally, a cold lasts for less than a week, although individual experiences may vary.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe first signs of a cold usually include:\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny nose\\n- Coughing\\n- Sneezing\\n- General feeling of being unwell\\n\\nThese symptoms typically intensify within 2 to 3 days after exposure to the virus. As the cold develops, other symptoms may appear, such as:\\n- Body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Low-grade fever\\n- Nasal congestion\\n\\nMost symptoms begin to improve within 7 to 10 days, but they can linger longer in smokers or those with other health conditions.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and spread easily from person to person. The common ways they are transmitted include:\\n- **Respiratory droplets**: When a sick person coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the virus are released into the air.\\n- **Surface contact**: The virus can survive on surfaces for some time. If someone touches a contaminated surface and then touches their face, they can become infected.\\n\\nCrowded places, like schools and public transportation, increase the likelihood of catching a cold.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors can make individuals more likely to catch a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are often more at risk due to their developing immune systems.\\n- **Health status**: Individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic health issues are also more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle choices**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can negatively impact respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Being in crowded or close quarters can lead to easier viral transmission.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nWhile most colds are mild, they can sometimes lead to more serious complications, including:\\n- **Middle ear infections**: More common in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: This is an inflammation of the sinuses that can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Asthma attacks**: People with asthma may experience worsening of their symptoms.\\n- **Serious respiratory illnesses**: In rare cases, colds can lead to severe health issues, especially among vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nTo reduce the risk of catching or spreading a cold, consider these preventive measures:\\n- **Hand washing**: Wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer when soap is not available.\\n- **Avoid close contact**: Steer clear of sick individuals to minimize the chance of transmission.\\n- **Cleaning surfaces**: Regularly disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs and light switches.\\n- **Healthy living**: Maintain a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly to help strengthen the immune system.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no specific cure for the common cold. However, relief from symptoms can often be achieved with over-the-counter medications, such as:\\n- **Pain relievers**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce pain and fever.\\n- **Decongestants**: These medications can alleviate nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines and cough suppressants**: These can help relieve throat irritation and cough.\\n\\nAlways consult a healthcare provider before giving any medications to children.\\n\\n## 8. When to Seek Medical Care\\nIf symptoms worsen or do not improve after 7 to 10 days, or if more severe symptoms such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain occur, it is important to seek medical help as there may be a need to rule out more serious conditions.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, consider checking these resources:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n```\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_8", "context": {"span_id": "0x06f536b47ec55041", "trace_id": "0xa7c6aa73de334f6444959be0753e6633"}, "parent_id": "0x64da810cb250f44c", "start_time": 1742646548290363564, "end_time": 1742646563039121315, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"896af6ca7ee342eeab388b3e10b9873c\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Common Cold Senior Summarizer\\n.

Symptoms\\nThe onset of a cold is marked by early symptoms such as a sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and general malaise. These symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days post-infection. As the cold progresses, additional symptoms may arise, including body aches, headaches, low-grade fevers, and nasal congestion. Most cold symptoms start to improve within 7 to 10 days, although some may persist longer in individuals who smoke.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nThe common cold is highly contagious. It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Additionally, it can be transmitted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus followed by touching one’s face. This mode of transmission is especially prominent in crowded settings like schools, public transport, and gatherings.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors increase the risk of contracting a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are at a higher risk due to their still-developing immune systems.\\n- **Immune System**: Individuals with weakened immune systems owing to underlying health issues are more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke exacerbate risk by impairing respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Crowded locations enhance virus transmission likelihood, particularly in schools and public transport systems.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nAlthough the common cold is generally mild, it can lead to several complications, including:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation of the sinuses can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Exacerbation of Asthma**: Individuals with asthma may experience worsened symptoms.\\n- **Severe Respiratory Diseases**: In rare cases, colds can lead to more severe conditions, especially in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nPreventive measures include:\\n- **Hand Hygiene**: Regularly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizers are effective when soap is unavailable.\\n- **Avoiding Contact**: Keeping distance from individuals who are symptomatic can reduce transmission risk.\\n- **Disinfection**: Regular cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces to eliminate viral presence.\\n- **Healthy Lifestyle**: A balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and regular exercise can fortify the immune system against infections.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no specific cure for the common cold. Relief from symptoms can be achieved through over-the-counter medications such as:\\n- **Pain Relievers**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for headaches and body aches.\\n- **Decongestants**: To alleviate nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines and Cough Suppressants**: To help manage throat irritation and coughing.\\n\\nConsultation with a healthcare provider is crucial before administering any medications to children.\\n\\n## 8.

Overview\\nThe common cold is a viral infection that mainly affects the upper parts of the respiratory system, particularly the nose and throat. There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds are more frequent during the colder months because people tend to stay indoors, which helps the viruses spread. Generally, a cold lasts for less than a week, although individual experiences may vary.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe first signs of a cold usually include:\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny nose\\n- Coughing\\n- Sneezing\\n- General feeling of being unwell\\n\\nThese symptoms typically intensify within 2 to 3 days after exposure to the virus. As the cold develops, other symptoms may appear, such as:\\n- Body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Low-grade fever\\n- Nasal congestion\\n\\nMost symptoms begin to improve within 7 to 10 days, but they can linger longer in smokers or those with other health conditions.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and spread easily from person to person. The common ways they are transmitted include:\\n- **Respiratory droplets**: When a sick person coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the virus are released into the air.\\n- **Surface contact**: The virus can survive on surfaces for some time. If someone touches a contaminated surface and then touches their face, they can become infected.\\n\\nCrowded places, like schools and public transportation, increase the likelihood of catching a cold.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors can make individuals more likely to catch a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are often more at risk due to their developing immune systems.\\n- **Health status**: Individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic health issues are also more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle choices**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can negatively impact respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Being in crowded or close quarters can lead to easier viral transmission.\\n\\n## 5.

This disease is known for its sudden onset of symptoms and can lead to severe health complications if not treated effectively. It's important to understand the nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context of influenza to minimize its effects on public health.\\n\\n## Types of Influenza Viruses\\nInfluenza viruses are categorized into four main types:\\n\\n1. **Influenza A**: This is the most widespread type of influenza virus responsible for causing seasonal outbreaks and pandemics. It can infect various animals, including birds and pigs, as well as humans. Influenza A is often associated with the most severe illness during flu seasons.\\n\\n2. **Influenza B**: Predominantly found in humans, this type causes seasonal outbreaks but does not lead to widespread pandemics. Vaccines targeting influenza B are included in the annual flu vaccination.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: This type causes mild respiratory infections and is less frequent than types A and B. It does not typically lead to significant outbreaks or severe health issues.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: Mainly affects cattle and does not pose a direct threat to human health, as it rarely infects people.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can survive on surfaces, making it possible for individuals to become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their faces. Understanding these transmission methods is crucial for effective prevention.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms generally appear between one to four days after exposure and can last anywhere from two to eight days. Common symptoms include:\\n\\n- **Fever**: A high temperature is often present.\\n- **Cough**: Frequent and persistent.\\n- **Sore throat**: Discomfort while swallowing.\\n- **Muscle aches**: General body pain and discomfort.\\n- **Headache**: Pain in the head region.\\n- **Fatigue**: A deep sense of tiredness.\\n- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Such as diarrhea and vomiting, particularly more common in children.\\n\\nSymptoms can be intense and may lead to further health issues if not managed appropriately.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nThe most effective ways to prevent influenza include:\\n\\n- **Annual flu vaccines**: Recommended for everyone aged six months and older, these vaccines protect against multiple strains of influenza A and B.\\n- **Good hygiene practices**: Regular handwashing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and cleaning commonly touched surfaces can help prevent infection.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nWhen it comes to treating influenza, standard approaches include:\\n\\n- **Supportive care**: For mild cases, rest, staying hydrated, and over-the-counter medications can help manage symptoms.\\n- **Antiviral medications**: Drugs like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be used, especially for severe cases or for individuals at high risk of complications.\\n\\n## Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations including:\\n\\n- **Pneumonia**: Life-threatening lung infection.\\n- **Bronchitis**: Inflammation of the airways.\\n- **Sinus and ear infections**: Secondary infections that may develop.\\n- **Worsening of chronic conditions**: Such as asthma or heart disease.\\n\\nYoung children, older adults, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing health issues are especially at risk for severe influenza impact.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nInfluenza causes seasonal epidemics, especially in temperate regions, with peaks during winter months. Estimates indicate that:\\n\\n- Influenza affects around 5-15% of the global population annually.\\n- About 3-5 million cases are deemed severe, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths related to respiratory diseases from influenza each year.\\n\\nFor the 2023-2024 influenza season, it was estimated that around 40 million people fell ill, with approximately 28,000 influenza-related deaths.\\n\\n## History\\nInfluenza has a history of causing notable pandemics, such as:\\n\\n- **The Spanish Flu (1918-1919)**: Resulting in millions of deaths and changing global health responses.\\n- **The 2009 H1N1 pandemic**: A renewed focus on effective vaccination and treatment strategies was prompted by this outbreak.\\n\\nOngoing improvements in vaccination approaches and treatment policies continue to evolve with new insights gained about this viral infection.\\n\\n## Sources for Further Information\\nFor more detailed information, the following resources are recommended:\\n\\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n- [Wikipedia on Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)\\n\\nThis report offers a thorough overview of influenza, encompassing critical insights into its nature, how it spreads, preventive measures, treatment options, and important historical context, bolstered by reputable sources.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"tasks_output\": [{\"description\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Influenza (Flu) Make sure you find any relevant information of renowned sources.\\n\", \"name\": \"research_task\", \"expected_output\": \"A set of relevant information about Influenza (Flu)\\n\", \"summary\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Influenza (Flu) Make sure you...\", \"raw\": \"Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses that affect the respiratory system, primarily the nose, throat, and lungs.

This disease is known for its sudden onset of symptoms and can lead to severe health complications if not treated effectively. It's important to understand the nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context of influenza to minimize its effects on public health.\\n\\n## Types of Influenza Viruses\\nInfluenza viruses are categorized into four main types:\\n\\n1. **Influenza A**: This is the most widespread type of influenza virus responsible for causing seasonal outbreaks and pandemics. It can infect various animals, including birds and pigs, as well as humans. Influenza A is often associated with the most severe illness during flu seasons.\\n\\n2. **Influenza B**: Predominantly found in humans, this type causes seasonal outbreaks but does not lead to widespread pandemics. Vaccines targeting influenza B are included in the annual flu vaccination.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: This type causes mild respiratory infections and is less frequent than types A and B. It does not typically lead to significant outbreaks or severe health issues.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: Mainly affects cattle and does not pose a direct threat to human health, as it rarely infects people.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can survive on surfaces, making it possible for individuals to become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their faces. Understanding these transmission methods is crucial for effective prevention.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms generally appear between one to four days after exposure and can last anywhere from two to eight days. Common symptoms include:\\n\\n- **Fever**: A high temperature is often present.\\n- **Cough**: Frequent and persistent.\\n- **Sore throat**: Discomfort while swallowing.\\n- **Muscle aches**: General body pain and discomfort.\\n- **Headache**: Pain in the head region.\\n- **Fatigue**: A deep sense of tiredness.\\n- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Such as diarrhea and vomiting, particularly more common in children.\\n\\nSymptoms can be intense and may lead to further health issues if not managed appropriately.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nThe most effective ways to prevent influenza include:\\n\\n- **Annual flu vaccines**: Recommended for everyone aged six months and older, these vaccines protect against multiple strains of influenza A and B.\\n- **Good hygiene practices**: Regular handwashing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and cleaning commonly touched surfaces can help prevent infection.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nWhen it comes to treating influenza, standard approaches include:\\n\\n- **Supportive care**: For mild cases, rest, staying hydrated, and over-the-counter medications can help manage symptoms.\\n- **Antiviral medications**: Drugs like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be used, especially for severe cases or for individuals at high risk of complications.\\n\\n## Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations including:\\n\\n- **Pneumonia**: Life-threatening lung infection.\\n- **Bronchitis**: Inflammation of the airways.\\n- **Sinus and ear infections**: Secondary infections that may develop.\\n- **Worsening of chronic conditions**: Such as asthma or heart disease.\\n\\nYoung children, older adults, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing health issues are especially at risk for severe influenza impact.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nInfluenza causes seasonal epidemics, especially in temperate regions, with peaks during winter months. Estimates indicate that:\\n\\n- Influenza affects around 5-15% of the global population annually.\\n- About 3-5 million cases are deemed severe, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths related to respiratory diseases from influenza each year.\\n\\nFor the 2023-2024 influenza season, it was estimated that around 40 million people fell ill, with approximately 28,000 influenza-related deaths.\\n\\n## History\\nInfluenza has a history of causing notable pandemics, such as:\\n\\n- **The Spanish Flu (1918-1919)**: Resulting in millions of deaths and changing global health responses.\\n- **The 2009 H1N1 pandemic**: A renewed focus on effective vaccination and treatment strategies was prompted by this outbreak.\\n\\nOngoing improvements in vaccination approaches and treatment policies continue to evolve with new insights gained about this viral infection.\\n\\n## Sources for Further Information\\nFor more detailed information, the following resources are recommended:\\n\\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n- [Wikipedia on Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)\\n\\nThis report offers a thorough overview of influenza, encompassing critical insights into its nature, how it spreads, preventive measures, treatment options, and important historical context, bolstered by reputable sources.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Influenza (Flu) Senior Summarizer\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}], \"token_usage\": {\"total_tokens\": 78800, \"prompt_tokens\": 74655, \"cached_prompt_tokens\": 22784, \"completion_tokens\": 4145, \"successful_requests\": 11}}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Task.execute_sync_4", "context": {"span_id": "0x830a6fb2e8f4f4e9", "trace_id": "0xa7c6aa73de334f6444959be0753e6633"}, "parent_id": "0xdebf85f2ea629edf", "start_time": 1742646563237953455, "end_time": 1742646600034841779, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"896af6ca7ee342eeab388b3e10b9873c\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"CHAIN\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"\", \"tools\": [{\"name\": \"Search the internet with Serper\", \"description\": \"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

Symptoms range from mild to severe and often include fever , runny nose , sore throat , muscle pain , headache , coughing , and fatigue . These symptoms begin one to four (typically two) days after exposure to the virus and last for about two to eight days. Diarrhea and vomiting can occur, particularly in children. Influenza may progress to pneumonia from the virus or a subsequent bacterial infection . Other complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome , meningitis , encephalitis , and worsening of pre-existing health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular disease .\\n There are four types of influenza virus: types A, B, C, and D. Aquatic birds are the primary source of influenza A virus (IAV), which is also widespread in various mammals, including humans and pigs. Influenza B virus (IBV) and influenza C virus (ICV) primarily infect humans, and influenza D virus (IDV) is found in cattle and pigs. Influenza A virus and influenza B virus circulate in humans and cause seasonal epidemics , and influenza C virus causes a mild infection, primarily in children. Influenza D virus can infect humans but is not known to cause illness. In humans, influenza viruses are primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. Transmission through aerosols and surfaces contaminated by the virus also occur.\\n Frequent hand washing and covering one's mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing reduce transmission, as does wearing a mask. Annual vaccination can help to provide protection against influenza. Influenza viruses, particularly influenza A virus, evolve quickly, so flu vaccines are updated regularly to match which influenza strains are in circulation. Vaccines provide protection against influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and one or two influenza B virus subtypes. Influenza infection is diagnosed with laboratory methods such as antibody or antigen tests and a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) to identify viral nucleic acid . The disease can be treated with supportive measures and, in severe cases, with antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir . In healthy individuals, influenza is typically self-limiting and rarely fatal, but it can be deadly in high-risk groups.\\n In a typical year, five to 15 percent of the population contracts influenza. There are 3 to 5 million severe cases annually, with up to 650,000 respiratory-related deaths globally each year. Deaths most commonly occur in high-risk groups, including young children, the elderly, and people with chronic health conditions. In temperate regions , the number of influenza cases peaks during winter, whereas in the tropics , influenza can occur year-round. Since the late 1800s, pandemic outbreaks of novel influenza strains have occurred every 10 to 50 years. Five flu pandemics have occurred since 1900: the Spanish flu from 1918 to 1920, which was the most severe; the Asian flu in 1957; the Hong Kong flu in 1968; the Russian flu in 1977; and the swine flu pandemic in 2009.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nSymptoms of influenza, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] with fever and cough the most common symptoms [ 7 ]\\nThe symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The time between exposure to the virus and development of symptoms (the incubation period ) is one to four days, most commonly one to two days. Many infections are asymptomatic. [ 10 ] The onset of symptoms is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific, including fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain , malaise , loss of appetite , lack of energy, and confusion. These are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough , sore or dry throat , hoarse voice , and a stuffy or runny nose . Coughing is the most common symptom. [ 1 ] Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, [ 11 ] and gastroenteritis, [ 12 ] especially in children. The standard influenza symptoms typically last for two to eight days. [ 13 ] Some studies suggest influenza can cause long-lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]\\nSymptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract , but progression to pneumonia is relatively common. Pneumonia may be caused by the primary viral infection or a secondary bacterial infection . Primary pneumonia is characterized by rapid progression of fever, cough, labored breathing , and low oxygen levels that cause bluish skin . It is especially common among those who have an underlying cardiovascular disease such as rheumatic heart disease . Secondary pneumonia typically has a period of improvement in symptoms for one to three weeks [ 17 ] followed by recurrent fever, sputum production, and fluid buildup in the lungs , [ 1 ] but can also occur just a few days after influenza symptoms appear. [ 17 ] About a third of primary pneumonia cases are followed by secondary pneumonia, which is most frequently caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus . [ 10 ] [ 1 ]\\nVirology\\nTypes of virus\\nInfluenza virus nomenclature (for a Fujian flu virus)\\nInfluenza viruses comprise four species, each the sole member of its own genus. The four influenza genera comprise four of the seven genera in the family Orthomyxoviridae . They are: [ 1 ] [ 18 ]\\nInfluenza A virus , genus Alphainfluenzavirus\\nInfluenza B virus , genus Betainfluenzavirus\\nInfluenza C virus , genus Gammainfluenzavirus\\nInfluenza D virus , genus Deltainfluenzavirus\\nInfluenza A virus is responsible for most cases of severe illness as well as seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. It infects people of all ages but tends to disproportionately cause severe illness in the elderly, the very young, and those with chronic health issues. Birds are the primary reservoir of influenza A virus, especially aquatic birds such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] but the virus also circulates among mammals, including pigs, horses, and marine mammals.\\n Subtypes of Influenza A are defined by the combination of the antigenic viral proteins haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) in the viral envelope ; for example, \\\" H1N1 \\\" designates an IAV subtype that has a type-1 hemagglutinin (H) protein and a type-1 neuraminidase (N) protein. [ 21 ] Almost all possible combinations of H (1 thru 16) and N (1 thru 11) have been isolated from wild birds. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] In addition H17, H18, N10 and N11 have been found in bats. [ 24 ] [ 23 ] The influenza A virus subtypes in circulation among humans are H1N1 and H3N2. [ 2 ]\\nInfluenza B virus mainly infects humans but has been identified in seals, horses, dogs, and pigs. [ 23 ] Influenza B virus does not have subtypes like influenza A virus but has two antigenically distinct lineages, termed the B/Victoria/2/1987-like and B/Yamagata/16/1988-like lineages, [ 1 ] or simply (B/)Victoria(-like) and (B/)Yamagata(-like). [ 23 ] [ 2 ] Both lineages are in circulation in humans, [ 1 ] disproportionately affecting children. [ 11 ] However, the B/Yamagata lineage might have become extinct in 2020/2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic measures. [ 25 ] Influenza B viruses contribute to seasonal epidemics alongside influenza A viruses but have never been associated with a pandemic. [ 23 ]\\nInfluenza C virus, like influenza B virus, is primarily found in humans, though it has been detected in pigs, feral dogs, dromedary camels, cattle, and dogs. [ 12 ] [ 23 ] Influenza C virus infection primarily affects children and is usually asymptomatic [ 1 ] [ 11 ] or has mild cold-like symptoms, though more severe symptoms such as gastroenteritis and pneumonia can occur. [ 12 ] Unlike influenza A virus and influenza B virus, influenza C virus has not been a major focus of research pertaining to antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other measures against influenza. [ 23 ] Influenza C virus is subclassified into six genetic/antigenic lineages. [ 12 ] [ 26 ]\\nInfluenza D virus has been isolated from pigs and cattle, the latter being the natural reservoir. Infection has also been observed in humans, horses, dromedary camels, and small ruminants such as goats and sheep. [ 23 ] [ 26 ] Influenza D virus is distantly related to influenza C virus. While cattle workers have occasionally tested positive to prior influenza D virus infection, it is not known to cause disease in humans. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Influenza C virus and influenza D virus experience a slower rate of antigenic evolution than influenza A virus and influenza B virus. Because of this antigenic stability, relatively few novel lineages emerge. [ 26 ]\\nInfluenza virus nomenclature\\nDiagram of influenza nomenclature\\nEvery year, millions of influenza virus samples are analysed to monitor changes in the virus' antigenic properties, and to inform the development of vaccines. [ 27 ]\\nTo unambiguously describe a specific isolate of virus, researchers use the internationally accepted influenza virus nomenclature, [ 28 ] which describes, among other things, the species of animal from which the virus was isolated, and the place and year of collection. As an example – \\\"A/chicken/Nakorn-Patom/Thailand/CU-K2/04(H5N1)\\\":\\n\\\"A\\\" stands for the genus of influenza ( A , B , C or D ).\\n\\\"chicken\\\" is the animal species the isolate was found in (note: human isolates lack this component term and are thus identified as human isolates by default)\\n\\\"Nakorn-Patom/Thailand\\\" is the place this specific virus was isolated\\n\\\"CU-K2\\\" is the laboratory reference number that identifies it from other influenza viruses isolated at the same place and year\\n\\\"04\\\" represents the year of isolation 2004\\n\\\"H5\\\" stands for the fifth of several known types of the protein hemagglutinin .\\n\\\"N1\\\" stands for the first of several known types of the protein neuraminidase . [ 29 ]\\nThe nomenclature for influenza B, C and D, which are less variable, is simpler. Examples are B/Santiago/29615/2020 and C/Minnesota/10/2015. [ 29 ]\\nGenome and structure\\nStructure of the influenza virion . The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins are shown on the surface of the particle. The viral RNAs that make up the genome are shown as red coils inside the particle and bound to ribonucleoproteins (RNP).\\nInfluenza viruses have a negative-sense , single-stranded RNA genome that is segmented. The negative sense of the genome means it can be used as a template to synthesize messenger RNA (mRNA). [ 10 ] Influenza A virus and influenza B virus have eight genome segments that encode 10 major proteins. Influenza C virus and influenza D virus have seven genome segments that encode nine major proteins. [ 12 ]\\nThree segments encode three subunits of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex: PB1, a transcriptase, PB2, which recognizes 5' caps , and PA (P3 for influenza C virus and influenza D virus), an endonuclease . [ 30 ] The M1 matrix protein and M2 proton channel share a segment, as do the non-structural protein (NS1) and the nuclear export protein (NEP). [ 1 ] For influenza A virus and influenza B virus, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are encoded on one segment each, whereas influenza C virus and influenza D virus encode a hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) protein on one segment that merges the functions of HA and NA. The final genome segment encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP). [ 30 ] Influenza viruses also encode various accessory proteins, such as PB1-F2 and PA-X, that are expressed through alternative open reading frames [ 1 ] [ 31 ] and which are important in host defense suppression, virulence, and pathogenicity. [ 32 ]\\nThe virus particle, called a virion, is pleomorphic and varies between being filamentous, bacilliform, or spherical in shape. Clinical isolates tend to be pleomorphic, whereas strains adapted to laboratory growth typically produce spherical virions. Filamentous virions are about 250 nanometers (nm) by 80 nm, bacilliform 120–250 by 95 nm, and spherical 120 nm in diameter. [ 33 ]\\nThe core of the virion comprises one copy of each segment of the genome bound to NP nucleoproteins in separate ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes for each segment. There is a copy of the RdRp, all subunits included, bound to each RNP. The genetic material is encapsulated by a layer of M1 matrix protein which provides structural reinforcement to the outer layer, the viral envelope . [ 3 ] The envelope comprises a lipid bilayer membrane incorporating HA and NA (or HEF [ 26 ] ) proteins extending outward from its exterior surface. HA and HEF [ 26 ] proteins have a distinct \\\"head\\\" and \\\"stalk\\\" structure. M2 proteins form proton channels through the viral envelope that are required for viral entry and exit. Influenza B viruses contain a surface protein named NB that is anchored in the envelope, but its function is unknown. [ 1 ]\\nLife cycle\\nHost cell invasion and replication by the influenza virus\\nThe viral life cycle begins by binding to a target cell. Binding is mediated by the viral HA proteins on the surface of the envelope, which bind to cells that contain sialic acid receptors on the surface of the cell membrane. [ 1 ] [ 19 ] [ 3 ] For N1 subtypes with the \\\"G147R\\\" mutation and N2 subtypes, the NA protein can initiate entry. Prior to binding, NA proteins promote access to target cells by degrading mucus, which helps to remove extracellular decoy receptors that would impede access to target cells. [ 3 ] After binding, the virus is internalized into the cell by an endosome that contains the virion inside it. The endosome is acidified by cellular vATPase [ 31 ] to have lower pH, which triggers a conformational change in HA that allows fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. [ 32 ] At the same time, hydrogen ions diffuse into the virion through M2 ion channels, disrupting internal protein-protein interactions to release RNPs into the host cell's cytosol . The M1 protein shell surrounding RNPs is degraded, fully uncoating RNPs in the cytosol. [ 31 ] [ 3 ]\\nRNPs are then imported into the nucleus with the help of viral localization signals. There, the viral RNA polymerase transcribes mRNA using the genomic negative-sense strand as a template. The polymerase snatches 5' caps for viral mRNA from cellular RNA to prime mRNA synthesis and the 3'-end of mRNA is polyadenylated at the end of transcription. [ 30 ] Once viral mRNA is transcribed, it is exported out of the nucleus and translated by host ribosomes in a cap-dependent manner to synthesize viral proteins. [ 31 ] RdRp also synthesizes complementary positive-sense strands of the viral genome in a complementary RNP complex which are then used as templates by viral polymerases to synthesize copies of the negative-sense genome. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] During these processes, RdRps of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) function optimally at a higher temperature than mammalian influenza viruses. [ 13 ]\\nNewly synthesized viral polymerase subunits and NP proteins are imported to the nucleus to further increase the rate of viral replication and form RNPs. [ 30 ] HA, NA, and M2 proteins are trafficked with the aid of M1 and NEP proteins [ 32 ] to the cell membrane through the Golgi apparatus [ 30 ] and inserted into the cell's membrane. Viral non-structural proteins including NS1, PB1-F2, and PA-X regulate host cellular processes to disable antiviral responses. [ 1 ] [ 32 ] [ 3 ] PB1-F2 also interacts with PB1 to keep polymerases in the nucleus longer. [ 20 ] M1 and NEP proteins localize to the nucleus during the later stages of infection, bind to viral RNPs and mediate their export to the cytoplasm where they migrate to the cell membrane with the aid of recycled endosomes and are bundled into the segments of the genome. [ 1 ] [ 3 ]\\nProgeny viruses leave the cell by budding from the cell membrane, which is initiated by the accumulation of M1 proteins at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The viral genome is incorporated inside a viral envelope derived from portions of the cell membrane that have HA, NA, and M2 proteins. At the end of budding, HA proteins remain attached to cellular sialic acid until they are cleaved by the sialidase activity of NA proteins. The virion is then released from the cell. The sialidase activity of NA also cleaves any sialic acid residues from the viral surface, which helps prevent newly assembled viruses from aggregating near the cell surface and improving infectivity. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] Similar to other aspects of influenza replication, optimal NA activity is temperature- and pH-dependent. [ 13 ] Ultimately, presence of large quantities of viral RNA in the cell triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death), which is initiated by cellular factors to restrict viral replication. [ 31 ]\\nAntigenic drift and shift\\nEvolution mechanisms of IAV. (A) Antigenic Drift : Gradual accumulation of mutations in the genome of IAVs leads to emergence of new virus variants. (B) Antigenic Shift : The reassortment of genetic segments between two or more invading IAVs in a host cell can lead to emergence of an antigenically novel subtype.\\nTwo key processes that influenza viruses evolve through are antigenic drift and antigenic shift . Antigenic drift is when an influenza virus' antigens change due to the gradual accumulation of mutations in the antigen's (HA or NA) gene. [ 19 ] This can occur in response to evolutionary pressure exerted by the host immune response. Antigenic drift is especially common for the HA protein, in which just a few amino acid changes in the head region can constitute antigenic drift. [ 2 ] [ 26 ] The result is the production of novel strains that can evade pre-existing antibody-mediated immunity. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] Antigenic drift occurs in all influenza species but is slower in B than A and slowest in C and D. [ 26 ] Antigenic drift is a major cause of seasonal influenza, [ 34 ] and requires that flu vaccines be updated annually. HA is the main component of inactivated vaccines, so surveillance monitors antigenic drift of this antigen among circulating strains. Antigenic evolution of influenza viruses of humans appears to be faster than in swine and equines. In wild birds, within-subtype antigenic variation appears to be limited but has been observed in poultry. [ 1 ] [ 11 ]\\nAntigenic shift is a sudden, drastic change in an influenza virus' antigen, usually HA. During antigenic shift, antigenically different strains that infect the same cell can reassort genome segments with each other, producing hybrid progeny. Since all influenza viruses have segmented genomes, all are capable of reassortment. [ 12 ] [ 26 ] Antigenic shift only occurs among influenza viruses of the same genus [ 30 ] and most commonly occurs among influenza A viruses. In particular, reassortment is very common in AIVs, creating a large diversity of influenza viruses in birds, but is uncommon in human, equine, and canine lineages. [ 35 ] Pigs, bats, and quails have receptors for both mammalian and avian influenza A viruses, so they are potential \\\"mixing vessels\\\" for reassortment. [ 23 ] If an animal strain reassorts with a human strain, [ 2 ] then a novel strain can emerge that is capable of human-to-human transmission. This has caused pandemics, but only a limited number, so it is difficult to predict when the next will happen. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] \\nThe Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System of the World Health Organization (GISRS) tests several millions of specimens annually to monitor the spread and evolution of influenza viruses. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 27 ]\\nMechanism\\nTransmission\\nPeople who are infected can transmit influenza viruses through breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing, which spread respiratory droplets and aerosols that contain virus particles into the air. A person susceptible to infection can contract influenza by coming into contact with these particles. [ 17 ] [ 38 ] Respiratory droplets are relatively large and travel less than two meters before falling onto nearby surfaces. Aerosols are smaller and remain suspended in the air longer, so they take longer to settle and can travel further. [ 38 ] [ 4 ] Inhalation of aerosols can lead to infection, [ 39 ] but most transmission is in the area about two meters around an infected person via respiratory droplets [ 10 ] that come into contact with mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. [ 39 ] Transmission through contact with a person, bodily fluids, or intermediate objects ( fomites ) can also occur, [ 10 ] [ 38 ] since influenza viruses can survive for hours on non-porous surfaces. [ 4 ] If one's hands are contaminated, then touching one's face can cause infection. [ 40 ]\\nInfluenza is usually transmissible from one day before the onset of symptoms to 5–7 days after. [ 11 ] In healthy adults, the virus is shed for up to 3–5 days. In children and the immunocompromised, the virus may be transmissible for several weeks. [ 10 ] Children ages 2–17 are considered to be the primary and most efficient spreaders of influenza. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] Children who have not had multiple prior exposures to influenza viruses shed the virus at greater quantities and for a longer duration than other children. [ 1 ] People at risk of exposure to influenza include health care workers, social care workers, and those who live with or care for people vulnerable to influenza. In long-term care facilities, the flu can spread rapidly. [ 11 ] A variety of factors likely encourage influenza transmission, including lower temperature, lower absolute and relative humidity , less ultraviolet radiation from the sun, [ 39 ] [ 41 ] and crowding. [ 38 ] Influenza viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract like H1N1 tend to be more mild but more transmissible, whereas those that infect the lower respiratory tract like H5N1 tend to cause more severe illness but are less contagious. [ 10 ]\\nPathophysiology\\nHow the different sites of infection (shown in red) of H1N1 and H5N1 influences their transmission and lethality [ 42 ]\\nIn humans, influenza viruses first cause infection by infecting epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. Illness during infection is primarily the result of lung inflammation and compromise caused by epithelial cell infection and death, combined with inflammation caused by the immune system's response to infection. Non-respiratory organs can become involved, but the mechanisms by which influenza is involved in these cases are unknown. Severe respiratory illness can be caused by multiple, non-exclusive mechanisms, including obstruction of the airways, loss of alveolar structure, loss of lung epithelial integrity due to epithelial cell infection and death, and degradation of the extracellular matrix that maintains lung structure. In particular, alveolar cell infection appears to drive severe symptoms since this results in impaired gas exchange and enables viruses to infect endothelial cells, which produce large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines . [ 17 ]\\nPneumonia caused by influenza viruses is characterized by high levels of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, accompanied by a strong pro-inflammatory response called a cytokine storm . [ 1 ] Infection with H5N1 or H7N9 especially produces high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. [ 19 ] In bacterial infections, early depletion of macrophages during influenza creates a favorable environment in the lungs for bacterial growth since these white blood cells are important in responding to bacterial infection. Host mechanisms to encourage tissue repair may inadvertently allow bacterial infection. Infection also induces production of systemic glucocorticoids that can reduce inflammation to preserve tissue integrity but allow increased bacterial growth. [ 17 ]\\nThe pathophysiology of influenza is significantly influenced by which receptors influenza viruses bind to during entry into cells. Mammalian influenza viruses preferentially bind to sialic acids connected to the rest of the oligosaccharide by an α-2,6 link, most commonly found in various respiratory cells, [ 1 ] [ 19 ] [ 3 ] such as respiratory and retinal epithelial cells. [ 31 ] AIVs prefer sialic acids with an α-2,3 linkage, which are most common in birds in gastrointestinal epithelial cells [ 1 ] [ 19 ] [ 3 ] and in humans in the lower respiratory tract. [ 43 ] Cleavage of the HA protein into HA 1 , the binding subunit, and HA 2 , the fusion subunit, is performed by different proteases, affecting which cells can be infected. For mammalian influenza viruses and low pathogenic AIVs, cleavage is extracellular, which limits infection to cells that have the appropriate proteases, whereas for highly pathogenic AIVs, cleavage is intracellular and performed by ubiquitous proteases, which allows for infection of a greater variety of cells, thereby contributing to more severe disease. [ 1 ] [ 35 ] [ 44 ]\\nImmunology\\nCells possess sensors to detect viral RNA, which can then induce interferon production. Interferons mediate expression of antiviral proteins and proteins that recruit immune cells to the infection site, and they notify nearby uninfected cells of infection. Some infected cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection. Immune cells control viral infection by killing infected cells and phagocytizing viral particles and apoptotic cells. An exacerbated immune response can harm the host organism through a cytokine storm. [ 1 ] [ 13 ] [ 31 ] To counter the immune response, influenza viruses encode various non-structural proteins, including NS1, NEP, PB1-F2, and PA-X, that are involved in curtailing the host immune response by suppressing interferon production and host gene expression. [ 1 ] [ 32 ]\\nB cells , a type of white blood cell, produce antibodies that bind to influenza antigens HA and NA (or HEF [ 26 ] ) and other proteins to a lesser degree. Once bound to these proteins, antibodies block virions from binding to cellular receptors, neutralizing the virus. In humans, a sizeable antibody response occurs about one week after viral exposure. [ 45 ] This antibody response is typically robust and long-lasting, especially for influenza C virus and influenza D virus. [ 1 ] [ 26 ] People exposed to a certain strain in childhood still possess antibodies to that strain at a reasonable level later in life, which can provide some protection to related strains. [ 1 ] There is, however, an \\\" original antigenic sin \\\", in which the first HA subtype a person is exposed to influences the antibody-based immune response to future infections and vaccines. [ 2 ]\\nPrevention\\nFurther information: Prevention of influenza\\nVaccination\\nMain article: Influenza vaccine\\nGiving an influenza vaccination\\nAnnual vaccination is the primary and most effective way to prevent influenza and influenza-associated complications, especially for high-risk groups. [ 10 ] [ 1 ] [ 46 ] Vaccines against the flu are trivalent or quadrivalent, providing protection against an H1N1 strain, an H3N2 strain, and one or two influenza B virus strains corresponding to the two influenza B virus lineages. [ 10 ] [ 2 ] Two types of vaccines are in use: inactivated vaccines that contain \\\"killed\\\" (i.e. inactivated) viruses and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) that contain weakened viruses. [ 1 ] There are three types of inactivated vaccines: whole virus, split virus, in which the virus is disrupted by a detergent, and subunit, which only contains the viral antigens HA and NA. [ 47 ] Most flu vaccines are inactivated and administered via intramuscular injection. LAIVs are sprayed into the nasal cavity. [ 1 ]\\nVaccination recommendations vary by country. Some recommend vaccination for all people above a certain age, such as 6 months, [ 46 ] whereas other countries limit recommendations to high-risk groups. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] Young infants cannot receive flu vaccines for safety reasons, but they can inherit passive immunity from their mother if vaccinated during pregnancy. [ 48 ] Influenza vaccination helps to reduce the probability of reassortment. [ 13 ]\\nAn Influenza A&B Antigen Test (bottom) showing negative results for both Influenza A and B)\\nIn general, influenza vaccines are only effective if there is an antigenic match between vaccine strains and circulating strains. [ 10 ] [ 2 ] Most commercially available flu vaccines are manufactured by propagation of influenza viruses in embryonated chicken eggs, taking 6–8 months. [ 2 ] Flu seasons are different in the northern and southern hemisphere, so the WHO meets twice a year, once for each hemisphere, to discuss which strains should be included based on observation from HA inhibition assays. [ 10 ] [ 3 ] Other manufacturing methods include an MDCK cell culture-based inactivated vaccine and a recombinant subunit vaccine manufactured from baculovirus overexpression in insect cells. [ 2 ] [ 49 ]\\nAntiviral chemoprophylaxis\\nInfluenza can be prevented or reduced in severity by post-exposure prophylaxis with the antiviral drugs oseltamivir , which can be taken orally by those at least three months old, and zanamivir , which can be inhaled by those above seven years. Chemoprophylaxis is most useful for individuals at high risk for complications and those who cannot receive the flu vaccine. [ 10 ] Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is only recommended if oseltamivir is taken within 48 hours of contact with a confirmed or suspected case and zanamivir within 36 hours. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] It is recommended for people who have yet to receive a vaccine for the current flu season, who have been vaccinated less than two week since contact, if there is a significant mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains, or during an outbreak in a closed setting regardless of vaccination history. [ 11 ]\\nInfection control\\nFurther information: Influenza prevention\\nThese are the main ways that influenza spreads\\nby direct transmission (when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into the eyes, nose or mouth of another person);\\nthe airborne route (when someone inhales the aerosols produced by an infected person coughing, sneezing or spitting);\\nthrough hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose, or hand-to-mouth transmission, either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a hand-shake.\\nWhen vaccines and antiviral medications are limited, non-pharmaceutical interventions are essential to reduce transmission and spread. The lack of controlled studies and rigorous evidence of the effectiveness of some measures has hampered planning decisions and recommendations. Nevertheless, strategies endorsed by experts for all phases of flu outbreaks include hand and respiratory hygiene, self-isolation by symptomatic individuals and the use of face masks by them and their caregivers, surface disinfection, rapid testing and diagnosis, and contact tracing . In some cases, other forms of social distancing including school closures and travel restrictions are recommended. [ 50 ]\\nReasonably effective ways to reduce the transmission of influenza include good personal health and hygiene habits such as: not touching the eyes, nose or mouth; [ 51 ] frequent hand washing (with soap and water, or with alcohol-based hand rubs); [ 52 ] covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or sleeve; avoiding close contact with sick people; and staying home when sick. Avoiding spitting is also recommended. [ 50 ] Although face masks might help prevent transmission when caring for the sick, [ 53 ] [ 54 ] there is mixed evidence on beneficial effects in the community. [ 50 ] [ 55 ] Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as producing more severe disease symptoms. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]\\nSince influenza spreads through both aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces, surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections. [ 58 ] Alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses, while quaternary ammonium compounds can be used with alcohol so that the sanitizing effect lasts for longer. [ 59 ] In hospitals, quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach are used to sanitize rooms or equipment that have been occupied by people with influenza symptoms. [ 59 ] At home, this can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach. [ 60 ]\\nSince influenza viruses circulate in animals such as birds and pigs, prevention of transmission from these animals is important. Water treatment , indoor raising of animals, quarantining sick animals, vaccination, and biosecurity are the primary measures used. Placing poultry houses and piggeries on high ground away from high-density farms, backyard farms, live poultry markets, and bodies of water helps to minimize contact with wild birds. [ 1 ] Closure of live poultry markets appears to the most effective measure [ 19 ] and has shown to be effective at controlling the spread of H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 . [ 20 ] Other biosecurity measures include cleaning and disinfecting facilities and vehicles, banning visits to poultry farms, not bringing birds intended for slaughter back to farms, [ 61 ] changing clothes, disinfecting foot baths, and treating food and water. [ 1 ]\\nIf live poultry markets are not closed, then \\\"clean days\\\" when unsold poultry is removed and facilities are disinfected and \\\"no carry-over\\\" policies to eliminate infectious material before new poultry arrive can be used to reduce the spread of influenza viruses. If a novel influenza viruses has breached the aforementioned biosecurity measures, then rapid detection to stamp it out via quarantining, decontamination, and culling may be necessary to prevent the virus from becoming endemic. [ 1 ] Vaccines exist for avian H5, H7, and H9 subtypes that are used in some countries. [ 19 ] In China, for example, vaccination of domestic birds against H7N9 successfully limited its spread, indicating that vaccination may be an effective strategy [ 35 ] if used in combination with other measures to limit transmission. [ 1 ] In pigs and horses, management of influenza is dependent on vaccination with biosecurity. [ 1 ]\\nDiagnosis\\nX-ray of 29-year-old person with H1N1\\nDiagnosis based on symptoms is fairly accurate in otherwise healthy people during seasonal epidemics and should be suspected in cases of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis , or if encephalitis, myocarditis , or breakdown of muscle tissue occur. [ 17 ] Because influenza is similar to other viral respiratory tract illnesses, laboratory diagnosis is necessary for confirmation. Common sample collection methods for testing include nasal and throat swabs. [ 1 ] Samples may be taken from the lower respiratory tract if infection has cleared the upper but not lower respiratory tract. Influenza testing is recommended for anyone hospitalized with symptoms resembling influenza during flu season or who is connected to an influenza case. For severe cases, earlier diagnosis improves patient outcome. [ 46 ] Diagnostic methods that can identify influenza include viral cultures , antibody- and antigen-detecting tests, and nucleic acid-based tests. [ 62 ]\\nViruses can be grown in a culture of mammalian cells or embryonated eggs for 3–10 days to monitor cytopathic effect. Final confirmation can then be done via antibody staining, hemadsorption using red blood cells , or immunofluorescence microscopy. Shell vial cultures, which can identify infection via immunostaining before a cytopathic effect appears, are more sensitive than traditional cultures with results in 1–3 days. [ 1 ] [ 46 ] [ 62 ] Cultures can be used to characterize novel viruses, observe sensitivity to antiviral drugs, and monitor antigenic drift, but they are relatively slow and require specialized skills and equipment. [ 1 ]\\nSerological assays can be used to detect an antibody response to influenza after natural infection or vaccination. Common serological assays include hemagglutination inhibition assays that detect HA-specific antibodies, virus neutralization assays that check whether antibodies have neutralized the virus, and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assays. These methods tend to be relatively inexpensive and fast but are less reliable than nucleic-acid based tests. [ 1 ] [ 62 ]\\nDirect fluorescent or immunofluorescent antibody (DFA/IFA) tests involve staining respiratory epithelial cells in samples with fluorescently-labeled influenza-specific antibodies, followed by examination under a fluorescent microscope. They can differentiate between influenza A virus and influenza B virus but can not subtype influenza A virus. [ 62 ] Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are a simple way of obtaining assay results, are low cost, and produce results in less than 30 minutes, so they are commonly used, but they can not distinguish between influenza A virus and influenza B virus or between influenza A virus subtypes and are not as sensitive as nucleic-acid based tests. [ 1 ] [ 62 ]\\nNucleic acid-based tests (NATs) amplify and detect viral nucleic acid. Most of these tests take a few hours, [ 62 ] but rapid molecular assays are as fast as RIDTs. [ 46 ] Among NATs, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most traditional and considered the gold standard for diagnosing influenza [ 62 ] because it is fast and can subtype influenza A virus, but it is relatively expensive and more prone to false-positives than cultures. [ 1 ] Other NATs that have been used include loop-mediated isothermal amplification -based assays, simple amplification-based assays, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. Nucleic acid sequencing methods can identify infection by obtaining the nucleic acid sequence of viral samples to identify the virus and antiviral drug resistance. The traditional method is Sanger sequencing , but it has been largely replaced by next-generation methods that have greater sequencing speed and throughput. [ 62 ]\\nManagement\\nMain article: Treatment of influenza\\nTreatment in cases of mild or moderate illness is supportive and includes anti-fever medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen , [ 63 ] adequate fluid intake to avoid dehydration, and rest. [ 11 ] Cough drops and throat sprays may be beneficial for sore throat. It is recommended to avoid alcohol and tobacco use while ill. [ 63 ] Aspirin is not recommended to treat influenza in children due to an elevated risk of developing Reye syndrome . [ 64 ] Corticosteroids are not recommended except when treating septic shock or an underlying medical condition, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma exacerbation, since they are associated with increased mortality. [ 46 ] If a secondary bacterial infection occurs, then antibiotics may be necessary. [ 11 ]\\nAntivirals\\nAntiviral drugs [ 13 ]\\nDrug\\nRoute of administration\\nApproved age of use\\nOseltamivir\\nOral\\nAt least two weeks old\\nZanamivir\\nInhalation\\nAt least five years old\\nPeramivir\\nIntravenous injection\\nAt least 18 years old\\nLaninamivir\\nInhalation [ 1 ]\\n40 milligrams (mg) dose for people at least 10 years old, 20 mg for those under 10 [ 65 ]\\nBaloxavir marboxil\\nOral [ 4 ]\\nAt least 12 years old [ 46 ]\\nAntiviral drugs are primarily used to treat severely ill patients, especially those with compromised immune systems. Antivirals are most effective when started in the first 48 hours after symptoms appear. Later administration may still be beneficial for those who have underlying immune defects, those with more severe symptoms, or those who have a higher risk of developing complications if these individuals are still shedding the virus. Antiviral treatment is also recommended if a person is hospitalized with suspected influenza instead of waiting for test results to return and if symptoms are worsening. [ 1 ] [ 46 ] Most antiviral drugs against influenza fall into two categories: neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors and M2 inhibitors. [ 13 ] Baloxavir marboxil is a notable exception, which targets the endonuclease activity of the viral RNA polymerase and can be used as an alternative to NA and M2 inhibitors for influenza A virus and influenza B virus. [ 10 ] [ 19 ] [ 4 ]\\nNA inhibitors target the enzymatic activity of NA receptors, mimicking the binding of sialic acid in the active site of NA on influenza A virus and influenza B virus virions [ 1 ] so that viral release from infected cells and the rate of viral replication are impaired. [ 11 ] NA inhibitors include oseltamivir, which is consumed orally in a prodrug form and converted to its active form in the liver, and zanamivir, which is a powder that is inhaled nasally. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective for prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis, and research overall indicates that NA inhibitors are effective at reducing rates of complications, hospitalization, and mortality [ 1 ] and the duration of illness. [ 13 ] [ 46 ] [ 4 ] Additionally, the earlier NA inhibitors are provided, the better the outcome, [ 4 ] though late administration can still be beneficial in severe cases. [ 1 ] [ 46 ] Other NA inhibitors include laninamivir [ 1 ] and peramivir, the latter of which can be used as an alternative to oseltamivir for people who cannot tolerate or absorb it. [ 46 ]\\nThe adamantanes amantadine and rimantadine are orally administered drugs that block the influenza virus' M2 ion channel, [ 1 ] preventing viral uncoating. [ 4 ] These drugs are only functional against influenza A virus [ 46 ] but are no longer recommended for use because of widespread resistance to them among influenza A viruses. [ 4 ] Adamantane resistance first emerged in H3N2 in 2003, becoming worldwide by 2008. Oseltamivir resistance is no longer widespread because the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain (H1N1 pdm09), which is resistant to adamantanes, seemingly replaced resistant strains in circulation. Since the 2009 pandemic, oseltamivir resistance has mainly been observed in patients undergoing therapy, [ 1 ] especially the immunocompromised and young children. [ 4 ] Oseltamivir resistance is usually reported in H1N1, but has been reported in H3N2 and influenza B viruss less commonly. [ 1 ] Because of this, oseltamivir is recommended as the first drug of choice for immunocompetent people, whereas for the immunocompromised, oseltamivir is recommended against H3N2 and influenza B virus and zanamivir against H1N1 pdm09. Zanamivir resistance is observed less frequently, and resistance to peramivir and baloxavir marboxil is possible. [ 4 ]\\nPrognosis\\nIn healthy individuals, influenza infection is usually self-limiting and rarely fatal. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Symptoms usually last for 2–8 days. [ 13 ] Influenza can cause people to miss work or school, and it is associated with decreased job performance and, in older adults, reduced independence. Fatigue and malaise may last for several weeks after recovery, and healthy adults may experience pulmonary abnormalities that can take several weeks to resolve. Complications and mortality primarily occur in high-risk populations and those who are hospitalized. Severe disease and mortality are usually attributable to pneumonia from the primary viral infection or a secondary bacterial infection, [ 1 ] [ 11 ] which can progress to ARDS. [ 13 ]\\nOther respiratory complications that may occur include sinusitis , bronchitis , bronchiolitis , excess fluid buildup in the lungs, and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and asthma. Middle ear infection and croup may occur, most commonly in children. [ 10 ] [ 1 ] Secondary S. aureus infection has been observed, primarily in children, to cause toxic shock syndrome after influenza, with hypotension, fever, and reddening and peeling of the skin. [ 1 ] Complications affecting the cardiovascular system are rare and include pericarditis, fulminant myocarditis with a fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat , and exacerbation of pre-existing cardiovascular disease. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Inflammation or swelling of muscles accompanied by muscle tissue breaking down occurs rarely, usually in children, which presents as extreme tenderness and muscle pain in the legs and a reluctance to walk for 2–3 days. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] [ 17 ]\\nInfluenza can affect pregnancy, including causing smaller neonatal size, increased risk of premature birth, and an increased risk of child death shortly before or after birth. [ 11 ] Neurological complications have been associated with influenza on rare occasions, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome . [ 17 ] Additionally, febrile seizures and Reye syndrome can occur, most commonly in children. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] Influenza-associated encephalopathy can occur directly from central nervous system infection from the presence of the virus in blood and presents as sudden onset of fever with convulsions, followed by rapid progression to coma. [ 10 ] An atypical form of encephalitis called encephalitis lethargica, characterized by headache, drowsiness, and coma, may rarely occur sometime after infection. [ 1 ] In survivors of influenza-associated encephalopathy, neurological defects may occur. [ 10 ] Primarily in children, in severe cases the immune system may rarely dramatically overproduce white blood cells that release cytokines, causing severe inflammation. [ 10 ]\\nPeople who are at least 65 years of age, [ 11 ] due to a weakened immune system from aging or a chronic illness, are a high-risk group for developing complications, as are children less than one year of age and children who have not been previously exposed to influenza viruses multiple times. Pregnant women are at an elevated risk, which increases by trimester [ 1 ] and lasts up to two weeks after childbirth. [ 11 ] [ 46 ] Obesity, in particular a body mass index greater than 35–40, is associated with greater amounts of viral replication, increased severity of secondary bacterial infection, and reduced vaccination efficacy. People who have underlying health conditions are also considered at-risk, including those who have congenital or chronic heart problems or lung (e.g. asthma), kidney, liver, blood, neurological, or metabolic (e.g. diabetes ) disorders, [ 10 ] [ 1 ] [ 11 ] as are people who are immunocompromised from chemotherapy, asplenia , prolonged steroid treatment, splenic dysfunction, or HIV infection. [ 11 ] Tobacco use, including past use, places a person at risk. [ 46 ] The role of genetics in influenza is not well researched, [ 1 ] but it may be a factor in influenza mortality. [ 13 ]\\nEpidemiology\\nFurther information: Flu season and Flu pandemics\\nInfluenza mortality in symptomatic cases in the US for the 2018/2019 season [ 66 ]\\nInfluenza is typically characterized by seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. Most of the burden of influenza is a result of flu seasons caused by influenza A virus and influenza B virus. Among influenza A virus subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2 circulate in humans and are responsible for seasonal influenza. Cases disproportionately occur in children, but most severe causes are among the elderly, the very young, [ 1 ] and the immunocompromised. [ 4 ] In a typical year, influenza viruses infect 5–15% of the global population, [ 3 ] [ 62 ] causing 3–5 million cases of severe illness annually [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and accounting for 290,000–650,000 deaths each year due to respiratory illness. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 67 ] 5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children contract influenza each year. [ 23 ] The reported number of influenza cases is usually much lower than the actual number. [ 1 ] [ 48 ]\\nDuring seasonal epidemics, it is estimated that about 80% of otherwise healthy people who have a cough or sore throat have the flu. [ 1 ] Approximately 30–40% of people hospitalized for influenza develop pneumonia, and about 5% of all severe pneumonia cases in hospitals are due to influenza, which is also the most common cause of ARDS in adults. In children, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are the two most common causes of ARDS. [ 17 ] About 3–5% of children each year develop otitis media due to influenza. [ 10 ] Adults who develop organ failure from influenza and children who have PIM scores and acute renal failure have higher rates of mortality. [ 17 ] During seasonal influenza, mortality is concentrated in the very young and the elderly, whereas during flu pandemics, young adults are often affected at a high rate. [ 13 ]\\nSeasonal risk areas for influenza: November–April (blue), April–November (red), and year-round (yellow)\\nIn temperate regions, the number of influenza cases varies from season to season. Lower vitamin D levels, presumably due to less sunlight, [ 41 ] lower humidity, lower temperature, and minor changes in virus proteins caused by antigenic drift contribute to annual epidemics that peak during the winter season. In the northern hemisphere, this is from October to May (more narrowly December to April [ 13 ] ), and in the southern hemisphere, this is from May to October (more narrowly June to September [ 13 ] ). There are therefore two distinct influenza seasons every year in temperate regions, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] [ 2 ] In tropical and subtropical regions, seasonality is more complex and appears to be affected by various climatic factors such as minimum temperature, hours of sunshine, maximum rainfall, and high humidity. [ 1 ] [ 68 ] Influenza may therefore occur year-round in these regions. [ 13 ] Influenza epidemics in modern times have the tendency to start in the eastern or southern hemisphere, [ 68 ] with Asia being a key reservoir. [ 13 ]\\nInfluenza A virus and influenza B virus co-circulate, so have the same patterns of transmission. [ 1 ] The seasonality of influenza C virus, however, is poorly understood. Influenza C virus infection is most common in children under the age of two, and by adulthood most people have been exposed to it. Influenza C virus-associated hospitalization most commonly occurs in children under the age of three and is frequently accompanied by co-infection with another virus or a bacterium, which may increase the severity of disease. When considering all hospitalizations for respiratory illness among young children, influenza C virus appears to account for only a small percentage of such cases. Large outbreaks of influenza C virus infection can occur, so incidence varies significantly. [ 12 ]\\nOutbreaks of influenza caused by novel influenza viruses are common. [ 30 ] Depending on the level of pre-existing immunity in the population, novel influenza viruses can spread rapidly and cause pandemics with millions of deaths. These pandemics, in contrast to seasonal influenza, are caused by antigenic shifts involving animal influenza viruses. To date, all known flu pandemics have been caused by influenza A viruses, and they follow the same pattern of spreading from an origin point to the rest of the world over the course of multiple waves in a year. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] [ 46 ] Pandemic strains tend to be associated with higher rates of pneumonia in otherwise healthy individuals. [ 17 ] Generally after each influenza pandemic, the pandemic strain continues to circulate as the cause of seasonal influenza, replacing prior strains. [ 1 ] From 1700 to 1889, influenza pandemics occurred about once every 50–60 years. Since then, pandemics have occurred about once every 10–50 years, so they may be getting more frequent over time. [ 68 ]\\nHistory\\nThe main types of influenza viruses in humans. Solid squares show the appearance of a new strain, causing recurring influenza pandemics. Broken lines indicate uncertain strain identifications. [ 69 ]\\nThe first influenza epidemic may have occurred around 6,000 BC in China, [ 70 ] and possible descriptions of influenza exist in Greek writings from the 5th century BC. [ 68 ] [ 71 ] In both 1173–1174 AD and 1387 AD, epidemics occurred across Europe that were named \\\"influenza\\\". Whether these epidemics or others were caused by influenza is unclear since there was then no consistent naming pattern for epidemic respiratory diseases, and \\\"influenza\\\" did not become clearly associated with respiratory disease until centuries later. [ 72 ] Influenza may have been brought to the Americas as early as 1493, when an epidemic disease resembling influenza killed most of the population of the Antilles . [ 73 ] [ 74 ]\\nThe first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was in 1510 . It began in East Asia before spreading to North Africa and then Europe. [ 75 ] Following the pandemic, seasonal influenza occurred, with subsequent pandemics in 1557 and 1580. [ 72 ] The flu pandemic in 1557 was potentially the first time influenza was connected to miscarriage and death of pregnant women. [ 76 ] The 1580 influenza pandemic originated in Asia during summer, spread to Africa, then Europe, and finally America. [ 68 ] By the end of the 16th century, influenza was beginning to become understood as a specific, recognizable disease with epidemic and endemic forms. [ 72 ] In 1648, it was discovered that horses also experience influenza. [ 75 ]\\nInfluenza data after 1700 is more accurate, so it is easier to identify flu pandemics after this point. [ 77 ] The first flu pandemic of the 18th century started in 1729 in Russia in spring, spreading worldwide over the course of three years with distinct waves, the later ones being more lethal. Another flu pandemic occurred in 1781–1782, starting in China in autumn. [ 68 ] From this pandemic, influenza became associated with sudden outbreaks of febrile illness. [ 77 ] The next flu pandemic was from 1830 to 1833, beginning in China in winter. This pandemic had a high attack rate, but the mortality rate was low. [ 34 ] [ 68 ]\\nA minor influenza pandemic occurred from 1847 to 1851 at the same time as the third cholera pandemic and was the first flu pandemic to occur with vital statistics being recorded, so influenza mortality was clearly recorded for the first time. [ 77 ] Fowl plague (now recognised as highly pathogenic avian influenza) was recognized in 1878 [ 77 ] and was soon linked to transmission to humans. [ 75 ] By the time of the 1889 pandemic , which may have been caused by an H2N2 strain, [ 78 ] the flu had become an easily recognizable disease. [ 75 ]\\nThe microbial agent responsible for influenza was incorrectly identified in 1892 by R. F. J. Pfeiffer as the bacteria species Haemophilus influenzae , which retains \\\"influenza\\\" in its name. [ 75 ] [ 77 ] From 1901 to 1903, Italian and Austrian researchers were able to show that avian influenza, then called \\\"fowl plague\\\", [ 35 ] was caused by a microscopic agent smaller than bacteria by using filters with pores too small for bacteria to pass through. The fundamental differences between viruses and bacteria, however, were not yet fully understood. [ 77 ]\\nThe difference between the influenza mortality age distributions of the 1918 epidemic and normal epidemics. Deaths per 100,000 persons in each age group, United States, for the interpandemic years 1911–1917 (dashed line) and the pandemic year 1918 (solid line). [ 79 ]\\nFrom 1918 to 1920, the Spanish flu pandemic became the most devastating influenza pandemic and one of the deadliest pandemics in history. The pandemic, caused by an H1N1 strain of influenza A, [ 80 ] likely began in the United States before spreading worldwide via soldiers during and after the First World War . The initial wave in the first half of 1918 was relatively minor and resembled past flu pandemics, but the second wave later that year had a much higher mortality rate. [ 68 ] A third wave with lower mortality occurred in many places a few months after the second. [ 34 ] By the end of 1920, it is estimated that about a third [ 13 ] to half of all people in the world had been infected, with tens of millions of deaths, disproportionately young adults. [ 68 ] During the 1918 pandemic, the respiratory route of transmission was clearly identified [ 34 ] and influenza was shown to be caused by a \\\"filter passer\\\", not a bacterium, but there remained a lack of agreement about influenza's cause for another decade and research on influenza declined. [ 77 ] After the pandemic, H1N1 circulated in humans in seasonal form [ 1 ] until the next pandemic. [ 77 ]\\nIn 1931, Richard Shope published three papers identifying a virus as the cause of swine influenza, a then newly recognized disease among pigs that was characterized during the second wave of the 1918 pandemic. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] Shope's research reinvigorated research on human influenza, and many advances in virology, serology, immunology, experimental animal models, vaccinology, and immunotherapy have since arisen from influenza research. [ 77 ] Just two years after influenza viruses were discovered, in 1933, influenza A virus was identified as the agent responsible for human influenza. [ 76 ] [ 81 ] Subtypes of influenza A virus were discovered throughout the 1930s, [ 77 ] and influenza B virus was discovered in 1940. [ 23 ]\\nDuring the Second World War , the US government worked on developing inactivated vaccines for influenza, resulting in the first influenza vaccine being licensed in 1945 in the United States. [ 1 ] Influenza C virus was discovered two years later in 1947. [ 23 ] In 1955, avian influenza was confirmed to be caused by influenza A virus. [ 35 ] Four influenza pandemics have occurred since WWII. The first of these was the Asian flu from 1957 to 1958, caused by an H2N2 strain [ 1 ] [ 82 ] and beginning in China's Yunnan province. The number of deaths probably exceeded one million, mostly among the very young and very old. [ 68 ] This was the first flu pandemic to occur in the presence of a global surveillance system and laboratories able to study the novel influenza virus. [ 34 ] After the pandemic, H2N2 was the influenza A virus subtype responsible for seasonal influenza. [ 1 ] The first antiviral drug against influenza, amantadine , was approved in 1966, with additional antiviral drugs being used since the 1990s. [ 4 ]\\nIn 1968, H3N2 was introduced into humans through a rearrangement between an avian H3N2 strain and an H2N2 strain that was circulating in humans. The novel H3N2 strain emerged in Hong Kong and spread worldwide, causing the Hong Kong flu pandemic, which resulted in 500,000–2,000,000 deaths. This was the first pandemic to spread significantly by air travel. [ 3 ] [ 34 ] H2N2 and H3N2 co-circulated after the pandemic until 1971 when H2N2 waned in prevalence and was completely replaced by H3N2. [ 3 ] In 1977, H1N1 reemerged in humans, possibly after it was released from a freezer in a laboratory accident, and caused a pseudo-pandemic . [ 34 ] [ 77 ] This H1N1 strain was antigenically similar to the H1N1 strains that circulated prior to 1957. Since 1977, both H1N1 and H3N2 have circulated in humans as part of seasonal influenza. [ 1 ] In 1980, the classification system used to subtype influenza viruses was introduced. [ 83 ]\\nThermal imaging camera and screen, photographed in an airport terminal in Greece during the 2009 flu pandemic. Thermal imaging can detect elevated body temperature, one of the signs of swine flu.\\nAt some point, influenza B virus diverged into two strains, named the B/Victoria-like and B/Yamagata-like lineages, both of which have been circulating in humans since 1983. [ 23 ]\\nIn 1996, a highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype of influenza A was detected in geese in Guangdong , China [ 35 ] and a year later emerged in poultry in Hong Kong, gradually spreading worldwide from there. A small H5N1 outbreak in humans in Hong Kong occurred then, [ 44 ] and sporadic human cases have occurred since 1997, carrying a high case fatality rate. [ 19 ] [ 62 ]\\nThe most recent flu pandemic was the 2009 swine flu pandemic , which originated in Mexico and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. [ 34 ] It was caused by a novel H1N1 strain that was a reassortment of human, swine, and avian influenza viruses. [ 20 ] [ 4 ] The 2009 pandemic had the effect of replacing prior H1N1 strains in circulation with the novel strain but not any other influenza viruses. Consequently, H1N1, H3N2, and both influenza B virus lineages have been in circulation in seasonal form since the 2009 pandemic. [ 1 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ]\\nIn 2011, influenza D virus was discovered in pigs in Oklahoma, USA, and cattle were later identified as the primary reservoir of influenza D virus. [ 12 ] [ 23 ]\\nIn the same year, [ 62 ] avian H7N9 was detected in China and began to cause human infections in 2013, starting in Shanghai and Anhui and remaining mostly in China. Highly pathogenic H7N9 emerged sometime in 2016 and has occasionally infected humans incidentally. Other avian influenza viruses have less commonly infected humans since the 1990s, including H5N1, H5N5, H5N6 , H5N8 , H6N1 , H7N2 , H7N7 , and H10N7 , and have begun to spread throughout much of the world since the 2010s. [ 19 ] Future flu pandemics, which may be caused by an influenza virus of avian origin, [ 35 ] are viewed as almost inevitable, and increased globalization has made it easier for a pandemic virus to spread, [ 34 ] so there are continual efforts to prepare for future pandemics [ 76 ] and improve the prevention and treatment of influenza. [ 1 ]\\nEtymology\\nThe word influenza comes from the Italian word influenza , from medieval Latin influentia , originally meaning 'visitation' or 'influence'. Terms such as influenza di freddo , meaning 'influence of the cold', and influenza di stelle , meaning 'influence of the stars' are attested from the 14th century. The latter referred to the disease's cause, which at the time was ascribed by some to unfavorable astrological conditions. As early as 1504, influenza began to mean a 'visitation' or 'outbreak' of any disease affecting many people in a single place at once. During an outbreak of influenza in 1743 that started in Italy and spread throughout Europe, the word reached the English language and was anglicized in pronunciation. Since the mid-1800s, influenza has also been used to refer to severe colds. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] The shortened form of the word, \\\"flu\\\", is first attested in 1839 as flue with the spelling flu confirmed in 1893. [ 87 ] Other names that have been used for influenza include epidemic catarrh , la grippe from French , sweating sickness , and, especially when referring to the 1918 pandemic strain, Spanish fever . [ 88 ]\\nIn animals\\nBirds\\nAquatic birds such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls are the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs). [ 19 ] [ 20 ]\\nBecause of the impact of avian influenza on economically important chicken farms, a classification system was devised in 1981 which divided avian virus strains as either highly pathogenic (and therefore potentially requiring vigorous control measures) or low pathogenic. The test for this is based solely on the effect on chickens – a virus strain is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) if 75% or more of chickens die after being deliberately infected with it. The alternative classification is low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) which produces mild or no symptoms. [ 89 ] This classification system has since been modified to take into account the structure of the virus' haemagglutinin protein. [ 90 ] At the genetic level, an AIV can be identified as an HPAI virus if it has a multibasic cleavage site in the HA protein, which contains additional residues in the HA gene. [ 20 ] [ 35 ] Other species of birds, especially water birds, can become infected with HPAI virus without experiencing severe symptoms and can spread the infection over large distances; the exact symptoms depend on the species of bird and the strain of virus. [ 89 ] Classification of an avian virus strain as HPAI or LPAI does not predict how serious the disease might be if it infects humans or other mammals. [ 89 ] [ 91 ]\\nSymptoms of HPAI infection in chickens include lack of energy and appetite, decreased egg production, soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, swelling of the head, comb, wattles, and hocks, purple discoloration of wattles, combs, and legs, nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, incoordination, and diarrhea; birds infected with an HPAI virus may also die suddenly without any signs of infection. [ 61 ] Notable HPAI viruses include influenza A (H5N1) and A (H7N9). HPAI viruses have been a major disease burden in the 21st century, resulting in the death of large numbers of birds. In H7N9's case, some circulating strains were originally low pathogenic but became high pathogenic by mutating to acquire the HA multibasic cleavage site. Avian H9N2 is also of concern because although it is low pathogenic, it is a common donor of genes to H5N1 and H7N9 during reassortment. [ 1 ]\\nMigratory birds can spread influenza across long distances. An example of this was when an H5N1 strain in 2005 infected birds at Qinghai Lake , China, which is a stopover and breeding site for many migratory birds, subsequently spreading the virus to more than 20 countries across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. [ 19 ] [ 35 ] AIVs can be transmitted from wild birds to domestic free-range ducks and in turn to poultry through contaminated water, aerosols, and fomites. [ 1 ] Ducks therefore act as key intermediates between wild and domestic birds. [ 35 ] Transmission to poultry typically occurs in backyard farming and live animal markets where multiple species interact with each other. From there, AIVs can spread to poultry farms in the absence of adequate biosecurity. Among poultry, HPAI transmission occurs through aerosols and contaminated feces, [ 1 ] cages, feed, and dead animals. [ 19 ] Back-transmission of HPAI viruses from poultry to wild birds has occurred and is implicated in mass die-offs and intercontinental spread. [ 20 ]\\nAIVs have occasionally infected humans through aerosols, fomites, and contaminated water. [ 1 ] Direction transmission from wild birds is rare. [ 35 ] Instead, most transmission involves domestic poultry, mainly chickens, ducks, and geese but also a variety of other birds such as guinea fowl, partridge, pheasants, and quails. [ 20 ] The primary risk factor for infection with AIVs is exposure to birds in farms and live poultry markets. [ 19 ] Typically, infection with an AIV has an incubation period of 3–5 days but can be up to 9 days. H5N1 and H7N9 cause severe lower respiratory tract illness, whereas other AIVs such as H9N2 cause a more mild upper respiratory tract illness, commonly with conjunctivitis. [ 1 ] Limited transmission of avian H2, H5-7, H9, and H10 subtypes from one person to another through respiratory droplets, aerosols, and fomites has occurred, but sustained human-to-human transmission of AIVs has not occurred. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]\\nPigs\\nChinese inspectors checking airline passengers for fever, a common symptom of swine flu\\nInfluenza in pigs is a respiratory disease similar to influenza in humans and is found worldwide. Asymptomatic infections are common. Symptoms typically appear 1–3 days after infection and include fever, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, labored breathing, coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge. In sows, pregnancy may be aborted. Complications include secondary infections and potentially fatal bronchopneumonia . Pigs become contagious within a day of infection and typically spread the virus for 7–10 days, which can spread rapidly within a herd. Pigs usually recover within 3–7 days after symptoms appear. Prevention and control measures include inactivated vaccines and culling infected herds. Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2 , and H3N2 are usually responsible for swine flu. [ 92 ]\\nSome influenza A viruses can be transmitted via aerosols from pigs to humans and vice versa. [ 1 ] Pigs, along with bats and quails, [ 23 ] are recognized as a mixing vessel of influenza viruses because they have both α-2,3 and α-2,6 sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tract. Because of that, both avian and mammalian influenza viruses can infect pigs. If co-infection occurs, reassortment is possible. [ 20 ] A notable example of this was the reassortment of a swine, avian, and human influenza virus that caused the 2009 flu pandemic. [ 20 ] [ 4 ] Spillover events from humans to pigs appear to be more common than from pigs to humans. [ 20 ]\\nOther animals\\nInfluenza viruses have been found in many other animals, including cattle, horses, dogs, cats, and marine mammals. Nearly all influenza A viruses are apparently descended from ancestral viruses in birds. The exception are bat influenza-like viruses, which have an uncertain origin. These bat viruses have HA and NA subtypes H17, H18, N10, and N11. H17N10 and H18N11 are unable to reassort with other influenza A viruses, but they are still able to replicate in other mammals. [ 1 ]\\nEquine influenza A viruses include H7N7 and two lineages [ 1 ] of H3N8 . H7N7, however, has not been detected in horses since the late 1970s, [ 30 ] so it may have become extinct in horses. [ 20 ] H3N8 in equines spreads via aerosols and causes respiratory illness. [ 1 ] Equine H3N8 preferentially binds to α-2,3 sialic acids, so horses are usually considered dead-end hosts, but transmission to dogs and camels has occurred, raising concerns that horses may be mixing vessels for reassortment. In canines, the only influenza A viruses in circulation are equine-derived H3N8 and avian-derived H3N2. Canine H3N8 has not been observed to reassort with other subtypes. H3N2 has a much broader host range and can reassort with H1N1 and H5N1. An isolated case of H6N1, likely from a chicken, was found infecting a dog, so other AIVs may emerge in canines. [ 20 ]\\nA wide range of other mammals have been affected by avian influenza A viruses, generally due to eating birds which had been infected. [ 93 ] There have been instances where transmission of the disease between mammals, including seals and cows, may have occurred. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 30 ] Various mutations have been identified that are associated with AIVs adapting to mammals. Since HA proteins vary in which sialic acids they bind to, mutations in the HA receptor binding site can allow AIVs to infect mammals. Other mutations include mutations affecting which sialic acids NA proteins cleave and a mutation in the PB2 polymerase subunit that improves tolerance of lower temperatures in mammalian respiratory tracts and enhances RNP assembly by stabilizing NP and PB2 binding. [ 20 ]\\nInfluenza B virus is mainly found in humans but has also been detected in pigs, dogs, horses, and seals. [ 23 ] Likewise, influenza C virus primarily infects humans but has been observed in pigs, dogs, cattle, and dromedary camels. [ 12 ] [ 23 ] Influenza D virus causes an influenza-like illness in pigs but its impact in its natural reservoir, cattle, is relatively unknown. It may cause respiratory disease resembling human influenza on its own, or it may be part of a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex with other pathogens during co-infection. BRD is a concern for the cattle industry, so influenza D virus' possible involvement in BRD has led to research on vaccines for cattle that can provide protection against influenza D virus. [ 23 ] [ 26 ] Two antigenic lineages are in circulation: D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) and D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 (D/660).

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

Symptoms range from mild to severe and often include fever , runny nose , sore throat , muscle pain , headache , coughing , and fatigue . These symptoms begin one to four (typically two) days after exposure to the virus and last for about two to eight days. Diarrhea and vomiting can occur, particularly in children. Influenza may progress to pneumonia from the virus or a subsequent bacterial infection . Other complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome , meningitis , encephalitis , and worsening of pre-existing health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular disease .\\n There are four types of influenza virus: types A, B, C, and D. Aquatic birds are the primary source of influenza A virus (IAV), which is also widespread in various mammals, including humans and pigs. Influenza B virus (IBV) and influenza C virus (ICV) primarily infect humans, and influenza D virus (IDV) is found in cattle and pigs. Influenza A virus and influenza B virus circulate in humans and cause seasonal epidemics , and influenza C virus causes a mild infection, primarily in children. Influenza D virus can infect humans but is not known to cause illness. In humans, influenza viruses are primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. Transmission through aerosols and surfaces contaminated by the virus also occur.\\n Frequent hand washing and covering one's mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing reduce transmission, as does wearing a mask. Annual vaccination can help to provide protection against influenza. Influenza viruses, particularly influenza A virus, evolve quickly, so flu vaccines are updated regularly to match which influenza strains are in circulation. Vaccines provide protection against influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and one or two influenza B virus subtypes. Influenza infection is diagnosed with laboratory methods such as antibody or antigen tests and a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) to identify viral nucleic acid . The disease can be treated with supportive measures and, in severe cases, with antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir . In healthy individuals, influenza is typically self-limiting and rarely fatal, but it can be deadly in high-risk groups.\\n In a typical year, five to 15 percent of the population contracts influenza. There are 3 to 5 million severe cases annually, with up to 650,000 respiratory-related deaths globally each year. Deaths most commonly occur in high-risk groups, including young children, the elderly, and people with chronic health conditions. In temperate regions , the number of influenza cases peaks during winter, whereas in the tropics , influenza can occur year-round. Since the late 1800s, pandemic outbreaks of novel influenza strains have occurred every 10 to 50 years. Five flu pandemics have occurred since 1900: the Spanish flu from 1918 to 1920, which was the most severe; the Asian flu in 1957; the Hong Kong flu in 1968; the Russian flu in 1977; and the swine flu pandemic in 2009.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nSymptoms of influenza, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] with fever and cough the most common symptoms [ 7 ]\\nThe symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The time between exposure to the virus and development of symptoms (the incubation period ) is one to four days, most commonly one to two days. Many infections are asymptomatic. [ 10 ] The onset of symptoms is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific, including fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain , malaise , loss of appetite , lack of energy, and confusion. These are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough , sore or dry throat , hoarse voice , and a stuffy or runny nose . Coughing is the most common symptom. [ 1 ] Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, [ 11 ] and gastroenteritis, [ 12 ] especially in children. The standard influenza symptoms typically last for two to eight days. [ 13 ] Some studies suggest influenza can cause long-lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]\\nSymptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract , but progression to pneumonia is relatively common. Pneumonia may be caused by the primary viral infection or a secondary bacterial infection . Primary pneumonia is characterized by rapid progression of fever, cough, labored breathing , and low oxygen levels that cause bluish skin . It is especially common among those who have an underlying cardiovascular disease such as rheumatic heart disease . Secondary pneumonia typically has a period of improvement in symptoms for one to three weeks [ 17 ] followed by recurrent fever, sputum production, and fluid buildup in the lungs , [ 1 ] but can also occur just a few days after influenza symptoms appear. [ 17 ] About a third of primary pneumonia cases are followed by secondary pneumonia, which is most frequently caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus . [ 10 ] [ 1 ]\\nVirology\\nTypes of virus\\nInfluenza virus nomenclature (for a Fujian flu virus)\\nInfluenza viruses comprise four species, each the sole member of its own genus. The four influenza genera comprise four of the seven genera in the family Orthomyxoviridae . They are: [ 1 ] [ 18 ]\\nInfluenza A virus , genus Alphainfluenzavirus\\nInfluenza B virus , genus Betainfluenzavirus\\nInfluenza C virus , genus Gammainfluenzavirus\\nInfluenza D virus , genus Deltainfluenzavirus\\nInfluenza A virus is responsible for most cases of severe illness as well as seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. It infects people of all ages but tends to disproportionately cause severe illness in the elderly, the very young, and those with chronic health issues. Birds are the primary reservoir of influenza A virus, especially aquatic birds such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] but the virus also circulates among mammals, including pigs, horses, and marine mammals.\\n Subtypes of Influenza A are defined by the combination of the antigenic viral proteins haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) in the viral envelope ; for example, \\\" H1N1 \\\" designates an IAV subtype that has a type-1 hemagglutinin (H) protein and a type-1 neuraminidase (N) protein. [ 21 ] Almost all possible combinations of H (1 thru 16) and N (1 thru 11) have been isolated from wild birds. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] In addition H17, H18, N10 and N11 have been found in bats. [ 24 ] [ 23 ] The influenza A virus subtypes in circulation among humans are H1N1 and H3N2. [ 2 ]\\nInfluenza B virus mainly infects humans but has been identified in seals, horses, dogs, and pigs. [ 23 ] Influenza B virus does not have subtypes like influenza A virus but has two antigenically distinct lineages, termed the B/Victoria/2/1987-like and B/Yamagata/16/1988-like lineages, [ 1 ] or simply (B/)Victoria(-like) and (B/)Yamagata(-like). [ 23 ] [ 2 ] Both lineages are in circulation in humans, [ 1 ] disproportionately affecting children. [ 11 ] However, the B/Yamagata lineage might have become extinct in 2020/2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic measures. [ 25 ] Influenza B viruses contribute to seasonal epidemics alongside influenza A viruses but have never been associated with a pandemic. [ 23 ]\\nInfluenza C virus, like influenza B virus, is primarily found in humans, though it has been detected in pigs, feral dogs, dromedary camels, cattle, and dogs. [ 12 ] [ 23 ] Influenza C virus infection primarily affects children and is usually asymptomatic [ 1 ] [ 11 ] or has mild cold-like symptoms, though more severe symptoms such as gastroenteritis and pneumonia can occur. [ 12 ] Unlike influenza A virus and influenza B virus, influenza C virus has not been a major focus of research pertaining to antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other measures against influenza. [ 23 ] Influenza C virus is subclassified into six genetic/antigenic lineages. [ 12 ] [ 26 ]\\nInfluenza D virus has been isolated from pigs and cattle, the latter being the natural reservoir. Infection has also been observed in humans, horses, dromedary camels, and small ruminants such as goats and sheep. [ 23 ] [ 26 ] Influenza D virus is distantly related to influenza C virus. While cattle workers have occasionally tested positive to prior influenza D virus infection, it is not known to cause disease in humans. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Influenza C virus and influenza D virus experience a slower rate of antigenic evolution than influenza A virus and influenza B virus. Because of this antigenic stability, relatively few novel lineages emerge. [ 26 ]\\nInfluenza virus nomenclature\\nDiagram of influenza nomenclature\\nEvery year, millions of influenza virus samples are analysed to monitor changes in the virus' antigenic properties, and to inform the development of vaccines. [ 27 ]\\nTo unambiguously describe a specific isolate of virus, researchers use the internationally accepted influenza virus nomenclature, [ 28 ] which describes, among other things, the species of animal from which the virus was isolated, and the place and year of collection. As an example – \\\"A/chicken/Nakorn-Patom/Thailand/CU-K2/04(H5N1)\\\":\\n\\\"A\\\" stands for the genus of influenza ( A , B , C or D ).\\n\\\"chicken\\\" is the animal species the isolate was found in (note: human isolates lack this component term and are thus identified as human isolates by default)\\n\\\"Nakorn-Patom/Thailand\\\" is the place this specific virus was isolated\\n\\\"CU-K2\\\" is the laboratory reference number that identifies it from other influenza viruses isolated at the same place and year\\n\\\"04\\\" represents the year of isolation 2004\\n\\\"H5\\\" stands for the fifth of several known types of the protein hemagglutinin .\\n\\\"N1\\\" stands for the first of several known types of the protein neuraminidase . [ 29 ]\\nThe nomenclature for influenza B, C and D, which are less variable, is simpler. Examples are B/Santiago/29615/2020 and C/Minnesota/10/2015. [ 29 ]\\nGenome and structure\\nStructure of the influenza virion . The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins are shown on the surface of the particle. The viral RNAs that make up the genome are shown as red coils inside the particle and bound to ribonucleoproteins (RNP).\\nInfluenza viruses have a negative-sense , single-stranded RNA genome that is segmented. The negative sense of the genome means it can be used as a template to synthesize messenger RNA (mRNA). [ 10 ] Influenza A virus and influenza B virus have eight genome segments that encode 10 major proteins. Influenza C virus and influenza D virus have seven genome segments that encode nine major proteins. [ 12 ]\\nThree segments encode three subunits of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex: PB1, a transcriptase, PB2, which recognizes 5' caps , and PA (P3 for influenza C virus and influenza D virus), an endonuclease . [ 30 ] The M1 matrix protein and M2 proton channel share a segment, as do the non-structural protein (NS1) and the nuclear export protein (NEP). [ 1 ] For influenza A virus and influenza B virus, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are encoded on one segment each, whereas influenza C virus and influenza D virus encode a hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) protein on one segment that merges the functions of HA and NA. The final genome segment encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP). [ 30 ] Influenza viruses also encode various accessory proteins, such as PB1-F2 and PA-X, that are expressed through alternative open reading frames [ 1 ] [ 31 ] and which are important in host defense suppression, virulence, and pathogenicity. [ 32 ]\\nThe virus particle, called a virion, is pleomorphic and varies between being filamentous, bacilliform, or spherical in shape. Clinical isolates tend to be pleomorphic, whereas strains adapted to laboratory growth typically produce spherical virions. Filamentous virions are about 250 nanometers (nm) by 80 nm, bacilliform 120–250 by 95 nm, and spherical 120 nm in diameter. [ 33 ]\\nThe core of the virion comprises one copy of each segment of the genome bound to NP nucleoproteins in separate ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes for each segment. There is a copy of the RdRp, all subunits included, bound to each RNP. The genetic material is encapsulated by a layer of M1 matrix protein which provides structural reinforcement to the outer layer, the viral envelope . [ 3 ] The envelope comprises a lipid bilayer membrane incorporating HA and NA (or HEF [ 26 ] ) proteins extending outward from its exterior surface. HA and HEF [ 26 ] proteins have a distinct \\\"head\\\" and \\\"stalk\\\" structure. M2 proteins form proton channels through the viral envelope that are required for viral entry and exit. Influenza B viruses contain a surface protein named NB that is anchored in the envelope, but its function is unknown. [ 1 ]\\nLife cycle\\nHost cell invasion and replication by the influenza virus\\nThe viral life cycle begins by binding to a target cell. Binding is mediated by the viral HA proteins on the surface of the envelope, which bind to cells that contain sialic acid receptors on the surface of the cell membrane. [ 1 ] [ 19 ] [ 3 ] For N1 subtypes with the \\\"G147R\\\" mutation and N2 subtypes, the NA protein can initiate entry. Prior to binding, NA proteins promote access to target cells by degrading mucus, which helps to remove extracellular decoy receptors that would impede access to target cells. [ 3 ] After binding, the virus is internalized into the cell by an endosome that contains the virion inside it. The endosome is acidified by cellular vATPase [ 31 ] to have lower pH, which triggers a conformational change in HA that allows fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. [ 32 ] At the same time, hydrogen ions diffuse into the virion through M2 ion channels, disrupting internal protein-protein interactions to release RNPs into the host cell's cytosol . The M1 protein shell surrounding RNPs is degraded, fully uncoating RNPs in the cytosol. [ 31 ] [ 3 ]\\nRNPs are then imported into the nucleus with the help of viral localization signals. There, the viral RNA polymerase transcribes mRNA using the genomic negative-sense strand as a template. The polymerase snatches 5' caps for viral mRNA from cellular RNA to prime mRNA synthesis and the 3'-end of mRNA is polyadenylated at the end of transcription. [ 30 ] Once viral mRNA is transcribed, it is exported out of the nucleus and translated by host ribosomes in a cap-dependent manner to synthesize viral proteins. [ 31 ] RdRp also synthesizes complementary positive-sense strands of the viral genome in a complementary RNP complex which are then used as templates by viral polymerases to synthesize copies of the negative-sense genome. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] During these processes, RdRps of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) function optimally at a higher temperature than mammalian influenza viruses. [ 13 ]\\nNewly synthesized viral polymerase subunits and NP proteins are imported to the nucleus to further increase the rate of viral replication and form RNPs. [ 30 ] HA, NA, and M2 proteins are trafficked with the aid of M1 and NEP proteins [ 32 ] to the cell membrane through the Golgi apparatus [ 30 ] and inserted into the cell's membrane. Viral non-structural proteins including NS1, PB1-F2, and PA-X regulate host cellular processes to disable antiviral responses. [ 1 ] [ 32 ] [ 3 ] PB1-F2 also interacts with PB1 to keep polymerases in the nucleus longer. [ 20 ] M1 and NEP proteins localize to the nucleus during the later stages of infection, bind to viral RNPs and mediate their export to the cytoplasm where they migrate to the cell membrane with the aid of recycled endosomes and are bundled into the segments of the genome. [ 1 ] [ 3 ]\\nProgeny viruses leave the cell by budding from the cell membrane, which is initiated by the accumulation of M1 proteins at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The viral genome is incorporated inside a viral envelope derived from portions of the cell membrane that have HA, NA, and M2 proteins. At the end of budding, HA proteins remain attached to cellular sialic acid until they are cleaved by the sialidase activity of NA proteins. The virion is then released from the cell. The sialidase activity of NA also cleaves any sialic acid residues from the viral surface, which helps prevent newly assembled viruses from aggregating near the cell surface and improving infectivity. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] Similar to other aspects of influenza replication, optimal NA activity is temperature- and pH-dependent. [ 13 ] Ultimately, presence of large quantities of viral RNA in the cell triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death), which is initiated by cellular factors to restrict viral replication. [ 31 ]\\nAntigenic drift and shift\\nEvolution mechanisms of IAV. (A) Antigenic Drift : Gradual accumulation of mutations in the genome of IAVs leads to emergence of new virus variants. (B) Antigenic Shift : The reassortment of genetic segments between two or more invading IAVs in a host cell can lead to emergence of an antigenically novel subtype.\\nTwo key processes that influenza viruses evolve through are antigenic drift and antigenic shift . Antigenic drift is when an influenza virus' antigens change due to the gradual accumulation of mutations in the antigen's (HA or NA) gene. [ 19 ] This can occur in response to evolutionary pressure exerted by the host immune response. Antigenic drift is especially common for the HA protein, in which just a few amino acid changes in the head region can constitute antigenic drift. [ 2 ] [ 26 ] The result is the production of novel strains that can evade pre-existing antibody-mediated immunity. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] Antigenic drift occurs in all influenza species but is slower in B than A and slowest in C and D. [ 26 ] Antigenic drift is a major cause of seasonal influenza, [ 34 ] and requires that flu vaccines be updated annually. HA is the main component of inactivated vaccines, so surveillance monitors antigenic drift of this antigen among circulating strains. Antigenic evolution of influenza viruses of humans appears to be faster than in swine and equines. In wild birds, within-subtype antigenic variation appears to be limited but has been observed in poultry. [ 1 ] [ 11 ]\\nAntigenic shift is a sudden, drastic change in an influenza virus' antigen, usually HA. During antigenic shift, antigenically different strains that infect the same cell can reassort genome segments with each other, producing hybrid progeny. Since all influenza viruses have segmented genomes, all are capable of reassortment. [ 12 ] [ 26 ] Antigenic shift only occurs among influenza viruses of the same genus [ 30 ] and most commonly occurs among influenza A viruses. In particular, reassortment is very common in AIVs, creating a large diversity of influenza viruses in birds, but is uncommon in human, equine, and canine lineages. [ 35 ] Pigs, bats, and quails have receptors for both mammalian and avian influenza A viruses, so they are potential \\\"mixing vessels\\\" for reassortment. [ 23 ] If an animal strain reassorts with a human strain, [ 2 ] then a novel strain can emerge that is capable of human-to-human transmission. This has caused pandemics, but only a limited number, so it is difficult to predict when the next will happen. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] \\nThe Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System of the World Health Organization (GISRS) tests several millions of specimens annually to monitor the spread and evolution of influenza viruses. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 27 ]\\nMechanism\\nTransmission\\nPeople who are infected can transmit influenza viruses through breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing, which spread respiratory droplets and aerosols that contain virus particles into the air. A person susceptible to infection can contract influenza by coming into contact with these particles. [ 17 ] [ 38 ] Respiratory droplets are relatively large and travel less than two meters before falling onto nearby surfaces. Aerosols are smaller and remain suspended in the air longer, so they take longer to settle and can travel further. [ 38 ] [ 4 ] Inhalation of aerosols can lead to infection, [ 39 ] but most transmission is in the area about two meters around an infected person via respiratory droplets [ 10 ] that come into contact with mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. [ 39 ] Transmission through contact with a person, bodily fluids, or intermediate objects ( fomites ) can also occur, [ 10 ] [ 38 ] since influenza viruses can survive for hours on non-porous surfaces. [ 4 ] If one's hands are contaminated, then touching one's face can cause infection. [ 40 ]\\nInfluenza is usually transmissible from one day before the onset of symptoms to 5–7 days after. [ 11 ] In healthy adults, the virus is shed for up to 3–5 days. In children and the immunocompromised, the virus may be transmissible for several weeks. [ 10 ] Children ages 2–17 are considered to be the primary and most efficient spreaders of influenza. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] Children who have not had multiple prior exposures to influenza viruses shed the virus at greater quantities and for a longer duration than other children. [ 1 ] People at risk of exposure to influenza include health care workers, social care workers, and those who live with or care for people vulnerable to influenza. In long-term care facilities, the flu can spread rapidly. [ 11 ] A variety of factors likely encourage influenza transmission, including lower temperature, lower absolute and relative humidity , less ultraviolet radiation from the sun, [ 39 ] [ 41 ] and crowding. [ 38 ] Influenza viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract like H1N1 tend to be more mild but more transmissible, whereas those that infect the lower respiratory tract like H5N1 tend to cause more severe illness but are less contagious. [ 10 ]\\nPathophysiology\\nHow the different sites of infection (shown in red) of H1N1 and H5N1 influences their transmission and lethality [ 42 ]\\nIn humans, influenza viruses first cause infection by infecting epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. Illness during infection is primarily the result of lung inflammation and compromise caused by epithelial cell infection and death, combined with inflammation caused by the immune system's response to infection. Non-respiratory organs can become involved, but the mechanisms by which influenza is involved in these cases are unknown. Severe respiratory illness can be caused by multiple, non-exclusive mechanisms, including obstruction of the airways, loss of alveolar structure, loss of lung epithelial integrity due to epithelial cell infection and death, and degradation of the extracellular matrix that maintains lung structure. In particular, alveolar cell infection appears to drive severe symptoms since this results in impaired gas exchange and enables viruses to infect endothelial cells, which produce large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines . [ 17 ]\\nPneumonia caused by influenza viruses is characterized by high levels of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, accompanied by a strong pro-inflammatory response called a cytokine storm . [ 1 ] Infection with H5N1 or H7N9 especially produces high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. [ 19 ] In bacterial infections, early depletion of macrophages during influenza creates a favorable environment in the lungs for bacterial growth since these white blood cells are important in responding to bacterial infection. Host mechanisms to encourage tissue repair may inadvertently allow bacterial infection. Infection also induces production of systemic glucocorticoids that can reduce inflammation to preserve tissue integrity but allow increased bacterial growth. [ 17 ]\\nThe pathophysiology of influenza is significantly influenced by which receptors influenza viruses bind to during entry into cells. Mammalian influenza viruses preferentially bind to sialic acids connected to the rest of the oligosaccharide by an α-2,6 link, most commonly found in various respiratory cells, [ 1 ] [ 19 ] [ 3 ] such as respiratory and retinal epithelial cells. [ 31 ] AIVs prefer sialic acids with an α-2,3 linkage, which are most common in birds in gastrointestinal epithelial cells [ 1 ] [ 19 ] [ 3 ] and in humans in the lower respiratory tract. [ 43 ] Cleavage of the HA protein into HA 1 , the binding subunit, and HA 2 , the fusion subunit, is performed by different proteases, affecting which cells can be infected. For mammalian influenza viruses and low pathogenic AIVs, cleavage is extracellular, which limits infection to cells that have the appropriate proteases, whereas for highly pathogenic AIVs, cleavage is intracellular and performed by ubiquitous proteases, which allows for infection of a greater variety of cells, thereby contributing to more severe disease. [ 1 ] [ 35 ] [ 44 ]\\nImmunology\\nCells possess sensors to detect viral RNA, which can then induce interferon production. Interferons mediate expression of antiviral proteins and proteins that recruit immune cells to the infection site, and they notify nearby uninfected cells of infection. Some infected cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection. Immune cells control viral infection by killing infected cells and phagocytizing viral particles and apoptotic cells. An exacerbated immune response can harm the host organism through a cytokine storm. [ 1 ] [ 13 ] [ 31 ] To counter the immune response, influenza viruses encode various non-structural proteins, including NS1, NEP, PB1-F2, and PA-X, that are involved in curtailing the host immune response by suppressing interferon production and host gene expression. [ 1 ] [ 32 ]\\nB cells , a type of white blood cell, produce antibodies that bind to influenza antigens HA and NA (or HEF [ 26 ] ) and other proteins to a lesser degree. Once bound to these proteins, antibodies block virions from binding to cellular receptors, neutralizing the virus. In humans, a sizeable antibody response occurs about one week after viral exposure. [ 45 ] This antibody response is typically robust and long-lasting, especially for influenza C virus and influenza D virus. [ 1 ] [ 26 ] People exposed to a certain strain in childhood still possess antibodies to that strain at a reasonable level later in life, which can provide some protection to related strains. [ 1 ] There is, however, an \\\" original antigenic sin \\\", in which the first HA subtype a person is exposed to influences the antibody-based immune response to future infections and vaccines. [ 2 ]\\nPrevention\\nFurther information: Prevention of influenza\\nVaccination\\nMain article: Influenza vaccine\\nGiving an influenza vaccination\\nAnnual vaccination is the primary and most effective way to prevent influenza and influenza-associated complications, especially for high-risk groups. [ 10 ] [ 1 ] [ 46 ] Vaccines against the flu are trivalent or quadrivalent, providing protection against an H1N1 strain, an H3N2 strain, and one or two influenza B virus strains corresponding to the two influenza B virus lineages. [ 10 ] [ 2 ] Two types of vaccines are in use: inactivated vaccines that contain \\\"killed\\\" (i.e. inactivated) viruses and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) that contain weakened viruses. [ 1 ] There are three types of inactivated vaccines: whole virus, split virus, in which the virus is disrupted by a detergent, and subunit, which only contains the viral antigens HA and NA. [ 47 ] Most flu vaccines are inactivated and administered via intramuscular injection. LAIVs are sprayed into the nasal cavity. [ 1 ]\\nVaccination recommendations vary by country. Some recommend vaccination for all people above a certain age, such as 6 months, [ 46 ] whereas other countries limit recommendations to high-risk groups. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] Young infants cannot receive flu vaccines for safety reasons, but they can inherit passive immunity from their mother if vaccinated during pregnancy. [ 48 ] Influenza vaccination helps to reduce the probability of reassortment. [ 13 ]\\nAn Influenza A&B Antigen Test (bottom) showing negative results for both Influenza A and B)\\nIn general, influenza vaccines are only effective if there is an antigenic match between vaccine strains and circulating strains. [ 10 ] [ 2 ] Most commercially available flu vaccines are manufactured by propagation of influenza viruses in embryonated chicken eggs, taking 6–8 months. [ 2 ] Flu seasons are different in the northern and southern hemisphere, so the WHO meets twice a year, once for each hemisphere, to discuss which strains should be included based on observation from HA inhibition assays. [ 10 ] [ 3 ] Other manufacturing methods include an MDCK cell culture-based inactivated vaccine and a recombinant subunit vaccine manufactured from baculovirus overexpression in insect cells. [ 2 ] [ 49 ]\\nAntiviral chemoprophylaxis\\nInfluenza can be prevented or reduced in severity by post-exposure prophylaxis with the antiviral drugs oseltamivir , which can be taken orally by those at least three months old, and zanamivir , which can be inhaled by those above seven years. Chemoprophylaxis is most useful for individuals at high risk for complications and those who cannot receive the flu vaccine. [ 10 ] Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is only recommended if oseltamivir is taken within 48 hours of contact with a confirmed or suspected case and zanamivir within 36 hours. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] It is recommended for people who have yet to receive a vaccine for the current flu season, who have been vaccinated less than two week since contact, if there is a significant mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains, or during an outbreak in a closed setting regardless of vaccination history. [ 11 ]\\nInfection control\\nFurther information: Influenza prevention\\nThese are the main ways that influenza spreads\\nby direct transmission (when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into the eyes, nose or mouth of another person);\\nthe airborne route (when someone inhales the aerosols produced by an infected person coughing, sneezing or spitting);\\nthrough hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose, or hand-to-mouth transmission, either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a hand-shake.\\nWhen vaccines and antiviral medications are limited, non-pharmaceutical interventions are essential to reduce transmission and spread. The lack of controlled studies and rigorous evidence of the effectiveness of some measures has hampered planning decisions and recommendations. Nevertheless, strategies endorsed by experts for all phases of flu outbreaks include hand and respiratory hygiene, self-isolation by symptomatic individuals and the use of face masks by them and their caregivers, surface disinfection, rapid testing and diagnosis, and contact tracing . In some cases, other forms of social distancing including school closures and travel restrictions are recommended. [ 50 ]\\nReasonably effective ways to reduce the transmission of influenza include good personal health and hygiene habits such as: not touching the eyes, nose or mouth; [ 51 ] frequent hand washing (with soap and water, or with alcohol-based hand rubs); [ 52 ] covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or sleeve; avoiding close contact with sick people; and staying home when sick. Avoiding spitting is also recommended. [ 50 ] Although face masks might help prevent transmission when caring for the sick, [ 53 ] [ 54 ] there is mixed evidence on beneficial effects in the community. [ 50 ] [ 55 ] Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as producing more severe disease symptoms. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]\\nSince influenza spreads through both aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces, surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections. [ 58 ] Alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses, while quaternary ammonium compounds can be used with alcohol so that the sanitizing effect lasts for longer. [ 59 ] In hospitals, quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach are used to sanitize rooms or equipment that have been occupied by people with influenza symptoms. [ 59 ] At home, this can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach. [ 60 ]\\nSince influenza viruses circulate in animals such as birds and pigs, prevention of transmission from these animals is important. Water treatment , indoor raising of animals, quarantining sick animals, vaccination, and biosecurity are the primary measures used. Placing poultry houses and piggeries on high ground away from high-density farms, backyard farms, live poultry markets, and bodies of water helps to minimize contact with wild birds. [ 1 ] Closure of live poultry markets appears to the most effective measure [ 19 ] and has shown to be effective at controlling the spread of H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 . [ 20 ] Other biosecurity measures include cleaning and disinfecting facilities and vehicles, banning visits to poultry farms, not bringing birds intended for slaughter back to farms, [ 61 ] changing clothes, disinfecting foot baths, and treating food and water. [ 1 ]\\nIf live poultry markets are not closed, then \\\"clean days\\\" when unsold poultry is removed and facilities are disinfected and \\\"no carry-over\\\" policies to eliminate infectious material before new poultry arrive can be used to reduce the spread of influenza viruses. If a novel influenza viruses has breached the aforementioned biosecurity measures, then rapid detection to stamp it out via quarantining, decontamination, and culling may be necessary to prevent the virus from becoming endemic. [ 1 ] Vaccines exist for avian H5, H7, and H9 subtypes that are used in some countries. [ 19 ] In China, for example, vaccination of domestic birds against H7N9 successfully limited its spread, indicating that vaccination may be an effective strategy [ 35 ] if used in combination with other measures to limit transmission. [ 1 ] In pigs and horses, management of influenza is dependent on vaccination with biosecurity. [ 1 ]\\nDiagnosis\\nX-ray of 29-year-old person with H1N1\\nDiagnosis based on symptoms is fairly accurate in otherwise healthy people during seasonal epidemics and should be suspected in cases of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis , or if encephalitis, myocarditis , or breakdown of muscle tissue occur. [ 17 ] Because influenza is similar to other viral respiratory tract illnesses, laboratory diagnosis is necessary for confirmation. Common sample collection methods for testing include nasal and throat swabs. [ 1 ] Samples may be taken from the lower respiratory tract if infection has cleared the upper but not lower respiratory tract. Influenza testing is recommended for anyone hospitalized with symptoms resembling influenza during flu season or who is connected to an influenza case. For severe cases, earlier diagnosis improves patient outcome. [ 46 ] Diagnostic methods that can identify influenza include viral cultures , antibody- and antigen-detecting tests, and nucleic acid-based tests. [ 62 ]\\nViruses can be grown in a culture of mammalian cells or embryonated eggs for 3–10 days to monitor cytopathic effect. Final confirmation can then be done via antibody staining, hemadsorption using red blood cells , or immunofluorescence microscopy. Shell vial cultures, which can identify infection via immunostaining before a cytopathic effect appears, are more sensitive than traditional cultures with results in 1–3 days. [ 1 ] [ 46 ] [ 62 ] Cultures can be used to characterize novel viruses, observe sensitivity to antiviral drugs, and monitor antigenic drift, but they are relatively slow and require specialized skills and equipment. [ 1 ]\\nSerological assays can be used to detect an antibody response to influenza after natural infection or vaccination. Common serological assays include hemagglutination inhibition assays that detect HA-specific antibodies, virus neutralization assays that check whether antibodies have neutralized the virus, and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assays. These methods tend to be relatively inexpensive and fast but are less reliable than nucleic-acid based tests. [ 1 ] [ 62 ]\\nDirect fluorescent or immunofluorescent antibody (DFA/IFA) tests involve staining respiratory epithelial cells in samples with fluorescently-labeled influenza-specific antibodies, followed by examination under a fluorescent microscope. They can differentiate between influenza A virus and influenza B virus but can not subtype influenza A virus. [ 62 ] Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are a simple way of obtaining assay results, are low cost, and produce results in less than 30 minutes, so they are commonly used, but they can not distinguish between influenza A virus and influenza B virus or between influenza A virus subtypes and are not as sensitive as nucleic-acid based tests. [ 1 ] [ 62 ]\\nNucleic acid-based tests (NATs) amplify and detect viral nucleic acid. Most of these tests take a few hours, [ 62 ] but rapid molecular assays are as fast as RIDTs. [ 46 ] Among NATs, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most traditional and considered the gold standard for diagnosing influenza [ 62 ] because it is fast and can subtype influenza A virus, but it is relatively expensive and more prone to false-positives than cultures. [ 1 ] Other NATs that have been used include loop-mediated isothermal amplification -based assays, simple amplification-based assays, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. Nucleic acid sequencing methods can identify infection by obtaining the nucleic acid sequence of viral samples to identify the virus and antiviral drug resistance. The traditional method is Sanger sequencing , but it has been largely replaced by next-generation methods that have greater sequencing speed and throughput. [ 62 ]\\nManagement\\nMain article: Treatment of influenza\\nTreatment in cases of mild or moderate illness is supportive and includes anti-fever medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen , [ 63 ] adequate fluid intake to avoid dehydration, and rest. [ 11 ] Cough drops and throat sprays may be beneficial for sore throat. It is recommended to avoid alcohol and tobacco use while ill. [ 63 ] Aspirin is not recommended to treat influenza in children due to an elevated risk of developing Reye syndrome . [ 64 ] Corticosteroids are not recommended except when treating septic shock or an underlying medical condition, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma exacerbation, since they are associated with increased mortality. [ 46 ] If a secondary bacterial infection occurs, then antibiotics may be necessary. [ 11 ]\\nAntivirals\\nAntiviral drugs [ 13 ]\\nDrug\\nRoute of administration\\nApproved age of use\\nOseltamivir\\nOral\\nAt least two weeks old\\nZanamivir\\nInhalation\\nAt least five years old\\nPeramivir\\nIntravenous injection\\nAt least 18 years old\\nLaninamivir\\nInhalation [ 1 ]\\n40 milligrams (mg) dose for people at least 10 years old, 20 mg for those under 10 [ 65 ]\\nBaloxavir marboxil\\nOral [ 4 ]\\nAt least 12 years old [ 46 ]\\nAntiviral drugs are primarily used to treat severely ill patients, especially those with compromised immune systems. Antivirals are most effective when started in the first 48 hours after symptoms appear. Later administration may still be beneficial for those who have underlying immune defects, those with more severe symptoms, or those who have a higher risk of developing complications if these individuals are still shedding the virus. Antiviral treatment is also recommended if a person is hospitalized with suspected influenza instead of waiting for test results to return and if symptoms are worsening. [ 1 ] [ 46 ] Most antiviral drugs against influenza fall into two categories: neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors and M2 inhibitors. [ 13 ] Baloxavir marboxil is a notable exception, which targets the endonuclease activity of the viral RNA polymerase and can be used as an alternative to NA and M2 inhibitors for influenza A virus and influenza B virus. [ 10 ] [ 19 ] [ 4 ]\\nNA inhibitors target the enzymatic activity of NA receptors, mimicking the binding of sialic acid in the active site of NA on influenza A virus and influenza B virus virions [ 1 ] so that viral release from infected cells and the rate of viral replication are impaired. [ 11 ] NA inhibitors include oseltamivir, which is consumed orally in a prodrug form and converted to its active form in the liver, and zanamivir, which is a powder that is inhaled nasally. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective for prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis, and research overall indicates that NA inhibitors are effective at reducing rates of complications, hospitalization, and mortality [ 1 ] and the duration of illness. [ 13 ] [ 46 ] [ 4 ] Additionally, the earlier NA inhibitors are provided, the better the outcome, [ 4 ] though late administration can still be beneficial in severe cases. [ 1 ] [ 46 ] Other NA inhibitors include laninamivir [ 1 ] and peramivir, the latter of which can be used as an alternative to oseltamivir for people who cannot tolerate or absorb it. [ 46 ]\\nThe adamantanes amantadine and rimantadine are orally administered drugs that block the influenza virus' M2 ion channel, [ 1 ] preventing viral uncoating. [ 4 ] These drugs are only functional against influenza A virus [ 46 ] but are no longer recommended for use because of widespread resistance to them among influenza A viruses. [ 4 ] Adamantane resistance first emerged in H3N2 in 2003, becoming worldwide by 2008. Oseltamivir resistance is no longer widespread because the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain (H1N1 pdm09), which is resistant to adamantanes, seemingly replaced resistant strains in circulation. Since the 2009 pandemic, oseltamivir resistance has mainly been observed in patients undergoing therapy, [ 1 ] especially the immunocompromised and young children. [ 4 ] Oseltamivir resistance is usually reported in H1N1, but has been reported in H3N2 and influenza B viruss less commonly. [ 1 ] Because of this, oseltamivir is recommended as the first drug of choice for immunocompetent people, whereas for the immunocompromised, oseltamivir is recommended against H3N2 and influenza B virus and zanamivir against H1N1 pdm09. Zanamivir resistance is observed less frequently, and resistance to peramivir and baloxavir marboxil is possible. [ 4 ]\\nPrognosis\\nIn healthy individuals, influenza infection is usually self-limiting and rarely fatal. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Symptoms usually last for 2–8 days. [ 13 ] Influenza can cause people to miss work or school, and it is associated with decreased job performance and, in older adults, reduced independence. Fatigue and malaise may last for several weeks after recovery, and healthy adults may experience pulmonary abnormalities that can take several weeks to resolve. Complications and mortality primarily occur in high-risk populations and those who are hospitalized. Severe disease and mortality are usually attributable to pneumonia from the primary viral infection or a secondary bacterial infection, [ 1 ] [ 11 ] which can progress to ARDS. [ 13 ]\\nOther respiratory complications that may occur include sinusitis , bronchitis , bronchiolitis , excess fluid buildup in the lungs, and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and asthma. Middle ear infection and croup may occur, most commonly in children. [ 10 ] [ 1 ] Secondary S. aureus infection has been observed, primarily in children, to cause toxic shock syndrome after influenza, with hypotension, fever, and reddening and peeling of the skin. [ 1 ] Complications affecting the cardiovascular system are rare and include pericarditis, fulminant myocarditis with a fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat , and exacerbation of pre-existing cardiovascular disease. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Inflammation or swelling of muscles accompanied by muscle tissue breaking down occurs rarely, usually in children, which presents as extreme tenderness and muscle pain in the legs and a reluctance to walk for 2–3 days. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] [ 17 ]\\nInfluenza can affect pregnancy, including causing smaller neonatal size, increased risk of premature birth, and an increased risk of child death shortly before or after birth. [ 11 ] Neurological complications have been associated with influenza on rare occasions, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome . [ 17 ] Additionally, febrile seizures and Reye syndrome can occur, most commonly in children. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] Influenza-associated encephalopathy can occur directly from central nervous system infection from the presence of the virus in blood and presents as sudden onset of fever with convulsions, followed by rapid progression to coma. [ 10 ] An atypical form of encephalitis called encephalitis lethargica, characterized by headache, drowsiness, and coma, may rarely occur sometime after infection. [ 1 ] In survivors of influenza-associated encephalopathy, neurological defects may occur. [ 10 ] Primarily in children, in severe cases the immune system may rarely dramatically overproduce white blood cells that release cytokines, causing severe inflammation. [ 10 ]\\nPeople who are at least 65 years of age, [ 11 ] due to a weakened immune system from aging or a chronic illness, are a high-risk group for developing complications, as are children less than one year of age and children who have not been previously exposed to influenza viruses multiple times. Pregnant women are at an elevated risk, which increases by trimester [ 1 ] and lasts up to two weeks after childbirth. [ 11 ] [ 46 ] Obesity, in particular a body mass index greater than 35–40, is associated with greater amounts of viral replication, increased severity of secondary bacterial infection, and reduced vaccination efficacy. People who have underlying health conditions are also considered at-risk, including those who have congenital or chronic heart problems or lung (e.g. asthma), kidney, liver, blood, neurological, or metabolic (e.g. diabetes ) disorders, [ 10 ] [ 1 ] [ 11 ] as are people who are immunocompromised from chemotherapy, asplenia , prolonged steroid treatment, splenic dysfunction, or HIV infection. [ 11 ] Tobacco use, including past use, places a person at risk. [ 46 ] The role of genetics in influenza is not well researched, [ 1 ] but it may be a factor in influenza mortality. [ 13 ]\\nEpidemiology\\nFurther information: Flu season and Flu pandemics\\nInfluenza mortality in symptomatic cases in the US for the 2018/2019 season [ 66 ]\\nInfluenza is typically characterized by seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. Most of the burden of influenza is a result of flu seasons caused by influenza A virus and influenza B virus. Among influenza A virus subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2 circulate in humans and are responsible for seasonal influenza. Cases disproportionately occur in children, but most severe causes are among the elderly, the very young, [ 1 ] and the immunocompromised. [ 4 ] In a typical year, influenza viruses infect 5–15% of the global population, [ 3 ] [ 62 ] causing 3–5 million cases of severe illness annually [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and accounting for 290,000–650,000 deaths each year due to respiratory illness. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 67 ] 5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children contract influenza each year. [ 23 ] The reported number of influenza cases is usually much lower than the actual number. [ 1 ] [ 48 ]\\nDuring seasonal epidemics, it is estimated that about 80% of otherwise healthy people who have a cough or sore throat have the flu. [ 1 ] Approximately 30–40% of people hospitalized for influenza develop pneumonia, and about 5% of all severe pneumonia cases in hospitals are due to influenza, which is also the most common cause of ARDS in adults. In children, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are the two most common causes of ARDS. [ 17 ] About 3–5% of children each year develop otitis media due to influenza. [ 10 ] Adults who develop organ failure from influenza and children who have PIM scores and acute renal failure have higher rates of mortality. [ 17 ] During seasonal influenza, mortality is concentrated in the very young and the elderly, whereas during flu pandemics, young adults are often affected at a high rate. [ 13 ]\\nSeasonal risk areas for influenza: November–April (blue), April–November (red), and year-round (yellow)\\nIn temperate regions, the number of influenza cases varies from season to season. Lower vitamin D levels, presumably due to less sunlight, [ 41 ] lower humidity, lower temperature, and minor changes in virus proteins caused by antigenic drift contribute to annual epidemics that peak during the winter season. In the northern hemisphere, this is from October to May (more narrowly December to April [ 13 ] ), and in the southern hemisphere, this is from May to October (more narrowly June to September [ 13 ] ). There are therefore two distinct influenza seasons every year in temperate regions, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] [ 2 ] In tropical and subtropical regions, seasonality is more complex and appears to be affected by various climatic factors such as minimum temperature, hours of sunshine, maximum rainfall, and high humidity. [ 1 ] [ 68 ] Influenza may therefore occur year-round in these regions. [ 13 ] Influenza epidemics in modern times have the tendency to start in the eastern or southern hemisphere, [ 68 ] with Asia being a key reservoir. [ 13 ]\\nInfluenza A virus and influenza B virus co-circulate, so have the same patterns of transmission. [ 1 ] The seasonality of influenza C virus, however, is poorly understood. Influenza C virus infection is most common in children under the age of two, and by adulthood most people have been exposed to it. Influenza C virus-associated hospitalization most commonly occurs in children under the age of three and is frequently accompanied by co-infection with another virus or a bacterium, which may increase the severity of disease. When considering all hospitalizations for respiratory illness among young children, influenza C virus appears to account for only a small percentage of such cases. Large outbreaks of influenza C virus infection can occur, so incidence varies significantly. [ 12 ]\\nOutbreaks of influenza caused by novel influenza viruses are common. [ 30 ] Depending on the level of pre-existing immunity in the population, novel influenza viruses can spread rapidly and cause pandemics with millions of deaths. These pandemics, in contrast to seasonal influenza, are caused by antigenic shifts involving animal influenza viruses. To date, all known flu pandemics have been caused by influenza A viruses, and they follow the same pattern of spreading from an origin point to the rest of the world over the course of multiple waves in a year. [ 1 ] [ 11 ] [ 46 ] Pandemic strains tend to be associated with higher rates of pneumonia in otherwise healthy individuals. [ 17 ] Generally after each influenza pandemic, the pandemic strain continues to circulate as the cause of seasonal influenza, replacing prior strains. [ 1 ] From 1700 to 1889, influenza pandemics occurred about once every 50–60 years. Since then, pandemics have occurred about once every 10–50 years, so they may be getting more frequent over time. [ 68 ]\\nHistory\\nThe main types of influenza viruses in humans. Solid squares show the appearance of a new strain, causing recurring influenza pandemics. Broken lines indicate uncertain strain identifications. [ 69 ]\\nThe first influenza epidemic may have occurred around 6,000 BC in China, [ 70 ] and possible descriptions of influenza exist in Greek writings from the 5th century BC. [ 68 ] [ 71 ] In both 1173–1174 AD and 1387 AD, epidemics occurred across Europe that were named \\\"influenza\\\". Whether these epidemics or others were caused by influenza is unclear since there was then no consistent naming pattern for epidemic respiratory diseases, and \\\"influenza\\\" did not become clearly associated with respiratory disease until centuries later. [ 72 ] Influenza may have been brought to the Americas as early as 1493, when an epidemic disease resembling influenza killed most of the population of the Antilles . [ 73 ] [ 74 ]\\nThe first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was in 1510 . It began in East Asia before spreading to North Africa and then Europe. [ 75 ] Following the pandemic, seasonal influenza occurred, with subsequent pandemics in 1557 and 1580. [ 72 ] The flu pandemic in 1557 was potentially the first time influenza was connected to miscarriage and death of pregnant women. [ 76 ] The 1580 influenza pandemic originated in Asia during summer, spread to Africa, then Europe, and finally America. [ 68 ] By the end of the 16th century, influenza was beginning to become understood as a specific, recognizable disease with epidemic and endemic forms. [ 72 ] In 1648, it was discovered that horses also experience influenza. [ 75 ]\\nInfluenza data after 1700 is more accurate, so it is easier to identify flu pandemics after this point. [ 77 ] The first flu pandemic of the 18th century started in 1729 in Russia in spring, spreading worldwide over the course of three years with distinct waves, the later ones being more lethal. Another flu pandemic occurred in 1781–1782, starting in China in autumn. [ 68 ] From this pandemic, influenza became associated with sudden outbreaks of febrile illness. [ 77 ] The next flu pandemic was from 1830 to 1833, beginning in China in winter. This pandemic had a high attack rate, but the mortality rate was low. [ 34 ] [ 68 ]\\nA minor influenza pandemic occurred from 1847 to 1851 at the same time as the third cholera pandemic and was the first flu pandemic to occur with vital statistics being recorded, so influenza mortality was clearly recorded for the first time. [ 77 ] Fowl plague (now recognised as highly pathogenic avian influenza) was recognized in 1878 [ 77 ] and was soon linked to transmission to humans. [ 75 ] By the time of the 1889 pandemic , which may have been caused by an H2N2 strain, [ 78 ] the flu had become an easily recognizable disease. [ 75 ]\\nThe microbial agent responsible for influenza was incorrectly identified in 1892 by R. F. J. Pfeiffer as the bacteria species Haemophilus influenzae , which retains \\\"influenza\\\" in its name. [ 75 ] [ 77 ] From 1901 to 1903, Italian and Austrian researchers were able to show that avian influenza, then called \\\"fowl plague\\\", [ 35 ] was caused by a microscopic agent smaller than bacteria by using filters with pores too small for bacteria to pass through. The fundamental differences between viruses and bacteria, however, were not yet fully understood. [ 77 ]\\nThe difference between the influenza mortality age distributions of the 1918 epidemic and normal epidemics. Deaths per 100,000 persons in each age group, United States, for the interpandemic years 1911–1917 (dashed line) and the pandemic year 1918 (solid line). [ 79 ]\\nFrom 1918 to 1920, the Spanish flu pandemic became the most devastating influenza pandemic and one of the deadliest pandemics in history. The pandemic, caused by an H1N1 strain of influenza A, [ 80 ] likely began in the United States before spreading worldwide via soldiers during and after the First World War . The initial wave in the first half of 1918 was relatively minor and resembled past flu pandemics, but the second wave later that year had a much higher mortality rate. [ 68 ] A third wave with lower mortality occurred in many places a few months after the second. [ 34 ] By the end of 1920, it is estimated that about a third [ 13 ] to half of all people in the world had been infected, with tens of millions of deaths, disproportionately young adults. [ 68 ] During the 1918 pandemic, the respiratory route of transmission was clearly identified [ 34 ] and influenza was shown to be caused by a \\\"filter passer\\\", not a bacterium, but there remained a lack of agreement about influenza's cause for another decade and research on influenza declined. [ 77 ] After the pandemic, H1N1 circulated in humans in seasonal form [ 1 ] until the next pandemic. [ 77 ]\\nIn 1931, Richard Shope published three papers identifying a virus as the cause of swine influenza, a then newly recognized disease among pigs that was characterized during the second wave of the 1918 pandemic. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] Shope's research reinvigorated research on human influenza, and many advances in virology, serology, immunology, experimental animal models, vaccinology, and immunotherapy have since arisen from influenza research. [ 77 ] Just two years after influenza viruses were discovered, in 1933, influenza A virus was identified as the agent responsible for human influenza. [ 76 ] [ 81 ] Subtypes of influenza A virus were discovered throughout the 1930s, [ 77 ] and influenza B virus was discovered in 1940. [ 23 ]\\nDuring the Second World War , the US government worked on developing inactivated vaccines for influenza, resulting in the first influenza vaccine being licensed in 1945 in the United States. [ 1 ] Influenza C virus was discovered two years later in 1947. [ 23 ] In 1955, avian influenza was confirmed to be caused by influenza A virus. [ 35 ] Four influenza pandemics have occurred since WWII. The first of these was the Asian flu from 1957 to 1958, caused by an H2N2 strain [ 1 ] [ 82 ] and beginning in China's Yunnan province. The number of deaths probably exceeded one million, mostly among the very young and very old. [ 68 ] This was the first flu pandemic to occur in the presence of a global surveillance system and laboratories able to study the novel influenza virus. [ 34 ] After the pandemic, H2N2 was the influenza A virus subtype responsible for seasonal influenza. [ 1 ] The first antiviral drug against influenza, amantadine , was approved in 1966, with additional antiviral drugs being used since the 1990s. [ 4 ]\\nIn 1968, H3N2 was introduced into humans through a rearrangement between an avian H3N2 strain and an H2N2 strain that was circulating in humans. The novel H3N2 strain emerged in Hong Kong and spread worldwide, causing the Hong Kong flu pandemic, which resulted in 500,000–2,000,000 deaths. This was the first pandemic to spread significantly by air travel. [ 3 ] [ 34 ] H2N2 and H3N2 co-circulated after the pandemic until 1971 when H2N2 waned in prevalence and was completely replaced by H3N2. [ 3 ] In 1977, H1N1 reemerged in humans, possibly after it was released from a freezer in a laboratory accident, and caused a pseudo-pandemic . [ 34 ] [ 77 ] This H1N1 strain was antigenically similar to the H1N1 strains that circulated prior to 1957. Since 1977, both H1N1 and H3N2 have circulated in humans as part of seasonal influenza. [ 1 ] In 1980, the classification system used to subtype influenza viruses was introduced. [ 83 ]\\nThermal imaging camera and screen, photographed in an airport terminal in Greece during the 2009 flu pandemic. Thermal imaging can detect elevated body temperature, one of the signs of swine flu.\\nAt some point, influenza B virus diverged into two strains, named the B/Victoria-like and B/Yamagata-like lineages, both of which have been circulating in humans since 1983. [ 23 ]\\nIn 1996, a highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype of influenza A was detected in geese in Guangdong , China [ 35 ] and a year later emerged in poultry in Hong Kong, gradually spreading worldwide from there. A small H5N1 outbreak in humans in Hong Kong occurred then, [ 44 ] and sporadic human cases have occurred since 1997, carrying a high case fatality rate. [ 19 ] [ 62 ]\\nThe most recent flu pandemic was the 2009 swine flu pandemic , which originated in Mexico and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. [ 34 ] It was caused by a novel H1N1 strain that was a reassortment of human, swine, and avian influenza viruses. [ 20 ] [ 4 ] The 2009 pandemic had the effect of replacing prior H1N1 strains in circulation with the novel strain but not any other influenza viruses. Consequently, H1N1, H3N2, and both influenza B virus lineages have been in circulation in seasonal form since the 2009 pandemic. [ 1 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ]\\nIn 2011, influenza D virus was discovered in pigs in Oklahoma, USA, and cattle were later identified as the primary reservoir of influenza D virus. [ 12 ] [ 23 ]\\nIn the same year, [ 62 ] avian H7N9 was detected in China and began to cause human infections in 2013, starting in Shanghai and Anhui and remaining mostly in China. Highly pathogenic H7N9 emerged sometime in 2016 and has occasionally infected humans incidentally. Other avian influenza viruses have less commonly infected humans since the 1990s, including H5N1, H5N5, H5N6 , H5N8 , H6N1 , H7N2 , H7N7 , and H10N7 , and have begun to spread throughout much of the world since the 2010s. [ 19 ] Future flu pandemics, which may be caused by an influenza virus of avian origin, [ 35 ] are viewed as almost inevitable, and increased globalization has made it easier for a pandemic virus to spread, [ 34 ] so there are continual efforts to prepare for future pandemics [ 76 ] and improve the prevention and treatment of influenza. [ 1 ]\\nEtymology\\nThe word influenza comes from the Italian word influenza , from medieval Latin influentia , originally meaning 'visitation' or 'influence'. Terms such as influenza di freddo , meaning 'influence of the cold', and influenza di stelle , meaning 'influence of the stars' are attested from the 14th century. The latter referred to the disease's cause, which at the time was ascribed by some to unfavorable astrological conditions. As early as 1504, influenza began to mean a 'visitation' or 'outbreak' of any disease affecting many people in a single place at once. During an outbreak of influenza in 1743 that started in Italy and spread throughout Europe, the word reached the English language and was anglicized in pronunciation. Since the mid-1800s, influenza has also been used to refer to severe colds. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] The shortened form of the word, \\\"flu\\\", is first attested in 1839 as flue with the spelling flu confirmed in 1893. [ 87 ] Other names that have been used for influenza include epidemic catarrh , la grippe from French , sweating sickness , and, especially when referring to the 1918 pandemic strain, Spanish fever . [ 88 ]\\nIn animals\\nBirds\\nAquatic birds such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls are the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs). [ 19 ] [ 20 ]\\nBecause of the impact of avian influenza on economically important chicken farms, a classification system was devised in 1981 which divided avian virus strains as either highly pathogenic (and therefore potentially requiring vigorous control measures) or low pathogenic. The test for this is based solely on the effect on chickens – a virus strain is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) if 75% or more of chickens die after being deliberately infected with it. The alternative classification is low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) which produces mild or no symptoms. [ 89 ] This classification system has since been modified to take into account the structure of the virus' haemagglutinin protein. [ 90 ] At the genetic level, an AIV can be identified as an HPAI virus if it has a multibasic cleavage site in the HA protein, which contains additional residues in the HA gene. [ 20 ] [ 35 ] Other species of birds, especially water birds, can become infected with HPAI virus without experiencing severe symptoms and can spread the infection over large distances; the exact symptoms depend on the species of bird and the strain of virus. [ 89 ] Classification of an avian virus strain as HPAI or LPAI does not predict how serious the disease might be if it infects humans or other mammals. [ 89 ] [ 91 ]\\nSymptoms of HPAI infection in chickens include lack of energy and appetite, decreased egg production, soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, swelling of the head, comb, wattles, and hocks, purple discoloration of wattles, combs, and legs, nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, incoordination, and diarrhea; birds infected with an HPAI virus may also die suddenly without any signs of infection. [ 61 ] Notable HPAI viruses include influenza A (H5N1) and A (H7N9). HPAI viruses have been a major disease burden in the 21st century, resulting in the death of large numbers of birds. In H7N9's case, some circulating strains were originally low pathogenic but became high pathogenic by mutating to acquire the HA multibasic cleavage site. Avian H9N2 is also of concern because although it is low pathogenic, it is a common donor of genes to H5N1 and H7N9 during reassortment. [ 1 ]\\nMigratory birds can spread influenza across long distances. An example of this was when an H5N1 strain in 2005 infected birds at Qinghai Lake , China, which is a stopover and breeding site for many migratory birds, subsequently spreading the virus to more than 20 countries across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. [ 19 ] [ 35 ] AIVs can be transmitted from wild birds to domestic free-range ducks and in turn to poultry through contaminated water, aerosols, and fomites. [ 1 ] Ducks therefore act as key intermediates between wild and domestic birds. [ 35 ] Transmission to poultry typically occurs in backyard farming and live animal markets where multiple species interact with each other. From there, AIVs can spread to poultry farms in the absence of adequate biosecurity. Among poultry, HPAI transmission occurs through aerosols and contaminated feces, [ 1 ] cages, feed, and dead animals. [ 19 ] Back-transmission of HPAI viruses from poultry to wild birds has occurred and is implicated in mass die-offs and intercontinental spread. [ 20 ]\\nAIVs have occasionally infected humans through aerosols, fomites, and contaminated water. [ 1 ] Direction transmission from wild birds is rare. [ 35 ] Instead, most transmission involves domestic poultry, mainly chickens, ducks, and geese but also a variety of other birds such as guinea fowl, partridge, pheasants, and quails. [ 20 ] The primary risk factor for infection with AIVs is exposure to birds in farms and live poultry markets. [ 19 ] Typically, infection with an AIV has an incubation period of 3–5 days but can be up to 9 days. H5N1 and H7N9 cause severe lower respiratory tract illness, whereas other AIVs such as H9N2 cause a more mild upper respiratory tract illness, commonly with conjunctivitis. [ 1 ] Limited transmission of avian H2, H5-7, H9, and H10 subtypes from one person to another through respiratory droplets, aerosols, and fomites has occurred, but sustained human-to-human transmission of AIVs has not occurred. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]\\nPigs\\nChinese inspectors checking airline passengers for fever, a common symptom of swine flu\\nInfluenza in pigs is a respiratory disease similar to influenza in humans and is found worldwide. Asymptomatic infections are common. Symptoms typically appear 1–3 days after infection and include fever, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, labored breathing, coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge. In sows, pregnancy may be aborted. Complications include secondary infections and potentially fatal bronchopneumonia . Pigs become contagious within a day of infection and typically spread the virus for 7–10 days, which can spread rapidly within a herd. Pigs usually recover within 3–7 days after symptoms appear. Prevention and control measures include inactivated vaccines and culling infected herds. Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2 , and H3N2 are usually responsible for swine flu. [ 92 ]\\nSome influenza A viruses can be transmitted via aerosols from pigs to humans and vice versa. [ 1 ] Pigs, along with bats and quails, [ 23 ] are recognized as a mixing vessel of influenza viruses because they have both α-2,3 and α-2,6 sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tract. Because of that, both avian and mammalian influenza viruses can infect pigs. If co-infection occurs, reassortment is possible. [ 20 ] A notable example of this was the reassortment of a swine, avian, and human influenza virus that caused the 2009 flu pandemic. [ 20 ] [ 4 ] Spillover events from humans to pigs appear to be more common than from pigs to humans. [ 20 ]\\nOther animals\\nInfluenza viruses have been found in many other animals, including cattle, horses, dogs, cats, and marine mammals. Nearly all influenza A viruses are apparently descended from ancestral viruses in birds. The exception are bat influenza-like viruses, which have an uncertain origin. These bat viruses have HA and NA subtypes H17, H18, N10, and N11. H17N10 and H18N11 are unable to reassort with other influenza A viruses, but they are still able to replicate in other mammals. [ 1 ]\\nEquine influenza A viruses include H7N7 and two lineages [ 1 ] of H3N8 . H7N7, however, has not been detected in horses since the late 1970s, [ 30 ] so it may have become extinct in horses. [ 20 ] H3N8 in equines spreads via aerosols and causes respiratory illness. [ 1 ] Equine H3N8 preferentially binds to α-2,3 sialic acids, so horses are usually considered dead-end hosts, but transmission to dogs and camels has occurred, raising concerns that horses may be mixing vessels for reassortment. In canines, the only influenza A viruses in circulation are equine-derived H3N8 and avian-derived H3N2. Canine H3N8 has not been observed to reassort with other subtypes. H3N2 has a much broader host range and can reassort with H1N1 and H5N1. An isolated case of H6N1, likely from a chicken, was found infecting a dog, so other AIVs may emerge in canines. [ 20 ]\\nA wide range of other mammals have been affected by avian influenza A viruses, generally due to eating birds which had been infected. [ 93 ] There have been instances where transmission of the disease between mammals, including seals and cows, may have occurred. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 30 ] Various mutations have been identified that are associated with AIVs adapting to mammals. Since HA proteins vary in which sialic acids they bind to, mutations in the HA receptor binding site can allow AIVs to infect mammals. Other mutations include mutations affecting which sialic acids NA proteins cleave and a mutation in the PB2 polymerase subunit that improves tolerance of lower temperatures in mammalian respiratory tracts and enhances RNP assembly by stabilizing NP and PB2 binding. [ 20 ]\\nInfluenza B virus is mainly found in humans but has also been detected in pigs, dogs, horses, and seals. [ 23 ] Likewise, influenza C virus primarily infects humans but has been observed in pigs, dogs, cattle, and dromedary camels. [ 12 ] [ 23 ] Influenza D virus causes an influenza-like illness in pigs but its impact in its natural reservoir, cattle, is relatively unknown. It may cause respiratory disease resembling human influenza on its own, or it may be part of a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex with other pathogens during co-infection. BRD is a concern for the cattle industry, so influenza D virus' possible involvement in BRD has led to research on vaccines for cattle that can provide protection against influenza D virus. [ 23 ] [ 26 ] Two antigenic lineages are in circulation: D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) and D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 (D/660).

Its symptoms typically include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle pain, headaches, and fatigue. Symptoms often manifest suddenly and can lead to more severe complications if left untreated.\\n\\n### Types of Influenza Viruses\\n1. **Influenza A**: Most common and can cause epidemics and pandemics. It infects various animals, including humans and birds, and is responsible for the seasonal flu.\\n2. **Influenza B**: Primarily found in humans; associated with seasonal outbreaks but never leads to pandemics.\\n3. **Influenza C**: Typically causes mild infections and is less common than A or B.\\n4. **Influenza D**: Mainly affects cattle and does not typically infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nThe flu is transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. You can also contract the virus by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching your face.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nSymptoms typically begin one to four days after exposure and can last for two to eight days. In some cases, symptoms may include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Muscle aches\\n- Headache\\n- Fatigue\\n- Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, especially in children\\n\\n### Prevention\\n- Annual flu vaccines are the most effective method of prevention, recommended for all individuals aged six months and older.

The disease is characterized by symptoms that typically manifest suddenly and may lead to severe complications if not treated appropriately. Understanding the nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context of influenza is crucial to mitigating its impact on health.\\n\\n## Types of Influenza Viruses\\nInfluenza viruses are classified into four main types:\\n\\n1. **Influenza A**: This is the most common type of influenza virus and is known to cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics. It can infect various animals, such as birds and pigs, as well as humans. Influenza A is responsible for the most severe illnesses and is often associated with the seasonal flu outbreaks.\\n\\n2. **Influenza B**: Primarily found in humans, influenza B typically causes seasonal outbreaks but does not lead to pandemics. Vaccines for influenza B are included in the annual flu vaccine formulations.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: This type usually leads to mild respiratory infections and occurs less frequently than types A and B. It is not associated with large outbreaks or severe illness.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: Primarily affecting cattle, influenza D does not typically infect humans and thus poses no direct public health threat.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nInfluenza is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can also survive on surfaces, and individuals may become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their face. Understanding these modes of transmission is key to implementing effective preventive measures.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms typically develop one to four days post-exposure and can last from two to eight days. Common symptoms include:\\n\\n- **Fever**\\n- **Cough**\\n- **Sore throat**\\n- **Muscle aches**\\n- **Headache**\\n- **Fatigue**\\n- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Such as diarrhea and vomiting, particularly in children.\\n\\nThe rapid onset of symptoms can be severe, leading to complications if not addressed promptly.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nThe most effective method for preventing influenza is through annual vaccinations. Recommendations include:\\n\\n- **Flu Vaccines**: Recommended for everyone aged six months and older, these vaccines protect against multiple strains of influenza A and B.\\n- **Hygiene Practices**: Frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with infected individuals, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and disinfecting surfaces are effective preventive measures.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreatment for influenza generally includes:\\n\\n- **Supportive Care**: For uncomplicated cases, rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications can alleviate symptoms.\\n- **Antiviral Medications**: Such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be prescribed, particularly for severe cases or in high-risk populations.\\n\\n## Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to serious complications, particularly among high-risk groups, including:\\n\\n- **Pneumonia**\\n- **Bronchitis**\\n- **Sinus and ear infections**\\n- **Exacerbation of chronic medical conditions**.\\n\\nYoung children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health issues are particularly vulnerable to the severe impacts of influenza.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nThe influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics, particularly in temperate climates, peaking during winter months. According to estimates:\\n\\n- Influenza affects approximately 5-15% of the global population annually.\\n- Roughly 3-5 million severe cases are reported each year, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths associated with respiratory diseases caused by the virus.\\n\\nThe 2023-2024 Influenza season estimates indicated that approximately 40 million people were sick, with 28,000 deaths attributed to influenza.\\n\\n## History\\nHistorically, influenza has caused significant pandemics, including:\\n\\n- The Spanish Flu of 1918-1919, which resulted in millions of deaths and altered public health responses worldwide.\\n- The H1N1 pandemic of 2009, leading to renewed focus on vaccination strategies and antiviral treatments.\\n\\nImprovements in vaccination strategies and treatment protocols continue to evolve as we gain more understanding of this viral infection.\\n\\n## Sources for Further Information\\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n- [Wikipedia on Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)\\n\\nThis report encapsulates a comprehensive view of influenza, providing essential insights into its nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context, supported by reputable sources.\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Influenza (Flu) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_5", "context": {"span_id": "0x903e57eb0c83bb75", "trace_id": "0xa7c6aa73de334f6444959be0753e6633"}, "parent_id": "0xf0bc2c67b5615351", "start_time": 1742646600050367842, "end_time": 1742646640173093865, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"896af6ca7ee342eeab388b3e10b9873c\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses that affect the respiratory system, primarily the nose, throat, and lungs.

The disease is characterized by symptoms that typically manifest suddenly and may lead to severe complications if not treated appropriately. Understanding the nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context of influenza is crucial to mitigating its impact on health.\\n\\n## Types of Influenza Viruses\\nInfluenza viruses are classified into four main types:\\n\\n1. **Influenza A**: This is the most common type of influenza virus and is known to cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics. It can infect various animals, such as birds and pigs, as well as humans. Influenza A is responsible for the most severe illnesses and is often associated with the seasonal flu outbreaks.\\n\\n2. **Influenza B**: Primarily found in humans, influenza B typically causes seasonal outbreaks but does not lead to pandemics. Vaccines for influenza B are included in the annual flu vaccine formulations.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: This type usually leads to mild respiratory infections and occurs less frequently than types A and B. It is not associated with large outbreaks or severe illness.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: Primarily affecting cattle, influenza D does not typically infect humans and thus poses no direct public health threat.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nInfluenza is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can also survive on surfaces, and individuals may become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their face. Understanding these modes of transmission is key to implementing effective preventive measures.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms typically develop one to four days post-exposure and can last from two to eight days. Common symptoms include:\\n\\n- **Fever**\\n- **Cough**\\n- **Sore throat**\\n- **Muscle aches**\\n- **Headache**\\n- **Fatigue**\\n- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Such as diarrhea and vomiting, particularly in children.\\n\\nThe rapid onset of symptoms can be severe, leading to complications if not addressed promptly.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nThe most effective method for preventing influenza is through annual vaccinations. Recommendations include:\\n\\n- **Flu Vaccines**: Recommended for everyone aged six months and older, these vaccines protect against multiple strains of influenza A and B.\\n- **Hygiene Practices**: Frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with infected individuals, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and disinfecting surfaces are effective preventive measures.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreatment for influenza generally includes:\\n\\n- **Supportive Care**: For uncomplicated cases, rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications can alleviate symptoms.\\n- **Antiviral Medications**: Such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be prescribed, particularly for severe cases or in high-risk populations.\\n\\n## Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to serious complications, particularly among high-risk groups, including:\\n\\n- **Pneumonia**\\n- **Bronchitis**\\n- **Sinus and ear infections**\\n- **Exacerbation of chronic medical conditions**.\\n\\nYoung children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health issues are particularly vulnerable to the severe impacts of influenza.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nThe influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics, particularly in temperate climates, peaking during winter months. According to estimates:\\n\\n- Influenza affects approximately 5-15% of the global population annually.\\n- Roughly 3-5 million severe cases are reported each year, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths associated with respiratory diseases caused by the virus.\\n\\nThe 2023-2024 Influenza season estimates indicated that approximately 40 million people were sick, with 28,000 deaths attributed to influenza.\\n\\n## History\\nHistorically, influenza has caused significant pandemics, including:\\n\\n- The Spanish Flu of 1918-1919, which resulted in millions of deaths and altered public health responses worldwide.\\n- The H1N1 pandemic of 2009, leading to renewed focus on vaccination strategies and antiviral treatments.\\n\\nImprovements in vaccination strategies and treatment protocols continue to evolve as we gain more understanding of this viral infection.\\n\\n## Sources for Further Information\\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n- [Wikipedia on Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)\\n\\nThis report encapsulates a comprehensive view of influenza, providing essential insights into its nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context, supported by reputable sources.\\n```\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_15", "context": {"span_id": "0x381373365a5b7914", "trace_id": "0xa7c6aa73de334f6444959be0753e6633"}, "parent_id": "0x903e57eb0c83bb75", "start_time": 1742646600057421533, "end_time": 1742646601020592044, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"896af6ca7ee342eeab388b3e10b9873c\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Influenza (Flu) Senior Analyst\\n.

Its symptoms typically include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle pain, headaches, and fatigue. Symptoms often manifest suddenly and can lead to more severe complications if left untreated.\\n\\n### Types of Influenza Viruses\\n1. **Influenza A**: Most common and can cause epidemics and pandemics. It infects various animals, including humans and birds, and is responsible for the seasonal flu.\\n2. **Influenza B**: Primarily found in humans; associated with seasonal outbreaks but never leads to pandemics.\\n3. **Influenza C**: Typically causes mild infections and is less common than A or B.\\n4. **Influenza D**: Mainly affects cattle and does not typically infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nThe flu is transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. You can also contract the virus by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching your face.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nSymptoms typically begin one to four days after exposure and can last for two to eight days. In some cases, symptoms may include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Muscle aches\\n- Headache\\n- Fatigue\\n- Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, especially in children\\n\\n### Prevention\\n- Annual flu vaccines are the most effective method of prevention, recommended for all individuals aged six months and older. Vaccines may include protection against multiple strains of Influenza A & B.\\n- Preventive measures include frequent hand washing, avoid close contact with sick individuals, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing, and disinfecting surfaces.\\n\\n### Treatment\\n- For uncomplicated cases, supportive care (rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications) is sufficient.\\n- Antiviral medications such as oseltamivir and zanamivir may be used, especially in cases of severe illness or at-risk populations.\\n\\n### Complications\\nSevere complications may include pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus and ear infections, and worsening of chronic medical conditions. Influenza can be particularly dangerous for high-risk groups, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health problems.\\n\\n### Epidemiology\\n- Seasonal epidemics occur in temperate climates, usually peaking during winter months. \\n- Globally, influenza affects 5-15% of the population annually, with 3-5 million severe cases reported and 290,000-650,000 deaths tied to respiratory diseases caused by flu.\\n\\n### History\\nNotable influenza pandemics include the Spanish Flu of 1918-1919 (which resulted in millions of deaths) and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

CDC uses mathematical models to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occur and are prevented by vaccination each year 1 2 . The estimates of the burden and prevented burden of influenza in the population in the United States are used to inform policy and communications related to influenza prevention and control, including promoting vaccination as the best way to prevent influenza.\\n2023-2024 Severity Assessment\\nDuring the 2023-2024 season, the severity of the influenza season was classified as moderate, and influenza activity returned to levels seen during seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic for both the timing and intensity of virus activity 3 . Seasonal influenza severity was assessed for three age groups including pediatric (0-17 years), adult (18-64 years), and older adult (≥65 years) and using data for three indicators including the percentage of influenza-like illness visits out of all outpatient visits, the rate of influenza-related hospitalizations, and the percentage of influenza deaths out of all-cause deaths 4 . The 2023-2024 season was classified as moderately severe across all ages and for each age group 5 .\\n2023-2024 Disease Burden Estimates\\nPrevious estimates of disease burden using preliminary hospitalization case and death counts for the 2023-2024 season were reported in the technical report describing the 2023-2024 influenza season 3 . Here updated influenza hospitalizations and deaths along with other updated data sources are used to present the end of season disease burden estimates.\\nUsing information on influenza-confirmed hospitalizations and deaths from October 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024, CDC estimates that 40 million people were sick with influenza, 18 million people visited a healthcare provider for influenza, 470,000 had influenza-related hospitalizations, and 28,000 influenza-related deaths occurred during the 2023-2024 season 6 . While estimates of illnesses related to and medical visits for influenza were similar to those observed during the 2017-2018 season, influenza-related hospitalizations were similar to what was observed during the 2016-2017 season and influenza-related deaths were similar to the 2018-2019 season.\\nCDC's estimates of hospitalizations and deaths associated with influenza during the 2023–2024 season are a reminder that influenza viruses can cause severe disease and death. Older adults aged ≥65 years accounted for only 8% of medical visits for influenza but 68% of deaths and 50% of hospitalizations, which is similar to past seasons. Adults aged 50-64 years accounted for 20% of influenza-related hospitalizations and 20% of influenza-related deaths, and those aged 18-49 years accounted for an additional 20% of influenza-related hospitalizations These findings continue to highlight that older adults are particularly vulnerable to severe disease with influenza virus infection and that influenza prevention measures such as vaccination are important to reducing the impact of seasonal epidemics on the population and healthcare system.\\nDeaths in children with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection have been a reportable disease in the United States since 2004; 205 deaths were reported for the 2023-2024 season as of November 15, 2024 5 . However, influenza -related pediatric deaths are likely under-reported, as not all children whose death was related to an influenza virus infection may have been tested for influenza. We estimate that an additional 521 deaths associated with influenza occurred during the 2023-2024 season among children aged <18 years resulting in an estimated 724 pediatric deaths.\\n2023-2024 Burden Prevented by Vaccination\\nTo estimate the burden prevented by vaccination for the 2023-2024 season, estimates of disease burden, vaccine coverage, and two measures of vaccine effectiveness (VE) were used including VE against outpatient medical visits and VE against hospitalization associated with influenza. Vaccine coverage for influenza vaccination during the 2023-2024 season was lowest (32%) among those aged 18-49 years and highest (69%) among those aged ≥65 years in the United States 7 . Pooled vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related outpatient medical visits from multiple systems varied by age group and was lowest (37%) among those aged ≥65 years and highest (58%) among those aged 6 months to 4 years. Pooled vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related hospitalization from multiple systems was lowest (35%) among those aged ≥65 years and highest (72%) among those aged 6 months to 4 years 8 . During the 2023-2024 season, CDC estimates that influenza vaccination prevented 9.8 million influenza-related illnesses, 4.8 million medical visits, 120,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 7,900 influenza-related deaths.\\nThe number and proportion of influenza-related illnesses, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented by vaccination during 2023–2024 season varied by age group, due to age-specific differences in influenza disease burden, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness. Influenza vaccination prevented the fewest illnesses among adults 65 years and older (8% of illnesses prevented). Despite a relatively high vaccine coverage (69%) in this age group, the vaccine effectiveness for outpatient medical visits (37%) and vaccine effectiveness against hospitalizations (35%) was lowest. Influenza vaccination prevented the highest number of community illnesses (31%) and medically attended illnesses (34%) among children aged 5-17 years, an age group in which vaccine uptake was moderate (53%), and vaccine effectiveness was also moderate (52% against outpatient medical visits, 51% against hospitalization). Conversely, influenza vaccination prevented the highest number of hospitalizations and deaths among older adults aged ≥65 years.\\nConclusion\\nDuring the 2023-2024 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza was associated with 40 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 470,000 hospitalizations, and 28,000 deaths. In addition, influenza vaccination prevented 9.8 million influenza-related illnesses, 4.8 million influenza-related medical visits, 120,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 7,900 influenza-related deaths.\\nDisclaimer:\\nDisease burden estimates for the 2023-2024 influenza season are preliminary and will be updated at least two additional times; however, this report will not be updated.

Its symptoms typically include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle pain, headaches, and fatigue. Symptoms often manifest suddenly and can lead to more severe complications if left untreated.\\n\\n### Types of Influenza Viruses\\n1. **Influenza A**: Most common and can cause epidemics and pandemics. It infects various animals, including humans and birds, and is responsible for the seasonal flu.\\n2. **Influenza B**: Primarily found in humans; associated with seasonal outbreaks but never leads to pandemics.\\n3. **Influenza C**: Typically causes mild infections and is less common than A or B.\\n4. **Influenza D**: Mainly affects cattle and does not typically infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nThe flu is transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. You can also contract the virus by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching your face.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nSymptoms typically begin one to four days after exposure and can last for two to eight days. In some cases, symptoms may include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Muscle aches\\n- Headache\\n- Fatigue\\n- Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, especially in children\\n\\n### Prevention\\n- Annual flu vaccines are the most effective method of prevention, recommended for all individuals aged six months and older. Vaccines may include protection against multiple strains of Influenza A & B.\\n- Preventive measures include frequent hand washing, avoid close contact with sick individuals, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing, and disinfecting surfaces.\\n\\n### Treatment\\n- For uncomplicated cases, supportive care (rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications) is sufficient.\\n- Antiviral medications such as oseltamivir and zanamivir may be used, especially in cases of severe illness or at-risk populations.\\n\\n### Complications\\nSevere complications may include pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus and ear infections, and worsening of chronic medical conditions. Influenza can be particularly dangerous for high-risk groups, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health problems.\\n\\n### Epidemiology\\n- Seasonal epidemics occur in temperate climates, usually peaking during winter months. \\n- Globally, influenza affects 5-15% of the population annually, with 3-5 million severe cases reported and 290,000-650,000 deaths tied to respiratory diseases caused by flu.\\n\\n### History\\nNotable influenza pandemics include the Spanish Flu of 1918-1919 (which resulted in millions of deaths) and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Vaccination strategies and antiviral therapies have evolved over time to combat this infectious disease.\\n\\n### Sources for Further Information\\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n- [Wikipedia on Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)\\n\\nThis aggregated information provides a comprehensive view of influenza, covering its nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context, supported by reputable sources.\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

Here updated influenza hospitalizations and deaths along with other updated data sources are used to present the end of season disease burden estimates.\\nUsing information on influenza-confirmed hospitalizations and deaths from October 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024, CDC estimates that 40 million people were sick with influenza, 18 million people visited a healthcare provider for influenza, 470,000 had influenza-related hospitalizations, and 28,000 influenza-related deaths occurred during the 2023-2024 season 6 . While estimates of illnesses related to and medical visits for influenza were similar to those observed during the 2017-2018 season, influenza-related hospitalizations were similar to what was observed during the 2016-2017 season and influenza-related deaths were similar to the 2018-2019 season.\\nCDC's estimates of hospitalizations and deaths associated with influenza during the 2023–2024 season are a reminder that influenza viruses can cause severe disease and death. Older adults aged ≥65 years accounted for only 8% of medical visits for influenza but 68% of deaths and 50% of hospitalizations, which is similar to past seasons. Adults aged 50-64 years accounted for 20% of influenza-related hospitalizations and 20% of influenza-related deaths, and those aged 18-49 years accounted for an additional 20% of influenza-related hospitalizations These findings continue to highlight that older adults are particularly vulnerable to severe disease with influenza virus infection and that influenza prevention measures such as vaccination are important to reducing the impact of seasonal epidemics on the population and healthcare system.\\nDeaths in children with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection have been a reportable disease in the United States since 2004; 205 deaths were reported for the 2023-2024 season as of November 15, 2024 5 . However, influenza -related pediatric deaths are likely under-reported, as not all children whose death was related to an influenza virus infection may have been tested for influenza. We estimate that an additional 521 deaths associated with influenza occurred during the 2023-2024 season among children aged <18 years resulting in an estimated 724 pediatric deaths.\\n2023-2024 Burden Prevented by Vaccination\\nTo estimate the burden prevented by vaccination for the 2023-2024 season, estimates of disease burden, vaccine coverage, and two measures of vaccine effectiveness (VE) were used including VE against outpatient medical visits and VE against hospitalization associated with influenza. Vaccine coverage for influenza vaccination during the 2023-2024 season was lowest (32%) among those aged 18-49 years and highest (69%) among those aged ≥65 years in the United States 7 . Pooled vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related outpatient medical visits from multiple systems varied by age group and was lowest (37%) among those aged ≥65 years and highest (58%) among those aged 6 months to 4 years. Pooled vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related hospitalization from multiple systems was lowest (35%) among those aged ≥65 years and highest (72%) among those aged 6 months to 4 years 8 . During the 2023-2024 season, CDC estimates that influenza vaccination prevented 9.8 million influenza-related illnesses, 4.8 million medical visits, 120,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 7,900 influenza-related deaths.\\nThe number and proportion of influenza-related illnesses, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented by vaccination during 2023–2024 season varied by age group, due to age-specific differences in influenza disease burden, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness. Influenza vaccination prevented the fewest illnesses among adults 65 years and older (8% of illnesses prevented). Despite a relatively high vaccine coverage (69%) in this age group, the vaccine effectiveness for outpatient medical visits (37%) and vaccine effectiveness against hospitalizations (35%) was lowest. Influenza vaccination prevented the highest number of community illnesses (31%) and medically attended illnesses (34%) among children aged 5-17 years, an age group in which vaccine uptake was moderate (53%), and vaccine effectiveness was also moderate (52% against outpatient medical visits, 51% against hospitalization). Conversely, influenza vaccination prevented the highest number of hospitalizations and deaths among older adults aged ≥65 years.\\nConclusion\\nDuring the 2023-2024 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza was associated with 40 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 470,000 hospitalizations, and 28,000 deaths. In addition, influenza vaccination prevented 9.8 million influenza-related illnesses, 4.8 million influenza-related medical visits, 120,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 7,900 influenza-related deaths.\\nDisclaimer:\\nDisease burden estimates for the 2023-2024 influenza season are preliminary and will be updated at least two additional times; however, this report will not be updated.

Typical symptoms of the flu include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. Symptoms can occur suddenly and may vary in severity.\\n\\n## Types of Influenza Viruses\\n\\nInfluenza viruses are classified into four main types: \\n\\n1. **Influenza A**: This is the most common type and is capable of causing both epidemics and pandemics. Influenza A viruses can infect various animal species, including humans and birds, making it a key player in seasonal flu outbreaks.\\n\\n2. **Influenza B**: This virus primarily affects humans and is associated with seasonal epidemics. It does not lead to pandemics, making it less concerning than Influenza A.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: Generally known for causing milder respiratory illness, Influenza C is less common compared to types A and B and usually leads to mild disease.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: This type mainly affects cattle and is not typically known to infect humans. \\n\\n## Transmission\\n\\nInfluenza is primarily spread through respiratory droplets released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can also be contracted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and subsequently touching the face.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nFlu symptoms typically develop one to four days following exposure and can persist for two to eight days. Common symptoms include:\\n\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Muscle aches\\n- Headache\\n- Fatigue\\n- Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting, particularly in children.\\n\\n## Prevention\\n\\nThe most effective method of preventing influenza is through annual vaccinations, which are recommended for everyone aged six months and older. Vaccines may offer protection against multiple strains of Influenza A and B. Other preventive measures include:\\n\\n- Frequent hand washing\\n- Avoiding close contact with individuals who are sick\\n- Covering the mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing\\n- Disinfecting surfaces regularly.\\n\\n## Treatment\\n\\nFor uncomplicated cases, supportive care such as rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications is generally sufficient. Antiviral medications, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, may be prescribed in more severe cases or for at-risk populations.\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nInfluenza can lead to severe complications, including pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus and ear infections, and exacerbation of chronic medical conditions. Certain groups are particularly at risk, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health issues.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\n\\nSeasonal influenza epidemics are common in temperate climates, peaking during the winter months.

CDC uses mathematical models to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occur and are prevented by vaccination each year 1 2 . The estimates of the burden and prevented burden of influenza in the population in the United States are used to inform policy and communications related to influenza prevention and control, including promoting vaccination as the best way to prevent influenza.\\n2023-2024 Severity Assessment\\nDuring the 2023-2024 season, the severity of the influenza season was classified as moderate, and influenza activity returned to levels seen during seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic for both the timing and intensity of virus activity 3 . Seasonal influenza severity was assessed for three age groups including pediatric (0-17 years), adult (18-64 years), and older adult (≥65 years) and using data for three indicators including the percentage of influenza-like illness visits out of all outpatient visits, the rate of influenza-related hospitalizations, and the percentage of influenza deaths out of all-cause deaths 4 . The 2023-2024 season was classified as moderately severe across all ages and for each age group 5 .\\n2023-2024 Disease Burden Estimates\\nPrevious estimates of disease burden using preliminary hospitalization case and death counts for the 2023-2024 season were reported in the technical report describing the 2023-2024 influenza season 3 . Here updated influenza hospitalizations and deaths along with other updated data sources are used to present the end of season disease burden estimates.\\nUsing information on influenza-confirmed hospitalizations and deaths from October 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024, CDC estimates that 40 million people were sick with influenza, 18 million people visited a healthcare provider for influenza, 470,000 had influenza-related hospitalizations, and 28,000 influenza-related deaths occurred during the 2023-2024 season 6 . While estimates of illnesses related to and medical visits for influenza were similar to those observed during the 2017-2018 season, influenza-related hospitalizations were similar to what was observed during the 2016-2017 season and influenza-related deaths were similar to the 2018-2019 season.\\nCDC's estimates of hospitalizations and deaths associated with influenza during the 2023–2024 season are a reminder that influenza viruses can cause severe disease and death. Older adults aged ≥65 years accounted for only 8% of medical visits for influenza but 68% of deaths and 50% of hospitalizations, which is similar to past seasons. Adults aged 50-64 years accounted for 20% of influenza-related hospitalizations and 20% of influenza-related deaths, and those aged 18-49 years accounted for an additional 20% of influenza-related hospitalizations These findings continue to highlight that older adults are particularly vulnerable to severe disease with influenza virus infection and that influenza prevention measures such as vaccination are important to reducing the impact of seasonal epidemics on the population and healthcare system.\\nDeaths in children with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection have been a reportable disease in the United States since 2004; 205 deaths were reported for the 2023-2024 season as of November 15, 2024 5 . However, influenza -related pediatric deaths are likely under-reported, as not all children whose death was related to an influenza virus infection may have been tested for influenza. We estimate that an additional 521 deaths associated with influenza occurred during the 2023-2024 season among children aged <18 years resulting in an estimated 724 pediatric deaths.\\n2023-2024 Burden Prevented by Vaccination\\nTo estimate the burden prevented by vaccination for the 2023-2024 season, estimates of disease burden, vaccine coverage, and two measures of vaccine effectiveness (VE) were used including VE against outpatient medical visits and VE against hospitalization associated with influenza. Vaccine coverage for influenza vaccination during the 2023-2024 season was lowest (32%) among those aged 18-49 years and highest (69%) among those aged ≥65 years in the United States 7 . Pooled vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related outpatient medical visits from multiple systems varied by age group and was lowest (37%) among those aged ≥65 years and highest (58%) among those aged 6 months to 4 years. Pooled vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related hospitalization from multiple systems was lowest (35%) among those aged ≥65 years and highest (72%) among those aged 6 months to 4 years 8 . During the 2023-2024 season, CDC estimates that influenza vaccination prevented 9.8 million influenza-related illnesses, 4.8 million medical visits, 120,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 7,900 influenza-related deaths.\\nThe number and proportion of influenza-related illnesses, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented by vaccination during 2023–2024 season varied by age group, due to age-specific differences in influenza disease burden, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness. Influenza vaccination prevented the fewest illnesses among adults 65 years and older (8% of illnesses prevented). Despite a relatively high vaccine coverage (69%) in this age group, the vaccine effectiveness for outpatient medical visits (37%) and vaccine effectiveness against hospitalizations (35%) was lowest. Influenza vaccination prevented the highest number of community illnesses (31%) and medically attended illnesses (34%) among children aged 5-17 years, an age group in which vaccine uptake was moderate (53%), and vaccine effectiveness was also moderate (52% against outpatient medical visits, 51% against hospitalization). Conversely, influenza vaccination prevented the highest number of hospitalizations and deaths among older adults aged ≥65 years.\\nConclusion\\nDuring the 2023-2024 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza was associated with 40 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 470,000 hospitalizations, and 28,000 deaths. In addition, influenza vaccination prevented 9.8 million influenza-related illnesses, 4.8 million influenza-related medical visits, 120,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 7,900 influenza-related deaths.\\nDisclaimer:\\nDisease burden estimates for the 2023-2024 influenza season are preliminary and will be updated at least two additional times; however, this report will not be updated.

Its symptoms typically include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle pain, headaches, and fatigue. Symptoms often manifest suddenly and can lead to more severe complications if left untreated.\\n\\n### Types of Influenza Viruses\\n1. **Influenza A**: Most common and can cause epidemics and pandemics. It infects various animals, including humans and birds, and is responsible for the seasonal flu.\\n2. **Influenza B**: Primarily found in humans; associated with seasonal outbreaks but never leads to pandemics.\\n3. **Influenza C**: Typically causes mild infections and is less common than A or B.\\n4. **Influenza D**: Mainly affects cattle and does not typically infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nThe flu is transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. You can also contract the virus by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching your face.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nSymptoms typically begin one to four days after exposure and can last for two to eight days. In some cases, symptoms may include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Muscle aches\\n- Headache\\n- Fatigue\\n- Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, especially in children\\n\\n### Prevention\\n- Annual flu vaccines are the most effective method of prevention, recommended for all individuals aged six months and older. Vaccines may include protection against multiple strains of Influenza A & B.\\n- Preventive measures include frequent hand washing, avoid close contact with sick individuals, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing, and disinfecting surfaces.\\n\\n### Treatment\\n- For uncomplicated cases, supportive care (rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications) is sufficient.\\n- Antiviral medications such as oseltamivir and zanamivir may be used, especially in cases of severe illness or at-risk populations.\\n\\n### Complications\\nSevere complications may include pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus and ear infections, and worsening of chronic medical conditions. Influenza can be particularly dangerous for high-risk groups, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health problems.\\n\\n### Epidemiology\\n- Seasonal epidemics occur in temperate climates, usually peaking during winter months. \\n- Globally, influenza affects 5-15% of the population annually, with 3-5 million severe cases reported and 290,000-650,000 deaths tied to respiratory diseases caused by flu.\\n\\n### History\\nNotable influenza pandemics include the Spanish Flu of 1918-1919 (which resulted in millions of deaths) and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Vaccination strategies and antiviral therapies have evolved over time to combat this infectious disease.\\n\\n### Sources for Further Information\\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n- [Wikipedia on Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)\\n\\nThis aggregated information provides a comprehensive view of influenza, covering its nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context, supported by reputable sources.\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

While estimates of illnesses related to and medical visits for influenza were similar to those observed during the 2017-2018 season, influenza-related hospitalizations were similar to what was observed during the 2016-2017 season and influenza-related deaths were similar to the 2018-2019 season.\\nCDC's estimates of hospitalizations and deaths associated with influenza during the 2023–2024 season are a reminder that influenza viruses can cause severe disease and death. Older adults aged ≥65 years accounted for only 8% of medical visits for influenza but 68% of deaths and 50% of hospitalizations, which is similar to past seasons. Adults aged 50-64 years accounted for 20% of influenza-related hospitalizations and 20% of influenza-related deaths, and those aged 18-49 years accounted for an additional 20% of influenza-related hospitalizations These findings continue to highlight that older adults are particularly vulnerable to severe disease with influenza virus infection and that influenza prevention measures such as vaccination are important to reducing the impact of seasonal epidemics on the population and healthcare system.\\nDeaths in children with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection have been a reportable disease in the United States since 2004; 205 deaths were reported for the 2023-2024 season as of November 15, 2024 5 . However, influenza -related pediatric deaths are likely under-reported, as not all children whose death was related to an influenza virus infection may have been tested for influenza. We estimate that an additional 521 deaths associated with influenza occurred during the 2023-2024 season among children aged <18 years resulting in an estimated 724 pediatric deaths.\\n2023-2024 Burden Prevented by Vaccination\\nTo estimate the burden prevented by vaccination for the 2023-2024 season, estimates of disease burden, vaccine coverage, and two measures of vaccine effectiveness (VE) were used including VE against outpatient medical visits and VE against hospitalization associated with influenza. Vaccine coverage for influenza vaccination during the 2023-2024 season was lowest (32%) among those aged 18-49 years and highest (69%) among those aged ≥65 years in the United States 7 . Pooled vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related outpatient medical visits from multiple systems varied by age group and was lowest (37%) among those aged ≥65 years and highest (58%) among those aged 6 months to 4 years. Pooled vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related hospitalization from multiple systems was lowest (35%) among those aged ≥65 years and highest (72%) among those aged 6 months to 4 years 8 . During the 2023-2024 season, CDC estimates that influenza vaccination prevented 9.8 million influenza-related illnesses, 4.8 million medical visits, 120,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 7,900 influenza-related deaths.\\nThe number and proportion of influenza-related illnesses, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented by vaccination during 2023–2024 season varied by age group, due to age-specific differences in influenza disease burden, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness. Influenza vaccination prevented the fewest illnesses among adults 65 years and older (8% of illnesses prevented). Despite a relatively high vaccine coverage (69%) in this age group, the vaccine effectiveness for outpatient medical visits (37%) and vaccine effectiveness against hospitalizations (35%) was lowest. Influenza vaccination prevented the highest number of community illnesses (31%) and medically attended illnesses (34%) among children aged 5-17 years, an age group in which vaccine uptake was moderate (53%), and vaccine effectiveness was also moderate (52% against outpatient medical visits, 51% against hospitalization). Conversely, influenza vaccination prevented the highest number of hospitalizations and deaths among older adults aged ≥65 years.\\nConclusion\\nDuring the 2023-2024 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza was associated with 40 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 470,000 hospitalizations, and 28,000 deaths. In addition, influenza vaccination prevented 9.8 million influenza-related illnesses, 4.8 million influenza-related medical visits, 120,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 7,900 influenza-related deaths.\\nDisclaimer:\\nDisease burden estimates for the 2023-2024 influenza season are preliminary and will be updated at least two additional times; however, this report will not be updated.

The disease is characterized by symptoms that typically manifest suddenly and may lead to severe complications if not treated appropriately. Understanding the nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context of influenza is crucial to mitigating its impact on health.\\n\\n## Types of Influenza Viruses\\nInfluenza viruses are classified into four main types:\\n\\n1. **Influenza A**: This is the most common type of influenza virus and is known to cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics. It can infect various animals, such as birds and pigs, as well as humans. Influenza A is responsible for the most severe illnesses and is often associated with the seasonal flu outbreaks.\\n\\n2. **Influenza B**: Primarily found in humans, influenza B typically causes seasonal outbreaks but does not lead to pandemics. Vaccines for influenza B are included in the annual flu vaccine formulations.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: This type usually leads to mild respiratory infections and occurs less frequently than types A and B. It is not associated with large outbreaks or severe illness.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: Primarily affecting cattle, influenza D does not typically infect humans and thus poses no direct public health threat.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nInfluenza is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can also survive on surfaces, and individuals may become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their face. Understanding these modes of transmission is key to implementing effective preventive measures.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms typically develop one to four days post-exposure and can last from two to eight days. Common symptoms include:\\n\\n- **Fever**\\n- **Cough**\\n- **Sore throat**\\n- **Muscle aches**\\n- **Headache**\\n- **Fatigue**\\n- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Such as diarrhea and vomiting, particularly in children.\\n\\nThe rapid onset of symptoms can be severe, leading to complications if not addressed promptly.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nThe most effective method for preventing influenza is through annual vaccinations. Recommendations include:\\n\\n- **Flu Vaccines**: Recommended for everyone aged six months and older, these vaccines protect against multiple strains of influenza A and B.\\n- **Hygiene Practices**: Frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with infected individuals, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and disinfecting surfaces are effective preventive measures.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreatment for influenza generally includes:\\n\\n- **Supportive Care**: For uncomplicated cases, rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications can alleviate symptoms.\\n- **Antiviral Medications**: Such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be prescribed, particularly for severe cases or in high-risk populations.\\n\\n## Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to serious complications, particularly among high-risk groups, including:\\n\\n- **Pneumonia**\\n- **Bronchitis**\\n- **Sinus and ear infections**\\n- **Exacerbation of chronic medical conditions**.\\n\\nYoung children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health issues are particularly vulnerable to the severe impacts of influenza.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nThe influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics, particularly in temperate climates, peaking during winter months. According to estimates:\\n\\n- Influenza affects approximately 5-15% of the global population annually.\\n- Roughly 3-5 million severe cases are reported each year, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths associated with respiratory diseases caused by the virus.\\n\\nThe 2023-2024 Influenza season estimates indicated that approximately 40 million people were sick, with 28,000 deaths attributed to influenza.\\n\\n## History\\nHistorically, influenza has caused significant pandemics, including:\\n\\n- The Spanish Flu of 1918-1919, which resulted in millions of deaths and altered public health responses worldwide.\\n- The H1N1 pandemic of 2009, leading to renewed focus on vaccination strategies and antiviral treatments.\\n\\nImprovements in vaccination strategies and treatment protocols continue to evolve as we gain more understanding of this viral infection.\\n\\n## Sources for Further Information\\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n- [Wikipedia on Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)\\n\\nThis report encapsulates a comprehensive view of influenza, providing essential insights into its nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context, supported by reputable sources.\\n```\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"```\\nThought: I now can give a great answer\\nFinal Answer: \\n\\n# Comprehensive Report on Influenza (Flu)\\n\\n## Introduction\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses that primarily affect the respiratory systems, including the nose, throat, and lungs.

Its symptoms typically include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle pain, headaches, and fatigue. Symptoms often manifest suddenly and can lead to more severe complications if left untreated.\\n\\n### Types of Influenza Viruses\\n1. **Influenza A**: Most common and can cause epidemics and pandemics. It infects various animals, including humans and birds, and is responsible for the seasonal flu.\\n2. **Influenza B**: Primarily found in humans; associated with seasonal outbreaks but never leads to pandemics.\\n3. **Influenza C**: Typically causes mild infections and is less common than A or B.\\n4. **Influenza D**: Mainly affects cattle and does not typically infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nThe flu is transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. You can also contract the virus by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching your face.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nSymptoms typically begin one to four days after exposure and can last for two to eight days. In some cases, symptoms may include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Muscle aches\\n- Headache\\n- Fatigue\\n- Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, especially in children\\n\\n### Prevention\\n- Annual flu vaccines are the most effective method of prevention, recommended for all individuals aged six months and older.

The disease is characterized by symptoms that typically manifest suddenly and may lead to severe complications if not treated appropriately. Understanding the nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context of influenza is crucial to mitigating its impact on health.\\n\\n## Types of Influenza Viruses\\nInfluenza viruses are classified into four main types:\\n\\n1. **Influenza A**: This is the most common type of influenza virus and is known to cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics. It can infect various animals, such as birds and pigs, as well as humans. Influenza A is responsible for the most severe illnesses and is often associated with the seasonal flu outbreaks.\\n\\n2. **Influenza B**: Primarily found in humans, influenza B typically causes seasonal outbreaks but does not lead to pandemics. Vaccines for influenza B are included in the annual flu vaccine formulations.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: This type usually leads to mild respiratory infections and occurs less frequently than types A and B. It is not associated with large outbreaks or severe illness.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: Primarily affecting cattle, influenza D does not typically infect humans and thus poses no direct public health threat.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nInfluenza is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can also survive on surfaces, and individuals may become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their face. Understanding these modes of transmission is key to implementing effective preventive measures.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms typically develop one to four days post-exposure and can last from two to eight days. Common symptoms include:\\n\\n- **Fever**\\n- **Cough**\\n- **Sore throat**\\n- **Muscle aches**\\n- **Headache**\\n- **Fatigue**\\n- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Such as diarrhea and vomiting, particularly in children.\\n\\nThe rapid onset of symptoms can be severe, leading to complications if not addressed promptly.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nThe most effective method for preventing influenza is through annual vaccinations. Recommendations include:\\n\\n- **Flu Vaccines**: Recommended for everyone aged six months and older, these vaccines protect against multiple strains of influenza A and B.\\n- **Hygiene Practices**: Frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with infected individuals, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and disinfecting surfaces are effective preventive measures.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreatment for influenza generally includes:\\n\\n- **Supportive Care**: For uncomplicated cases, rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications can alleviate symptoms.\\n- **Antiviral Medications**: Such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be prescribed, particularly for severe cases or in high-risk populations.\\n\\n## Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to serious complications, particularly among high-risk groups, including:\\n\\n- **Pneumonia**\\n- **Bronchitis**\\n- **Sinus and ear infections**\\n- **Exacerbation of chronic medical conditions**.\\n\\nYoung children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health issues are particularly vulnerable to the severe impacts of influenza.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nThe influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics, particularly in temperate climates, peaking during winter months. According to estimates:\\n\\n- Influenza affects approximately 5-15% of the global population annually.\\n- Roughly 3-5 million severe cases are reported each year, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths associated with respiratory diseases caused by the virus.\\n\\nThe 2023-2024 Influenza season estimates indicated that approximately 40 million people were sick, with 28,000 deaths attributed to influenza.\\n\\n## History\\nHistorically, influenza has caused significant pandemics, including:\\n\\n- The Spanish Flu of 1918-1919, which resulted in millions of deaths and altered public health responses worldwide.\\n- The H1N1 pandemic of 2009, leading to renewed focus on vaccination strategies and antiviral treatments.\\n\\nImprovements in vaccination strategies and treatment protocols continue to evolve as we gain more understanding of this viral infection.\\n\\n## Sources for Further Information\\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n- [Wikipedia on Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)\\n\\nThis report encapsulates a comprehensive view of influenza, providing essential insights into its nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context, supported by reputable sources.\\n```\", \"tools\": []}", "used_tools": "\"0\"", "tools_errors": "\"0\"", "delegations": "\"0\"", "i18n": "\"prompt_file=None\"", "name": "\"writing_task\"", "description": "\"Using the information received, write a report, translating very technical terms into more common language.

The disease is characterized by symptoms that typically manifest suddenly and may lead to severe complications if not treated appropriately. Understanding the nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context of influenza is crucial to mitigating its impact on health.\\n\\n## Types of Influenza Viruses\\nInfluenza viruses are classified into four main types:\\n\\n1. **Influenza A**: This is the most common type of influenza virus and is known to cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics. It can infect various animals, such as birds and pigs, as well as humans. Influenza A is responsible for the most severe illnesses and is often associated with the seasonal flu outbreaks.\\n\\n2. **Influenza B**: Primarily found in humans, influenza B typically causes seasonal outbreaks but does not lead to pandemics. Vaccines for influenza B are included in the annual flu vaccine formulations.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: This type usually leads to mild respiratory infections and occurs less frequently than types A and B. It is not associated with large outbreaks or severe illness.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: Primarily affecting cattle, influenza D does not typically infect humans and thus poses no direct public health threat.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nInfluenza is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can also survive on surfaces, and individuals may become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their face. Understanding these modes of transmission is key to implementing effective preventive measures.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms typically develop one to four days post-exposure and can last from two to eight days. Common symptoms include:\\n\\n- **Fever**\\n- **Cough**\\n- **Sore throat**\\n- **Muscle aches**\\n- **Headache**\\n- **Fatigue**\\n- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Such as diarrhea and vomiting, particularly in children.\\n\\nThe rapid onset of symptoms can be severe, leading to complications if not addressed promptly.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nThe most effective method for preventing influenza is through annual vaccinations. Recommendations include:\\n\\n- **Flu Vaccines**: Recommended for everyone aged six months and older, these vaccines protect against multiple strains of influenza A and B.\\n- **Hygiene Practices**: Frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with infected individuals, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and disinfecting surfaces are effective preventive measures.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreatment for influenza generally includes:\\n\\n- **Supportive Care**: For uncomplicated cases, rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications can alleviate symptoms.\\n- **Antiviral Medications**: Such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be prescribed, particularly for severe cases or in high-risk populations.\\n\\n## Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to serious complications, particularly among high-risk groups, including:\\n\\n- **Pneumonia**\\n- **Bronchitis**\\n- **Sinus and ear infections**\\n- **Exacerbation of chronic medical conditions**.\\n\\nYoung children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health issues are particularly vulnerable to the severe impacts of influenza.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nThe influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics, particularly in temperate climates, peaking during winter months. According to estimates:\\n\\n- Influenza affects approximately 5-15% of the global population annually.\\n- Roughly 3-5 million severe cases are reported each year, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths associated with respiratory diseases caused by the virus.\\n\\nThe 2023-2024 Influenza season estimates indicated that approximately 40 million people were sick, with 28,000 deaths attributed to influenza.\\n\\n## History\\nHistorically, influenza has caused significant pandemics, including:\\n\\n- The Spanish Flu of 1918-1919, which resulted in millions of deaths and altered public health responses worldwide.\\n- The H1N1 pandemic of 2009, leading to renewed focus on vaccination strategies and antiviral treatments.\\n\\nImprovements in vaccination strategies and treatment protocols continue to evolve as we gain more understanding of this viral infection.\\n\\n## Sources for Further Information\\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n- [Wikipedia on Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)\\n\\nThis report encapsulates a comprehensive view of influenza, providing essential insights into its nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context, supported by reputable sources.\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

Vaccines targeting influenza B are included in the annual flu vaccination.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: This type causes mild respiratory infections and is less frequent than types A and B. It does not typically lead to significant outbreaks or severe health issues.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: Mainly affects cattle and does not pose a direct threat to human health, as it rarely infects people.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can survive on surfaces, making it possible for individuals to become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their faces. Understanding these transmission methods is crucial for effective prevention.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms generally appear between one to four days after exposure and can last anywhere from two to eight days. Common symptoms include:\\n\\n- **Fever**: A high temperature is often present.\\n- **Cough**: Frequent and persistent.\\n- **Sore throat**: Discomfort while swallowing.\\n- **Muscle aches**: General body pain and discomfort.\\n- **Headache**: Pain in the head region.\\n- **Fatigue**: A deep sense of tiredness.\\n- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Such as diarrhea and vomiting, particularly more common in children.\\n\\nSymptoms can be intense and may lead to further health issues if not managed appropriately.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nThe most effective ways to prevent influenza include:\\n\\n- **Annual flu vaccines**: Recommended for everyone aged six months and older, these vaccines protect against multiple strains of influenza A and B.\\n- **Good hygiene practices**: Regular handwashing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and cleaning commonly touched surfaces can help prevent infection.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nWhen it comes to treating influenza, standard approaches include:\\n\\n- **Supportive care**: For mild cases, rest, staying hydrated, and over-the-counter medications can help manage symptoms.\\n- **Antiviral medications**: Drugs like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be used, especially for severe cases or for individuals at high risk of complications.\\n\\n## Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations including:\\n\\n- **Pneumonia**: Life-threatening lung infection.\\n- **Bronchitis**: Inflammation of the airways.\\n- **Sinus and ear infections**: Secondary infections that may develop.\\n- **Worsening of chronic conditions**: Such as asthma or heart disease.\\n\\nYoung children, older adults, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing health issues are especially at risk for severe influenza impact.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nInfluenza causes seasonal epidemics, especially in temperate regions, with peaks during winter months. Estimates indicate that:\\n\\n- Influenza affects around 5-15% of the global population annually.\\n- About 3-5 million cases are deemed severe, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths related to respiratory diseases from influenza each year.\\n\\nFor the 2023-2024 influenza season, it was estimated that around 40 million people fell ill, with approximately 28,000 influenza-related deaths.\\n\\n## History\\nInfluenza has a history of causing notable pandemics, such as:\\n\\n- **The Spanish Flu (1918-1919)**: Resulting in millions of deaths and changing global health responses.\\n- **The 2009 H1N1 pandemic**: A renewed focus on effective vaccination and treatment strategies was prompted by this outbreak.\\n\\nOngoing improvements in vaccination approaches and treatment policies continue to evolve with new insights gained about this viral infection.\\n\\n## Sources for Further Information\\nFor more detailed information, the following resources are recommended:\\n\\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n- [Wikipedia on Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)\\n\\nThis report offers a thorough overview of influenza, encompassing critical insights into its nature, how it spreads, preventive measures, treatment options, and important historical context, bolstered by reputable sources.\"}}", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "null"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Crew.kickoff_3", "context": {"span_id": "0x30b7393f60a914f6", "trace_id": "0xa7c6aa73de334f6444959be0753e6633"}, "parent_id": "0x0816024a213546b6", "start_time": 1742646656194413933, "end_time": 1742646752157465452, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"896af6ca7ee342eeab388b3e10b9873c\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"CHAIN\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"inputs\": {\"topic\": \"Lyme Disease\"}}", "cache": "true", "tasks": "\"[{'agent': '{topic} Senior Data Researcher\\\\n', 'description': 'Conduct a thorough research about {topic} Make sure you find any relevant information of renowned sources.\\\\n', 'async_execution': False, 'expected_output': 'A set of relevant information about {topic}\\\\n', 'human_input': False, 'tools': [SerperDevTool(name='Search the internet with Serper', description=\\\"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

This disease is transmitted through bites from infected black-legged ticks, commonly called deer ticks. Lyme disease is found in various areas, particularly in the northeastern United States, parts of the Midwest, and multiple regions in Europe and Asia.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can appear in several stages, with each stage showing different health challenges:\\n\\n### Early Localized Stage (1-4 weeks post-bite)\\n- **Erythema migrans (EM)**: A \\\"bull's-eye\\\" rash usually develops within 3-30 days after a tick bite. This rash can feel warm but is generally not itchy or painful.\\n- **Flu-like symptoms**: These may include fever, chills, fatigue, headaches, and muscle or joint pains.\\n\\n### Early Disseminated Stage (weeks to months post-bite)\\nIf untreated, the *Borrelia* bacteria can spread through the bloodstream:\\n- Multiple rashes can appear on various parts of the body.\\n- Symptoms of neuroborreliosis: Weakness in facial muscles (facial palsy), neck stiffness, and possibly severe heart rhythm issues (known as Lyme carditis).\\n\\n### Late Stage (months to years post-bite)\\n- **Lyme arthritis**: This can cause recurring pain and swelling in large joints, particularly in the knees.\\n- Neurological problems may arise, which can include cognitive difficulties, often described as \\\"brain fog,\\\" and other persistent chronic symptoms even after treatment.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease usually involves assessing symptoms and history of tick exposure, particularly checking for the characteristic rash. In some cases, blood tests may be utilized to confirm the presence of antibodies against *Borrelia*.\\n\\n### Testing Protocol\\n1. **ELISA Test**: The initial screening test known for its sensitivity.\\n2. **Western Blot Test**: A more specific follow-up test if the ELISA is positive.\\n\\n### Challenges\\nEarly testing might yield false negatives as the body may not have produced enough antibodies yet.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe main treatment for Lyme disease is antibiotics. The specific antibiotic used and the duration of treatment can differ based on the disease's stage:\\n- **For early localized disease**: Common antibiotics include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime.\\n- **For advanced stages**: Intravenous ceftriaxone may be necessary, especially for cases affecting the heart or nervous system.\\n\\n### Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)\\nSome patients may continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue and muscle pain despite completing antibiotic treatment, a condition known as PTLDS.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventing Lyme disease primarily revolves around avoiding tick bites, which can be managed by:\\n- Applying insect repellent containing DEET or permethrin onto clothing.\\n- Wearing protective clothing like long sleeves and pants in wooded or grassy areas.\\n- Conducting tick checks after being outdoors.\\n- Removing any ticks promptly with fine-tipped tweezers.\\n\\n### Environmental Control\\nManaging your surroundings can significantly reduce tick populations and their habitats to lower exposure risk.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease can be effectively treated, especially with early diagnosis. Understanding the symptoms, taking appropriate preventive steps, and seeking timely medical care are crucial in managing the disease and minimizing long-lasting complications.

Ongoing research remains essential to improve our understanding, treatment options, and possible vaccination development.\\n\\n## References\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html)\\n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease)\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11586-lyme-disease)\\n- [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/lymedisease.html)\\n- [Penn Medicine](https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/lyme-disease)\\n- [AVMA on Lyme Disease in Dogs](https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/lyme-disease-dogs)\\n\\nThis report captures essential insights and recommendations regarding Lyme disease, encompassing its understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Lyme Disease Senior Summarizer\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}], \"token_usage\": {\"total_tokens\": 222941, \"prompt_tokens\": 219571, \"cached_prompt_tokens\": 148736, \"completion_tokens\": 3370, \"successful_requests\": 11}}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Task.execute_sync_7", "context": {"span_id": "0xf51ce09536bbdb44", "trace_id": "0xa7c6aa73de334f6444959be0753e6633"}, "parent_id": "0x30b7393f60a914f6", "start_time": 1742646656202439218, "end_time": 1742646676395751808, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"896af6ca7ee342eeab388b3e10b9873c\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"CHAIN\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"\", \"tools\": [{\"name\": \"Search the internet with Serper\", \"description\": \"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

Lyme disease is prevalent in various geographical areas, including the northeastern United States, parts of the Midwest, and various regions in Europe and Asia.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nSymptoms of Lyme disease can manifest in stages, with each stage presenting different issues:\\n\\n### Early Localized Stage (1-4 weeks post-bite)\\n- **Erythema migrans (EM)**: A distinctive \\\"bull's-eye\\\" rash that typically appears within 3-30 days after a tick bite. The rash may feel warm but is rarely itchy or painful.\\n- **Flu-like symptoms**: Fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint aches.\\n\\n### Early Disseminated Stage (weeks to months post-bite)\\nIf the disease is not treated, *Borrelia* can spread through the blood:\\n- Multiple rashes appearing on different body parts.\\n- Neuroborreliosis symptoms: Facial palsy (weakness in facial muscles), neck stiffness, and potentially serious irregular heart rhythms (Lyme carditis).\\n\\n### Late Stage (months to years post-bite)\\n- **Lyme arthritis**: Recurring pain and swelling in large joints, especially the knees.\\n- Possible neurological issues, including cognitive difficulties (often referred to as \\\"brain fog\\\") and other chronic symptoms that can persist post-treatment.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis is typically based on clinical findings, specifically a history of tick exposure and the identification of symptoms, especially the characteristic rash. In some cases, serological testing may also be used to confirm the presence of antibodies against *Borrelia* spp. \\n\\n### Testing Protocol\\n1. **ELISA**: The initial test with high sensitivity.\\n2. **Western Blot**: A more specific secondary test if the ELISA result is positive.\\n\\n### Challenges\\nEarly testing may yield false negatives due to insufficient antibody production. \\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe primary treatment for Lyme disease is antibiotics. The specific choice of antibiotic and duration may vary based on disease stage:\\n- **For early localized disease**: Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime.\\n- **For advanced stages**: Intravenous ceftriaxone is often the treatment of choice for cases involving the heart or nervous system.\\n\\n### Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)\\nSome individuals may experience lingering symptoms, including fatigue and muscle pain, even after completing antibiotic treatment. This condition is termed PTLDS.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventing Lyme disease primarily involves avoiding tick bites by:\\n- Using insect repellents containing DEET or permethrin on clothing.\\n- Wearing protective clothing (long sleeves and pants).\\n- Performing tick checks after outdoor activities, especially in wooded or grassy areas.\\n- Promptly removing ticks with fine-tipped tweezers.\\n\\n### Environmental Control\\nReducing exposure by managing landscape environments can greatly diminish tick habitats.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease can be treated effectively, especially if diagnosed early. Awareness of symptoms, appropriate preventive measures, and timely medical intervention are critical in controlling the spread of the disease and reducing the risk of long-term complications. Continuing research into the disease is essential for improving understanding, treatment protocols, and potential vaccination strategies.\\n\\n## References\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html)\\n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease)\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/)\\n- [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/lymedisease.html)\\n\\nThis report synthesizes the key insights and recommendations for understanding, diagnosing, treating, and preventing Lyme Disease.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Lyme Disease Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_8", "context": {"span_id": "0x4b7532fce919a2bf", "trace_id": "0xa7c6aa73de334f6444959be0753e6633"}, "parent_id": "0xb605ee0850049a90", "start_time": 1742646676406583443, "end_time": 1742646736374468445, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"896af6ca7ee342eeab388b3e10b9873c\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"1. **Mayo Clinic**\\n   - [Mayo Clinic Overview on Lyme Disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651)\\n   - Key points include:\\n     - Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia bacteria.\\n     - Symptoms can range from fever and rash to joint and neurological issues.\\n\\n2. **CDC**\\n   - [CDC's Lyme Disease Resource](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html)\\n   - Highlights:\\n     - Spread by infected ticks.\\n     - Symptoms include rash, fatigue, and in later stages, joint and neurological issues.\\n\\n3. **Wikipedia**\\n   - [Wikipedia on Lyme Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease)\\n   - General overview of Lyme disease, its causative agents, and propagation through tick bites.\\n\\n4. **Cleveland Clinic**\\n   - [Cleveland Clinic Overview](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11586-lyme-disease)\\n   - Discussion of Lyme disease symptoms and treatment options.\\n\\n5. **MedlinePlus**\\n   - [MedlinePlus Information](https://medlineplus.gov/lymedisease.html)\\n   - Comprehensive facts about Lyme disease and its effects.\\n\\n6. **Penn Medicine**\\n   - [Penn Medicine Resource](https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/lyme-disease)\\n   - In-depth look into symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment protocols.\\n\\n7. **AVMA on Lyme Disease in Dogs**\\n   - [AVMA on Lyme Disease in Dogs](https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/lyme-disease-dogs)\\n   - Insight into how Lyme disease affects canine health and care.\\n```\", \"tools\": [{\"name\": \"Search the internet with Serper\", \"description\": \"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash , known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. [ 1 ] The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. [ 1 ] Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. [ 1 ] Early diagnosis can be difficult. [ 11 ] Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness . [ 1 ] If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face , joint pains , severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations . [ 1 ] Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. [ 1 ] Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. [ 1 ]\\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes . [ 12 ] In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , \\\"In most cases, a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.\\\" [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In North America, the bacterial species Borrelia burgdorferi and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease. [ 4 ] [ 16 ] In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii , Borrelia garinii , B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. [ 4 ] The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals nor through food. [ 13 ] Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. [ 5 ] [ 17 ] Blood tests are often falsely negative in the early stages of the disease. [ 4 ] Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. [ 18 ]\\nPrevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin -based insect repellents . [ 4 ] [ 9 ] Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. [ 4 ] Ticks can be removed using tweezers . [ 19 ] If the removed tick is full of blood a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent the development of infection but is not generally recommended since the development of infection is rare. [ 4 ] If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime . [ 4 ] Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. [ 4 ] Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment, which may last for one or two days. [ 4 ] In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. [ 4 ] [ 20 ]\\nLyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. [ 21 ] [ 8 ] Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. [ 4 ] Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . [ 22 ] The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer . [ 23 ] People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). [ 24 ] PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease , a term no longer supported by scientists and used in different ways by different groups. [ 20 ] [ 25 ] Some healthcare providers claim that chronic Lyme is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment. [ 26 ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] , clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced, but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. [ 27 ] There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nSigns and symptoms [ edit ]\\nLyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms.\\n20% of Lyme rashes in the United States show a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" appearance. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]\\nErythema migrans (\\\"migrating redness\\\") on a woman's neck. [ 31 ] Rashes from non-Lyme causes may look similar. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]\\nThe incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). [ 34 ] Lyme symptoms most often occur from the month of May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases. [ 34 ]\\nEarly localized infection [ edit ]\\n80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit , groin , back of the knee , or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (median is 16 cm). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] [ 32 ]\\nThe rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. [ 4 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM) which translates as \\\"migrating redness.\\\" In about 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges possibly forming a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" pattern, but this clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. [ 32 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. [ 4 ]\\nThe Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms. [ 4 ]\\nPeople with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis . [ 35 ]\\nNot everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms, and many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases. [ 36 ]\\nAsymptomatic infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States. [ 37 ] Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe. [ 38 ]\\nEarly disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nWithin days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the Borrelia bacteria may spread through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10–20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. [ 28 ] Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common. [ 28 ]\\nIn about 10–15% of untreated people, Lyme causes neurological problems known as neuroborreliosis . [ 39 ] Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4–6 weeks (range 1–12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy, and/or mononeuritis multiplex. [ 35 ] [ 40 ] Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. [ 41 ] After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms . Up to 76.5% of them present as tinnitus , the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness (53.7%) and hearing loss (16.7%) were the next most common symptoms. [ 42 ] In children, partial loss of vision may also occur. [ 35 ] Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves . When due to Lyme, it most typically causes facial palsy , impairing blinking, smiling, and chewing on one or both sides of the face. It may also cause intermittent double vision . [ 35 ] [ 41 ] Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness , numbness , or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots , e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. [ 39 ] [ 35 ] Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord , with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech , impaired movement , impaired motor planning , or shaking . [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn North America, facial palsy is the typical early neuroborreliosis presentation, occurring in 5–10% of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. [ 35 ] [ 44 ] Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. [ 45 ] In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome , accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ] In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. [ 38 ] In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%). [ 40 ]\\nIn about 4–10% of untreated cases in the United States and 0.3–4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days to 7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness , fainting , shortness of breath , and chest pain . [ 46 ] Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches , facial palsy , headaches , or radicular pain . [ 46 ] In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis in 19–87% of people adversely impacts the heart's electrical conduction system, causing atrioventricular block that often manifests as heart rhythms that alternate within minutes between abnormally slow and abnormally fast. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 10–15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly , left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure. [ 46 ]\\nAnother skin condition, found in Europe but not in North America, is borrelial lymphocytoma , a purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum . [ 48 ]\\nLate disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nLyme arthritis caused this 3-year-old girl's knee to become swollen. Though painless, it did make her limp. [ 49 ]\\nLyme arthritis occurs in up to 60% of untreated people, typically starting about six months after infection. [ 28 ] It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip , other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint . [ 35 ] [ 50 ] Usually, large joint effusion and swelling occur, but only mild or moderate pain. [ 35 ] Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time, but periodically return. [ 35 ] Baker's cysts may form and rupture.\\n In early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and over time possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis that discovered poor documentation of this manifestation, experts wondered if it exists at all in the US or is merely very rare. [ 35 ] [ 51 ]\\nA neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia , a general sense of feeling unwell , and changes in personality. [ 52 ] Lyme encephalopathy is controversial in the US and has not been reported in Europe. [ 8 ] Problems such as depression and fibromyalgia are as common in people with Lyme disease as in the general population. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] There is no compelling evidence that Lyme disease causes psychiatric disorders, behavioral disorders (e.g. ADHD ), or developmental disorders (e.g. autism ). [ 55 ]\\nAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly. [ 48 ] It begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. [ 56 ] It is also associated with peripheral neuropathy. [ 51 ]\\nCause [ edit ]\\nMain article: Lyme disease microbiology\\nFurther information: Weather and climate effects on Lyme disease exposure\\nBorrelia bacteria, the causative agents of Lyme disease, magnified\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochetes , gram-negative bacteria from the genus Borrelia . Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella . [ 57 ] The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato , and show a great deal of genetic diversity . [ 58 ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato is a species complex made up of 20 accepted and three proposed genospecies. Eight species are known to cause Lyme disease: B. mayonii (found in North America), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (found in North America and Europe), B. afzelii , B. garinii, B. spielmanii, and B. lusitaniae (all found in Eurasia ). [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 16 ] [ 10 ] Some studies have also proposed that B. valaisiana may sometimes infect humans, but this species does not seem to be an important cause of disease. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]\\nTick life cycle [ edit ]\\nDeer tick life cycle\\nIxodes scapularis , the primary vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America\\nThree stages occur in the life cycle of a tick - larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and are usually most active in late spring and early summer in regions where the climate is mild. During the adult stage, Lyme disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and tend to be larger in size, so can be easily seen and removed. [ 63 ]\\nTransmission [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is classified as a zoonosis , as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts . [ 64 ] Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia ). [ 65 ] Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage , because they are very small, thus may feed for long periods of time undetected. [ 64 ] Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. [ 66 ] Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. [ 67 ] The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected. [ 68 ] Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Borrelia from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse , and occasionally birds. [ 69 ] Areas where Lyme is common are expanding. [ 70 ]\\nWithin the tick midgut, the Borrelia ' s outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the Borrelia downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection. [ 71 ] Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC. [ 72 ]\\nTick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. [ 73 ]\\nWhile B. burgdorferi is most associated with ticks hosted by white-tailed deer and white-footed mice , Borrelia afzelii is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto . The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association. [ 74 ]\\nBudding research has suggested that B. burgdorferi sensu lato may also be able to form enzootic cycle among lizard populations; [ 75 ] this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations of lizards, such as California. Except for one study in Europe, [ 74 ] much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia , it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific. [ 79 ]\\nTick Ixodes ricinus , developmental stages\\nIn Europe, the main vector is Ixodes ricinus , which is also called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. [ 80 ] In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector. [ 81 ] In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) is the main vector on the East Coast. [ 68 ]\\nThe lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as Texas , is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes , [ 82 ] though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness , which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease. [ 83 ]\\nOn the West Coast of the United States , the main vector is the western black-legged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ). [ 84 ] The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the western fence lizard that are resistant to Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West. [ 85 ] [ 79 ]\\nTransmission can occur across the placenta during pregnancy and as with a number of other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\\nThere is no scientific evidence to support Lyme disease transmission via blood transfusion, sexual contact, or breast milk. [ 90 ]\\nTick-borne co-infections [ edit ]\\nMain article: Tick-borne disease\\nTicks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other microbes, such as Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. [ 91 ] Among people with early Lyme disease, depending on their location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–10% will have babesiosis. [ 55 ] Ticks in certain regions also transmit viruses that cause tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan virus disease . [ 92 ] [ 55 ] Co-infections of Lyme disease may not require additional treatment, since they may resolve on their own or—as in the case of HGA—can be treated with the doxycycline prescribed for Lyme. [ 35 ] Persistent fever or compatible anomalous laboratory findings may be indicative of a co-infection. [ 55 ]\\nPathophysiology [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. [ 72 ] [ 93 ] B. Burgdorferi does not produce toxins. [ 94 ] Therefore, many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to spirochete in those tissues. [ 95 ]\\nB. burgdorferi is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. [ 96 ] Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. [ 97 ] This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis . The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. [ 72 ] Neutrophils , however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body. [ 98 ]\\nDays to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete. [ 99 ]\\nIf untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. [ 100 ] The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement , and hiding in the extracellular matrix , which may interfere with the function of immune factors. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]\\nImmunological studies [ edit ]\\nExposure to the Borrelia bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging inflammatory response , [ 103 ] a form of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease. [ 104 ] The production of this reaction might be due to a form of molecular mimicry , where Borrelia avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]\\nChronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever , but its wider application is controversial. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash, facial palsy , or arthritis ), history of possible exposure to infected ticks , and possibly laboratory tests . [ 4 ] [ 28 ] People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1–2 months. [ 35 ] Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common , within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull's eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms. [ 4 ] [ 111 ] In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota , but it is expanding into other areas. [ 70 ] Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk. [ 112 ]\\nIn the absence of an EM rash or history of tick exposure, Lyme diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation. [ 65 ] [ 113 ] The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time-consuming to grow in the laboratory. [ 4 ] [ 65 ] The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. [ 114 ] A positive antibody test result does not by itself prove active infection but can confirm an infection that is suspected because of symptoms, objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. [ 65 ] Because as many as 5–20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be tested for Lyme antibodies: a positive result would likely be false, possibly causing unnecessary treatment. [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available. [ 44 ] [ 115 ]\\nLaboratory testing [ edit ]\\nTests for antibodies in the blood by ELISA and Western blot is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. [ 116 ] The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2–4 weeks and 4–6 weeks, and peak at 6–8 weeks. [ 117 ] When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. [ 35 ] Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. [ 117 ] A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false-positive result. [ 118 ] The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4–6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years. [ 117 ]\\nOther tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii and almost always involves lymphocytic pleocytosis , i.e. the densities of lymphocytes (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Demonstration by lumbar puncture and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans , which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). [ 40 ] In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative. [ 119 ] American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat. [ 43 ] In infection involving the PNS, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment. [ 41 ]\\nIn Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography may show myocardial dysfunction. [ 46 ] Biopsy and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure. [ 46 ]\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material ( DNA ) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia . PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. [ 121 ] [ 40 ] Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during infection. [ 122 ] [ 40 ] Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid. [ 123 ] Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people. [ 40 ]\\nSeveral other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. OspA antigens , shed by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. [ 124 ] The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years. [ 127 ]\\nThe CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of B. burgdorferi , and lymphocyte transformation tests. [ 122 ]\\nImaging [ edit ]\\nNeuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis , but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. [ 128 ] Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vasculitis and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease , which makes them questionable. [ 129 ]\\nDifferential diagnosis [ edit ]\\nCommunity clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23–28% of erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. [ 113 ] EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites , cellulitis , or shingles . [ 113 ] Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull's eye. [ 4 ] Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2–3 cm/day and a diameter of at least 5 cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. [ 28 ] [ 32 ] Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee. [ 28 ] Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve's dermatome , and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. [ 130 ]\\nFacial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy . [ 44 ] Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. [ 44 ] Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. [ 44 ] Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. [ 44 ] Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. [ 44 ]\\nUnlike viral meningitis , Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy , or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF . [ 35 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the limbs is often misdiagnosed as a radiculopathy caused by nerve root compression, such as sciatica . [ 113 ] [ 131 ] Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4–6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating risks of other possible causes that, although less frequent, require immediate diagnosis and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. [ 132 ] A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms of lymphocytic meningitis, or facial palsy would lead to suspicion of Lyme disease and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation. [ 132 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and acute coronary syndrome . [ 45 ] [ 113 ] Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new \\\"great imitator\\\". [ 133 ] As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms. [ 134 ]\\nPrevention [ edit ]\\nTick bites may be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. [ 135 ] [ 9 ]\\nMost Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. [ 28 ] [ 135 ] Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands , shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. [ 28 ] [ 136 ] Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\\\"quest\\\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. [ 138 ] In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. [ 137 ] Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. [ 137 ] [ 135 ] In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. [ 137 ] Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. [ 137 ] [ 139 ] Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. [ 136 ]\\nAs a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. [ 135 ] [ 140 ] Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. [ 141 ] After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). [ 141 ] Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. [ 139 ] Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. [ 139 ] Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. [ 142 ] Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. [ 140 ] Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. [ 140 ] [ 143 ]\\nThe EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET , picaridin , IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD) . [ 135 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. [ 140 ] The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. [ 145 ] Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. [ 145 ] Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. [ 140 ] [ 144 ] Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). [ 140 ] [ 135 ] If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. [ 140 ] Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. [ 140 ]\\nAfter coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. [ 135 ] Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or warm dryer are not enough). [ 135 ] Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduce risk of infection. [ 135 ] Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister . [ 146 ] The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair. [ 135 ]\\nTick removal [ edit ]\\nRemoval of a tick using tweezers\\nAttached ticks should be removed promptly. Risk of infection increases with time of attachment, but in North America risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. [ 147 ] CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from the skin without twisting, jerking, squeezing or crushing the tick. [ 148 ] After tick removal, any tick parts remaining in the skin should be removed with a clean tweezer, if possible. [ 148 ] The wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. [ 148 ] The tick may be disposed by placing it in a container with alcohol, sealed bag, tape or flushed down the toilet. [ 148 ] The bitten person should write down where and when the bite happened so that this can be informed to a doctor if the person gets a rash or flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. [ 148 ] CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it. [ 148 ]\\nIn Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. [ 149 ] Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. [ 149 ] Another method consists in using about 20 cm of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]\\nPreventive antibiotics [ edit ]\\nThe risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. [ 28 ] It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. [ 28 ] If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70–80% of people infected). [ 4 ] [ 28 ]\\nGarden landscaping [ edit ]\\nSeveral landscaping practices may reduce the risk of tick bites in residential yards. [ 146 ] [ 152 ] These include keeping lawns mown, removing leaf litter and weeds and avoiding the use of ground cover. [ 146 ] A 3-ft-wide rock or woodchip barrier is recommended to separate lawns from wood piles, woodlands , stone walls and shrubs. [ 152 ] Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it to kill ticks. [ 152 ] A sun-exposed tick-safe zone at least 9 ft from the barrier should concentrate human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. [ 152 ] Materials such as wood decking, concrete, bricks, gravel or woodchips used on the ground under patios and playgrounds would discourage ticks there. [ 146 ] An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone. [ 152 ] [ 146 ]\\nOccupational exposure [ edit ]\\nOutdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active. [ 155 ]\\nHost animals [ edit ]\\nTicks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards , birds , mice , cats , dogs , deer , cattle and humans . The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \\\"dilution hosts\\\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and so decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. White-tailed deer are both a food source and a \\\"reproductive host\\\", where ticks tend to mate. [ 156 ] The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. Availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted. [ 157 ]\\nIn the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine , [ 158 ] and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. [ 159 ] Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. [ 160 ] While these studies have found these effects, other studies have found opposite effects. A study done in Massachusetts removed deer and did not see a significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. [ 161 ] Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to effectively control tick populations. [ 162 ] One study summarized the results of multiple studies all looking at deer reduction controlling tick populations and determined that deer control can't be used as a standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that since most of the studies looking at this are not good representatives of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. [ 163 ] There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen, would decrease Lyme disease risk the most. [ 164 ]\\nOthers have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not Borrelia burgdorferi reservoirs. This is because it was found that white-tailed deer blood actually kills the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. [ 165 ] Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks , may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission. [ 157 ]\\nTick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. [ 166 ] They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals through the use of acaricides has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on a number of grounds. Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment. [ 167 ]\\nIn Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). [ 168 ] These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. [ 168 ] \\\"The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus ; [ 169 ] \\\" it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi \\\" thought Jaenson & al. (1992) [ 170 ] (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, [ 171 ] as red deer and wild boars ( Sus scrofa ), [ 169 ] in which one Rickettsia and three Borrelia species were identified\\\", [ 169 ] with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. [ 172 ] Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe \\\" two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified \\\". [ 169 ]\\nVaccination [ edit ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] no human vaccines for Lyme disease were available. [ 27 ] The only human vaccine to advance to market was LYMErix, which was available from 1998, but discontinued in 2002. [ 173 ] The vaccine candidate VLA15 was scheduled to start a phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2022, with other research ongoing. Multiple vaccines are available for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nLYMErix [ edit ]\\nThe vaccine LYMErix was available from 1998 to 2002. The recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, was developed by SmithKline Beecham . In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine was found to confer protective immunity to Lyme disease in 76% of adults after three doses with only mild or moderate and transient adverse effects . [ 174 ] [ 175 ] On 21 December 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix on the basis of these trials for persons of ages 15 through 70. [ 175 ] [ 173 ]\\nFollowing approval of the vaccine , its entry into clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. [ 176 ] Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline , alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints. [ 177 ]\\nDespite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, [ 178 ] in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. [ 177 ] [ 179 ] The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a \\\"cautionary tale\\\"; [ 179 ] an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which \\\"unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.\\\" [ 180 ] The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told Nature : \\\"This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.\\\" [ 177 ] [ 181 ]\\nVLA15 [ edit ]\\nThe hexavalent (OspA) protein subunit-based vaccine candidate VLA15 was developed by Valneva . It was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017. [ 182 ] [ 183 ] In April 2020 Pfizer paid $130 million for the rights to the vaccine, and the companies are developing it together, performing multiple phase 2 trials. [ 184 ]\\nA phase 3 trial of VLA15 was scheduled for late 2022, recruiting volunteers at test sites located across the northeastern United States and in Europe. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Participants were scheduled to receive an initial three-dose series of vaccines over the course of five to nine months, followed by a booster dose after twelve months, with both the initial series and the booster dose scheduled to be complete before the year's peak Lyme disease season. [ 186 ]\\nOther research [ edit ]\\nAn mRNA vaccine designed to cause a strong fast immune response to tick saliva allowed the immune system to detect and remove the ticks from test animals before they were able to transmit the infectious bacteria. [ 187 ] The vaccine contains mRNAs for the body to build 19 proteins in tick saliva which, by enabling quick development of erythema (itchy redness) at the bite site, protects guinea pigs against Lyme disease. It also protected the test animals if the tick is not removed if only one tick, but not three, remain attached. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\\nCanine vaccines [ edit ]\\nCanine vaccines have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet- Schering-Plough 's vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA . The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial , generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog. [ 190 ]\\nTreatment [ edit ]\\nAntibiotics are the primary treatment. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. [ 28 ] For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. [ 28 ] People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns . [ 35 ] Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; [ 28 ] alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , and azithromycin . [ 28 ] Azithromycin is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. [ 35 ] The standard treatment for cellulitis , cephalexin , is not useful for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , as these are effective against both infections. [ 35 ] Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy , radiculopathy , meningitis , or peripheral neuropathy . [ 28 ] Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; [ 28 ] cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives. [ 28 ]\\nTreatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7–14 days in early localized disease, to 14–21 days in early disseminated disease to 14–28 days in late disseminated disease. [ 55 ] Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. [ 120 ] In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone . [ 120 ] Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. [ 28 ] [ 35 ] Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no evidence shows it to be effective. [ 28 ] [ 191 ] IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. [ 28 ] As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. [ 28 ]\\nFacial palsy may resolve without treatment: however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. [ 35 ] Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. [ 44 ] In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. [ 44 ] [ 192 ]\\nAbout a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids. [ 46 ]\\nPeople with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping should use crutches. [ 193 ] Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [ 35 ] Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. [ 35 ] [ 193 ] People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for Borrelia DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. [ 35 ] [ 55 ] [ 193 ] Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy , or physical therapy. [ 55 ] [ 193 ]\\nPeople receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it . [ 115 ]\\nPrognosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease's typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. [ 4 ] However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues. [ 35 ]\\nPeople who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. [ 113 ] Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64–71% at end of treatment for EM rash to about 84–90% after 30 months; higher percentages are reported in Europe. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Treatment failure, i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. [ 194 ] Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g. joint or muscle pains or fatigue . [ 196 ] These symptoms are usually mild and nondisabling. [ 196 ]\\nPeople treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits, in addition to subjective symptoms. [ 35 ] In Europe, an average of 32–33 months after initial Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14–21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with only an EM rash (16%). [ 197 ] In another European study, 5 years after treatment for neuroborreliosis lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter were less common among those treated within 30 days of the first symptom (16%) than among those treated later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated. [ 198 ]\\nSome data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] However, in Europe 41% of people treated for facial palsy had other lingering symptoms at followup up to 6 months later, including 28% with numbness or altered sensation and 14% with fatigue or concentration problems. [ 200 ] Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. [ 199 ] [ 201 ] Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another one is voluntarily moved) can become evident only 6–12 months after facial palsy appears to be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. [ 202 ] Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. [ 202 ] In longer-term follow-up, 16–23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover. [ 202 ]\\nIn Europe, about a quarter of people with Bannwarth syndrome (Lyme radiculopathy and lymphocytic meningitis ) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3–6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection in cerebrospinal fluid ; after 12 months, 64% recovered fully, 31% had nondisabling mild or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or required substantial use of analgesics. [ 43 ] The most common lingering nondisabling symptoms were headache, fatigue , altered sensation , joint pains , memory disturbances, malaise , radicular pain , sleep disturbances, muscle pains , and concentration disturbances. Lingering disabling symptoms included facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ]\\nRecovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage. [ 35 ]\\nAbout half the people with Lyme carditis progress to complete heart block , but it usually resolves in a week. [ 46 ] Other Lyme heart conduction abnormalities resolve typically within 6 weeks. [ 46 ] About 94% of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). [ 46 ] Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. [ 46 ] However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal. [ 46 ]\\nRecommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several months for inflammation to resolve and a second round of antibiotics is often necessary. [ 35 ] Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9–14 months (range 4 months – 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery. [ 193 ]\\nReinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6–11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. [ 194 ] The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain. [ 203 ]\\nPost-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [ edit ]\\nChronic symptoms like pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment are experienced by 5–20% of people who contract Lyme disease, even after completing treatment. This is called Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. [ 24 ] [ 204 ]\\nThe cause is unknown. One hypothesis is that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains. However, human and animal trials have not provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. [ 205 ] Another hypothesis is that autoimmunity has been triggered by the infection. Auto–immune responses are known to occur following other infections, including Campylobacter ( Guillain-Barré syndrome ), Chlamydia (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease). A third hypothesis is that debris from \\na previous infection could remain. [ 205 ]\\nAnother hypothesis is that symptoms are simply unrelated to a Lyme infection. [ 206 ] [ 207 ] In studies of people who presented to clinics with concerns about Lyme disease, 47 to 80% had no evidence of Lyme infection while 15 to 55% (median 34%) were able to obtain other diagnoses. [ 205 ]\\nThere is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective in early Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotics are not. They have been shown ineffective in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and is similar to the management of fibromyalgia or ME/CFS . PTLDS usually gets better over time, but recovery may take many months. [ 206 ]\\nEpidemiology and prevalence [ edit ]\\nCountries with reported Lyme disease cases\\nOverview [ edit ]\\nLyme disease occurs regularly in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. [ 208 ]\\nLyme disease effects are comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds.\\n An estimated 476,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated for the disease in the United States. This number is probably an overestimate due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated in Europe. [ 8 ] [ 4 ] [ 209 ]\\nThere is a suggestion that tick populations and Lyme disease occurrence are increasing and spreading into new areas, owing in part to the warming temperatures of climate change . [ 210 ] However, tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. [ 157 ] [ 211 ]\\nNorth America [ edit ]\\nMany studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of I. scapularis projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S. [ 212 ] A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. [ 213 ] The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology . [ 213 ]\\nUnited States [ edit ]\\nCDC map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the Northeast Megalopolis and western Wisconsin\\nLyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ]\\nAlthough Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). [ 90 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria has been modified multiple times. [ 219 ] The 2022 surveillance case definition classifies cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect. [ 220 ] The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.\\n The CDC emphasizes that, while surveillance data has limitations, it is useful due to \\\"uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness.\\\" While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted. [ 221 ] [ 90 ]\\nSeveral similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), also known as Masters disease. Amblyomma americanum , known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment. [ 222 ]\\nIn recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever. [ 218 ]\\nCanada [ edit ]\\nThe range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. [ 112 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] A model-based prediction by Leighton et al. (2012) suggests that the range of the I. scapularis tick will expand into Canada by 46 km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread. [ 226 ]\\nEurope [ edit ]\\nIn Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete B. burgdorferi sensu lato , mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus . [ 227 ] Cases of B. burgdorferi sensu lato -infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. [ 228 ] The number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. [ 229 ] Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising. [ 230 ] Lyme disease is rare in Iceland. On average around 6 to 7 cases are diagnosed every year, primarily localised infections presenting as erythema migrans. None of the cases had a definitive Icelandic origin and the yearly number of cases has not been increasing. [ 231 ]\\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\\nIn the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986 [ 232 ] when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Ireland combined. [ 233 ] In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, [ 234 ] but 973 in 2009 [ 232 ] and 953 in 2010. [ 235 ] Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010. [ 236 ]\\nIt is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year [ 235 ] (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas [ 232 ] ), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 \\\"to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor.\\\" [ 237 ] [ 238 ]\\nDespite Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi infection) being a notifiable disease in Scotland [ 239 ] since January 1990 [ 240 ] which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. [ 241 ] Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. [ 232 ]\\nAlthough there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest , Salisbury Plain , Exmoor , the South Downs , parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire , Thetford Forest [ 242 ] and the West coast and islands of Scotland, [ 243 ] infected ticks are widespread and can even be found in the parks of London. [ 234 ] [ 244 ] A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive , as were between 2% and 4–5% of the general local population of the area. [ 245 ] [ 246 ]\\nTests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] It is speculated that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. [ 249 ] However no published research has proven this to be so.\\nSouth America [ edit ]\\nIn Brazil, Lyme disease is not considered endemic. [ 250 ] A Lyme-like disease known as Baggio–Yoshinari syndrome has been described, attributed to microorganisms that do not belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted by ticks of the Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera. [ 251 ] The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia , São Paulo. [ 252 ] A 2024 analysis concluded that evidence to connect BYS to Borrelia bacteria was lacking. [ 250 ]\\nMexico [ edit ]\\nA 2007 study suggests Borrelia burgdorferi infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000. [ 253 ]\\nAfrica [ edit ]\\nIn northern Africa, B. burgdorferi sensu lato has been identified in Morocco , Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia . [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ]\\nLyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this region. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of Lyme infection in Africa. [ 257 ] In East Africa, two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya . [ 258 ] According The Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa, Lyme disease is not known to be endemic in either South Africa or Mozambique. [ 259 ]\\nAsia [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato -infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China, Nepal , Thailand and far eastern Russia. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Borrelia has also been isolated in Mongolia . [ 262 ]\\nAustraliasia [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is not considered endemic to Australia. [ 263 ] While there have been reports of people acquiring Lyme disease in Australia, and even evidence of closely related Borrelia species in ticks, [ 264 ] the evidence linking these cases to local transmission is limited. Ongoing research on resolving potential Borrelia species to Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT) in Australia are ongoing. [ 265 ]\\nEtymology [ edit ]\\nLyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . [ 266 ]\\nHistory [ edit ]\\nEarly evidence [ edit ]\\nThe earliest known evidence of Lyme disease was found in Oetzi , a 5300 year old mummy in the Eastern Alps near the Italian border. [ 267 ] \\nThe evolutionary history of Borrelia burgdorferi genetics has been examined by scientists. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the Midwest that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. [ 268 ]\\nJohn Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663 to 1670, wrote \\\"there be infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\\\" [ 269 ]\\nThis is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm , a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus , and who found the forests of New York \\\"abound\\\" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. [ 270 ]\\nPerhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. [ 271 ] He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \\\"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\\\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \\\"worm\\\" with a body which is \\\"of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\\\" that \\\"penetrates the skin\\\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. [ 272 ]\\nThe examination of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. [ 270 ] The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman , a 5,300-year-old mummy , revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. [ 273 ]\\nThe early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau , Germany (now Wrocław , Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who for 16 years had had a degenerative skin disorder now known as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans . [ 274 ]\\nAt a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion erythema migrans . [ 274 ] The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911. [ 275 ]\\nModern history [ edit ]\\nThe modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult. [ 276 ]\\nNeurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. [ 277 ] In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.\\n Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. [ 278 ] Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. [ citation needed ] Starting in 1946, facilities in Sweden experimented with treating EM rashes with substances known to kill spirochetes. [ 279 ] Einar Hollström  [ sv ] reported that \\\"penicillin was found to be the most effective.\\\" [ 280 ] In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. [ 281 ] In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe. [ 282 ] [ 283 ]\\nIn 1970 a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin. [ 284 ]\\nThe full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme , which gave the disease its popular name. [ 285 ] This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service , and by others from Yale University , including Stephen Malawista , who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. [ 286 ] The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that \\\"Lyme arthritis\\\" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe. [ 287 ]\\nBefore 1976, the elements of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius's disease, [ 288 ] Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, [ 289 ] [ 290 ] Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis. [ 291 ] [ 292 ]\\nIn 1980, Steere, et al. , began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. [ 293 ] In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer , a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory , with collections of I. dammini [ scapularis ] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed \\\"poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.\\\" Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the \\\"long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.\\\" Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour \\\"offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.\\\" Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. [ 294 ] In June 1982, he published his findings in Science , and the spirochete was named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor. [ 295 ]\\nAfter the identification of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics , amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone . [ 296 ] [ 297 ] The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands. [ 298 ]\\nSociety, culture, and controversy [ edit ]\\nLandscape changes and urbanization [ edit ]\\nUrbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents—the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector , the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. [ 301 ]\\nThe dilution effect [ edit ]\\nGiven these habitat-host dynamics, in 2003 some researchers began to postulate whether the so called dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease. [ 299 ] The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that an increase in host biodiversity will result in a decrease in the number of vectors infected with B. burgdorferi . [ 299 ] Scientific research has shown that nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) decreases as the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect. [ 299 ] That said, there is no direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven. [ 299 ] Additionally, as of 2018, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates [ 302 ]\\nChronic Lyme disease [ edit ]\\nMain article: Chronic Lyme disease\\nThe term \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, [ 303 ] and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] [ 304 ] Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with B. burgdorferi or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing non-specific symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease. [ 305 ]\\nThe 2008 documentary Under Our Skin is known for promoting controversial and unrecognized theories about \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\". [ 306 ]\\nConspiracy theories about origins [ edit ]\\nProlific but unfounded conspiracy theories have alleged that Lyme disease was a biological weapon that originated in the Plum Island laboratory , which is near Old Lyme, Connecticut. [ 307 ] A discredited 2004 book entitled Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory fueled the conspiracy theories. [ 308 ] [ 309 ] Archived specimens show that Lyme disease was endemic well before the establishment of Plum Island laboratory. [ 307 ] Additionally, Lyme disease was never a topic of research at Plum Island, according to the US Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture. [ 310 ] [ 308 ]\\nIn 2024 and 2025, conspiracy theories about the origins of Lyme disease were further spread due to attention from Robert F. Kennedy Jr . [ 311 ]\\nOther animals [ edit ]\\nDogs [ edit ]\\nPrevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step. [ 312 ]\\nAnother crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes ( Amitraz ), phenylpyrazoles ( Fipronil ), or permethrin ( pyrethroids ). [ 313 ] These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. [ 312 ] Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos. [ 313 ]\\nExamination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears. [ 314 ]\\nIn dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, [ 315 ] which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. [ 190 ] Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. [ 316 ] [ verification needed ] In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs. [ 317 ]\\nCats [ edit ]\\nUnlike dogs, it is very rare for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with B. burgdorferi , following a bite from an infected tick. Cats who are infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including but not limited to lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. [ 318 ] In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans. [ 319 ] However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be asymptomatic , and show no noticeable signs of the disease. [ 319 ] [ 318 ] Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required. [ 318 ]\\nHorses [ edit ]\\nLyme disease in horses is often challenging to diagnose because symptoms vary widely. Common acute symptoms include weight loss, fever, lameness , ataxia , and other muscle and joint-related issues. [ 320 ] [ 321 ] [ 322 ] Additional symptoms include muscle tenderness, swollen joints, arthritis , and neck stiffness. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] Chronic symptoms of the disease typically include neurological manifestations, such as meningitis , cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis , and encephalitis . [ 326 ] [ 320 ] [ 327 ] [ 328 ] Furthermore, it is important to note that some horses do not slow clinical signs of Lyme disease. [ 329 ]\\nThere are three main testing strategies used to diagnose horses with Lyme disease. They include clinical evaluation, serological testing , and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. [ 330 ] [ 331 ] [ 321 ] Detection of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine Lyme disease and unspecific testing for antibodies is not recommended. [ 332 ]\\nTypical treatment involves antibiotics such as oxytetracycline , doxycycline , ceftriaxone , or minocycline . [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 329 ] In some cases, a combination of antibiotics may be administered. Doxycycline and minocycline are taken orally, while oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are usually administered intravenously. [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 329 ] The duration and dosage of treatment vary widely among cases. In most cases, the infected horse is euthanized . [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 327 ] [ 336 ] Death of horses as a result of Borrelia burgdorferi infection remains unknown. [ 337 ]\\nCurrently, there is no approved Lyme disease vaccine for horses available. [ 338 ] However, a study demonstrated that ponies could be protected using an aluminum adjuvanted recombinant outer-surface protein A (rOspA) vaccine. [ 339 ] While horses have been administered a Lyme disease vaccine designed for dogs, it elicits only a short-lasting antibody response. [ 338 ] Another study supports the use of commercial Lyme disease vaccines, showing that they do elicit an antibody response, which can be significantly enhanced when horses receive an additional booster vaccine.

Compared to non-immunized guinea pigs, vaccinated animals exposed to infected ticks quickly developed redness at the tick bite site. None of the immunized animals developed Lyme disease if ticks were removed when redness developed. In contrast, about half of the control group became infected with B. burgdorferi after tick removal. When a single infected tick was attached to immunized guinea pigs and not removed, none of vaccinated animals were infected compared to 60 percent of control animals. However, protection waned in immunized guinea pigs if three ticks remained attached to the animal. Ticks in immunized animals were unable to feed aggressively and dislodged more quickly than those on guinea pigs in the control group.\\n^ Sajid A, Matias J, Arora G, Kurokawa C, DePonte K, Tang X, et al.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash , known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. [ 1 ] The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. [ 1 ] Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. [ 1 ] Early diagnosis can be difficult. [ 11 ] Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness . [ 1 ] If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face , joint pains , severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations . [ 1 ] Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. [ 1 ] Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. [ 1 ]\\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes . [ 12 ] In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , \\\"In most cases, a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.\\\" [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In North America, the bacterial species Borrelia burgdorferi and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease. [ 4 ] [ 16 ] In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii , Borrelia garinii , B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. [ 4 ] The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals nor through food. [ 13 ] Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. [ 5 ] [ 17 ] Blood tests are often falsely negative in the early stages of the disease. [ 4 ] Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. [ 18 ]\\nPrevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin -based insect repellents . [ 4 ] [ 9 ] Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. [ 4 ] Ticks can be removed using tweezers . [ 19 ] If the removed tick is full of blood a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent the development of infection but is not generally recommended since the development of infection is rare. [ 4 ] If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime . [ 4 ] Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. [ 4 ] Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment, which may last for one or two days. [ 4 ] In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. [ 4 ] [ 20 ]\\nLyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. [ 21 ] [ 8 ] Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. [ 4 ] Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . [ 22 ] The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer . [ 23 ] People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). [ 24 ] PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease , a term no longer supported by scientists and used in different ways by different groups. [ 20 ] [ 25 ] Some healthcare providers claim that chronic Lyme is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment. [ 26 ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] , clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced, but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. [ 27 ] There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nSigns and symptoms [ edit ]\\nLyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms.\\n20% of Lyme rashes in the United States show a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" appearance. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]\\nErythema migrans (\\\"migrating redness\\\") on a woman's neck. [ 31 ] Rashes from non-Lyme causes may look similar. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]\\nThe incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). [ 34 ] Lyme symptoms most often occur from the month of May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases. [ 34 ]\\nEarly localized infection [ edit ]\\n80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit , groin , back of the knee , or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (median is 16 cm). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] [ 32 ]\\nThe rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. [ 4 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM) which translates as \\\"migrating redness.\\\" In about 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges possibly forming a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" pattern, but this clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. [ 32 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. [ 4 ]\\nThe Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms. [ 4 ]\\nPeople with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis . [ 35 ]\\nNot everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms, and many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases. [ 36 ]\\nAsymptomatic infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States. [ 37 ] Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe. [ 38 ]\\nEarly disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nWithin days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the Borrelia bacteria may spread through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10–20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. [ 28 ] Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common. [ 28 ]\\nIn about 10–15% of untreated people, Lyme causes neurological problems known as neuroborreliosis . [ 39 ] Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4–6 weeks (range 1–12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy, and/or mononeuritis multiplex. [ 35 ] [ 40 ] Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. [ 41 ] After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms . Up to 76.5% of them present as tinnitus , the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness (53.7%) and hearing loss (16.7%) were the next most common symptoms. [ 42 ] In children, partial loss of vision may also occur. [ 35 ] Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves . When due to Lyme, it most typically causes facial palsy , impairing blinking, smiling, and chewing on one or both sides of the face. It may also cause intermittent double vision . [ 35 ] [ 41 ] Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness , numbness , or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots , e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. [ 39 ] [ 35 ] Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord , with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech , impaired movement , impaired motor planning , or shaking . [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn North America, facial palsy is the typical early neuroborreliosis presentation, occurring in 5–10% of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. [ 35 ] [ 44 ] Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. [ 45 ] In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome , accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ] In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. [ 38 ] In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%). [ 40 ]\\nIn about 4–10% of untreated cases in the United States and 0.3–4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days to 7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness , fainting , shortness of breath , and chest pain . [ 46 ] Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches , facial palsy , headaches , or radicular pain . [ 46 ] In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis in 19–87% of people adversely impacts the heart's electrical conduction system, causing atrioventricular block that often manifests as heart rhythms that alternate within minutes between abnormally slow and abnormally fast. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 10–15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly , left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure. [ 46 ]\\nAnother skin condition, found in Europe but not in North America, is borrelial lymphocytoma , a purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum . [ 48 ]\\nLate disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nLyme arthritis caused this 3-year-old girl's knee to become swollen. Though painless, it did make her limp. [ 49 ]\\nLyme arthritis occurs in up to 60% of untreated people, typically starting about six months after infection. [ 28 ] It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip , other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint . [ 35 ] [ 50 ] Usually, large joint effusion and swelling occur, but only mild or moderate pain. [ 35 ] Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time, but periodically return. [ 35 ] Baker's cysts may form and rupture.\\n In early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and over time possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis that discovered poor documentation of this manifestation, experts wondered if it exists at all in the US or is merely very rare. [ 35 ] [ 51 ]\\nA neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia , a general sense of feeling unwell , and changes in personality. [ 52 ] Lyme encephalopathy is controversial in the US and has not been reported in Europe. [ 8 ] Problems such as depression and fibromyalgia are as common in people with Lyme disease as in the general population. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] There is no compelling evidence that Lyme disease causes psychiatric disorders, behavioral disorders (e.g. ADHD ), or developmental disorders (e.g. autism ). [ 55 ]\\nAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly. [ 48 ] It begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. [ 56 ] It is also associated with peripheral neuropathy. [ 51 ]\\nCause [ edit ]\\nMain article: Lyme disease microbiology\\nFurther information: Weather and climate effects on Lyme disease exposure\\nBorrelia bacteria, the causative agents of Lyme disease, magnified\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochetes , gram-negative bacteria from the genus Borrelia . Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella . [ 57 ] The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato , and show a great deal of genetic diversity . [ 58 ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato is a species complex made up of 20 accepted and three proposed genospecies. Eight species are known to cause Lyme disease: B. mayonii (found in North America), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (found in North America and Europe), B. afzelii , B. garinii, B. spielmanii, and B. lusitaniae (all found in Eurasia ). [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 16 ] [ 10 ] Some studies have also proposed that B. valaisiana may sometimes infect humans, but this species does not seem to be an important cause of disease. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]\\nTick life cycle [ edit ]\\nDeer tick life cycle\\nIxodes scapularis , the primary vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America\\nThree stages occur in the life cycle of a tick - larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and are usually most active in late spring and early summer in regions where the climate is mild. During the adult stage, Lyme disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and tend to be larger in size, so can be easily seen and removed. [ 63 ]\\nTransmission [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is classified as a zoonosis , as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts . [ 64 ] Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia ). [ 65 ] Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage , because they are very small, thus may feed for long periods of time undetected. [ 64 ] Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. [ 66 ] Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. [ 67 ] The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected. [ 68 ] Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Borrelia from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse , and occasionally birds. [ 69 ] Areas where Lyme is common are expanding. [ 70 ]\\nWithin the tick midgut, the Borrelia ' s outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the Borrelia downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection. [ 71 ] Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC. [ 72 ]\\nTick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. [ 73 ]\\nWhile B. burgdorferi is most associated with ticks hosted by white-tailed deer and white-footed mice , Borrelia afzelii is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto . The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association. [ 74 ]\\nBudding research has suggested that B. burgdorferi sensu lato may also be able to form enzootic cycle among lizard populations; [ 75 ] this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations of lizards, such as California. Except for one study in Europe, [ 74 ] much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia , it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific. [ 79 ]\\nTick Ixodes ricinus , developmental stages\\nIn Europe, the main vector is Ixodes ricinus , which is also called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. [ 80 ] In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector. [ 81 ] In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) is the main vector on the East Coast. [ 68 ]\\nThe lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as Texas , is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes , [ 82 ] though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness , which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease. [ 83 ]\\nOn the West Coast of the United States , the main vector is the western black-legged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ). [ 84 ] The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the western fence lizard that are resistant to Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West. [ 85 ] [ 79 ]\\nTransmission can occur across the placenta during pregnancy and as with a number of other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\\nThere is no scientific evidence to support Lyme disease transmission via blood transfusion, sexual contact, or breast milk. [ 90 ]\\nTick-borne co-infections [ edit ]\\nMain article: Tick-borne disease\\nTicks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other microbes, such as Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. [ 91 ] Among people with early Lyme disease, depending on their location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–10% will have babesiosis. [ 55 ] Ticks in certain regions also transmit viruses that cause tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan virus disease . [ 92 ] [ 55 ] Co-infections of Lyme disease may not require additional treatment, since they may resolve on their own or—as in the case of HGA—can be treated with the doxycycline prescribed for Lyme. [ 35 ] Persistent fever or compatible anomalous laboratory findings may be indicative of a co-infection. [ 55 ]\\nPathophysiology [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. [ 72 ] [ 93 ] B. Burgdorferi does not produce toxins. [ 94 ] Therefore, many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to spirochete in those tissues. [ 95 ]\\nB. burgdorferi is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. [ 96 ] Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. [ 97 ] This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis . The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. [ 72 ] Neutrophils , however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body. [ 98 ]\\nDays to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete. [ 99 ]\\nIf untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. [ 100 ] The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement , and hiding in the extracellular matrix , which may interfere with the function of immune factors. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]\\nImmunological studies [ edit ]\\nExposure to the Borrelia bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging inflammatory response , [ 103 ] a form of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease. [ 104 ] The production of this reaction might be due to a form of molecular mimicry , where Borrelia avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]\\nChronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever , but its wider application is controversial. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash, facial palsy , or arthritis ), history of possible exposure to infected ticks , and possibly laboratory tests . [ 4 ] [ 28 ] People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1–2 months. [ 35 ] Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common , within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull's eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms. [ 4 ] [ 111 ] In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota , but it is expanding into other areas. [ 70 ] Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk. [ 112 ]\\nIn the absence of an EM rash or history of tick exposure, Lyme diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation. [ 65 ] [ 113 ] The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time-consuming to grow in the laboratory. [ 4 ] [ 65 ] The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. [ 114 ] A positive antibody test result does not by itself prove active infection but can confirm an infection that is suspected because of symptoms, objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. [ 65 ] Because as many as 5–20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be tested for Lyme antibodies: a positive result would likely be false, possibly causing unnecessary treatment. [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available. [ 44 ] [ 115 ]\\nLaboratory testing [ edit ]\\nTests for antibodies in the blood by ELISA and Western blot is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. [ 116 ] The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2–4 weeks and 4–6 weeks, and peak at 6–8 weeks. [ 117 ] When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. [ 35 ] Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. [ 117 ] A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false-positive result. [ 118 ] The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4–6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years. [ 117 ]\\nOther tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii and almost always involves lymphocytic pleocytosis , i.e. the densities of lymphocytes (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Demonstration by lumbar puncture and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans , which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). [ 40 ] In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative. [ 119 ] American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat. [ 43 ] In infection involving the PNS, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment. [ 41 ]\\nIn Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography may show myocardial dysfunction. [ 46 ] Biopsy and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure. [ 46 ]\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material ( DNA ) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia . PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. [ 121 ] [ 40 ] Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during infection. [ 122 ] [ 40 ] Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid. [ 123 ] Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people. [ 40 ]\\nSeveral other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. OspA antigens , shed by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. [ 124 ] The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years. [ 127 ]\\nThe CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of B. burgdorferi , and lymphocyte transformation tests. [ 122 ]\\nImaging [ edit ]\\nNeuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis , but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. [ 128 ] Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vasculitis and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease , which makes them questionable. [ 129 ]\\nDifferential diagnosis [ edit ]\\nCommunity clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23–28% of erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. [ 113 ] EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites , cellulitis , or shingles . [ 113 ] Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull's eye. [ 4 ] Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2–3 cm/day and a diameter of at least 5 cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. [ 28 ] [ 32 ] Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee. [ 28 ] Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve's dermatome , and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. [ 130 ]\\nFacial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy . [ 44 ] Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. [ 44 ] Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. [ 44 ] Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. [ 44 ] Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. [ 44 ]\\nUnlike viral meningitis , Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy , or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF . [ 35 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the limbs is often misdiagnosed as a radiculopathy caused by nerve root compression, such as sciatica . [ 113 ] [ 131 ] Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4–6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating risks of other possible causes that, although less frequent, require immediate diagnosis and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. [ 132 ] A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms of lymphocytic meningitis, or facial palsy would lead to suspicion of Lyme disease and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation. [ 132 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and acute coronary syndrome . [ 45 ] [ 113 ] Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new \\\"great imitator\\\". [ 133 ] As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms. [ 134 ]\\nPrevention [ edit ]\\nTick bites may be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. [ 135 ] [ 9 ]\\nMost Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. [ 28 ] [ 135 ] Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands , shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. [ 28 ] [ 136 ] Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\\\"quest\\\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. [ 138 ] In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. [ 137 ] Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. [ 137 ] [ 135 ] In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. [ 137 ] Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. [ 137 ] [ 139 ] Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. [ 136 ]\\nAs a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. [ 135 ] [ 140 ] Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. [ 141 ] After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). [ 141 ] Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. [ 139 ] Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. [ 139 ] Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. [ 142 ] Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. [ 140 ] Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. [ 140 ] [ 143 ]\\nThe EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET , picaridin , IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD) . [ 135 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. [ 140 ] The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. [ 145 ] Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. [ 145 ] Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. [ 140 ] [ 144 ] Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). [ 140 ] [ 135 ] If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. [ 140 ] Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. [ 140 ]\\nAfter coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. [ 135 ] Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or warm dryer are not enough). [ 135 ] Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduce risk of infection. [ 135 ] Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister . [ 146 ] The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair. [ 135 ]\\nTick removal [ edit ]\\nRemoval of a tick using tweezers\\nAttached ticks should be removed promptly. Risk of infection increases with time of attachment, but in North America risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. [ 147 ] CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from the skin without twisting, jerking, squeezing or crushing the tick. [ 148 ] After tick removal, any tick parts remaining in the skin should be removed with a clean tweezer, if possible. [ 148 ] The wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. [ 148 ] The tick may be disposed by placing it in a container with alcohol, sealed bag, tape or flushed down the toilet. [ 148 ] The bitten person should write down where and when the bite happened so that this can be informed to a doctor if the person gets a rash or flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. [ 148 ] CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it. [ 148 ]\\nIn Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. [ 149 ] Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. [ 149 ] Another method consists in using about 20 cm of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]\\nPreventive antibiotics [ edit ]\\nThe risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. [ 28 ] It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. [ 28 ] If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70–80% of people infected). [ 4 ] [ 28 ]\\nGarden landscaping [ edit ]\\nSeveral landscaping practices may reduce the risk of tick bites in residential yards. [ 146 ] [ 152 ] These include keeping lawns mown, removing leaf litter and weeds and avoiding the use of ground cover. [ 146 ] A 3-ft-wide rock or woodchip barrier is recommended to separate lawns from wood piles, woodlands , stone walls and shrubs. [ 152 ] Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it to kill ticks. [ 152 ] A sun-exposed tick-safe zone at least 9 ft from the barrier should concentrate human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. [ 152 ] Materials such as wood decking, concrete, bricks, gravel or woodchips used on the ground under patios and playgrounds would discourage ticks there. [ 146 ] An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone. [ 152 ] [ 146 ]\\nOccupational exposure [ edit ]\\nOutdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active. [ 155 ]\\nHost animals [ edit ]\\nTicks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards , birds , mice , cats , dogs , deer , cattle and humans . The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \\\"dilution hosts\\\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and so decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. White-tailed deer are both a food source and a \\\"reproductive host\\\", where ticks tend to mate. [ 156 ] The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. Availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted. [ 157 ]\\nIn the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine , [ 158 ] and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. [ 159 ] Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. [ 160 ] While these studies have found these effects, other studies have found opposite effects. A study done in Massachusetts removed deer and did not see a significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. [ 161 ] Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to effectively control tick populations. [ 162 ] One study summarized the results of multiple studies all looking at deer reduction controlling tick populations and determined that deer control can't be used as a standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that since most of the studies looking at this are not good representatives of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. [ 163 ] There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen, would decrease Lyme disease risk the most. [ 164 ]\\nOthers have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not Borrelia burgdorferi reservoirs. This is because it was found that white-tailed deer blood actually kills the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. [ 165 ] Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks , may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission. [ 157 ]\\nTick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. [ 166 ] They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals through the use of acaricides has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on a number of grounds. Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment. [ 167 ]\\nIn Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). [ 168 ] These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. [ 168 ] \\\"The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus ; [ 169 ] \\\" it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi \\\" thought Jaenson & al. (1992) [ 170 ] (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, [ 171 ] as red deer and wild boars ( Sus scrofa ), [ 169 ] in which one Rickettsia and three Borrelia species were identified\\\", [ 169 ] with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. [ 172 ] Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe \\\" two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified \\\". [ 169 ]\\nVaccination [ edit ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] no human vaccines for Lyme disease were available. [ 27 ] The only human vaccine to advance to market was LYMErix, which was available from 1998, but discontinued in 2002. [ 173 ] The vaccine candidate VLA15 was scheduled to start a phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2022, with other research ongoing. Multiple vaccines are available for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nLYMErix [ edit ]\\nThe vaccine LYMErix was available from 1998 to 2002. The recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, was developed by SmithKline Beecham . In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine was found to confer protective immunity to Lyme disease in 76% of adults after three doses with only mild or moderate and transient adverse effects . [ 174 ] [ 175 ] On 21 December 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix on the basis of these trials for persons of ages 15 through 70. [ 175 ] [ 173 ]\\nFollowing approval of the vaccine , its entry into clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. [ 176 ] Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline , alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints. [ 177 ]\\nDespite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, [ 178 ] in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. [ 177 ] [ 179 ] The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a \\\"cautionary tale\\\"; [ 179 ] an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which \\\"unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.\\\" [ 180 ] The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told Nature : \\\"This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.\\\" [ 177 ] [ 181 ]\\nVLA15 [ edit ]\\nThe hexavalent (OspA) protein subunit-based vaccine candidate VLA15 was developed by Valneva . It was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017. [ 182 ] [ 183 ] In April 2020 Pfizer paid $130 million for the rights to the vaccine, and the companies are developing it together, performing multiple phase 2 trials. [ 184 ]\\nA phase 3 trial of VLA15 was scheduled for late 2022, recruiting volunteers at test sites located across the northeastern United States and in Europe. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Participants were scheduled to receive an initial three-dose series of vaccines over the course of five to nine months, followed by a booster dose after twelve months, with both the initial series and the booster dose scheduled to be complete before the year's peak Lyme disease season. [ 186 ]\\nOther research [ edit ]\\nAn mRNA vaccine designed to cause a strong fast immune response to tick saliva allowed the immune system to detect and remove the ticks from test animals before they were able to transmit the infectious bacteria. [ 187 ] The vaccine contains mRNAs for the body to build 19 proteins in tick saliva which, by enabling quick development of erythema (itchy redness) at the bite site, protects guinea pigs against Lyme disease. It also protected the test animals if the tick is not removed if only one tick, but not three, remain attached. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\\nCanine vaccines [ edit ]\\nCanine vaccines have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet- Schering-Plough 's vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA . The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial , generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog. [ 190 ]\\nTreatment [ edit ]\\nAntibiotics are the primary treatment. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. [ 28 ] For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. [ 28 ] People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns . [ 35 ] Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; [ 28 ] alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , and azithromycin . [ 28 ] Azithromycin is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. [ 35 ] The standard treatment for cellulitis , cephalexin , is not useful for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , as these are effective against both infections. [ 35 ] Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy , radiculopathy , meningitis , or peripheral neuropathy . [ 28 ] Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; [ 28 ] cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives. [ 28 ]\\nTreatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7–14 days in early localized disease, to 14–21 days in early disseminated disease to 14–28 days in late disseminated disease. [ 55 ] Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. [ 120 ] In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone . [ 120 ] Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. [ 28 ] [ 35 ] Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no evidence shows it to be effective. [ 28 ] [ 191 ] IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. [ 28 ] As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. [ 28 ]\\nFacial palsy may resolve without treatment: however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. [ 35 ] Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. [ 44 ] In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. [ 44 ] [ 192 ]\\nAbout a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids. [ 46 ]\\nPeople with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping should use crutches. [ 193 ] Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [ 35 ] Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. [ 35 ] [ 193 ] People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for Borrelia DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. [ 35 ] [ 55 ] [ 193 ] Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy , or physical therapy. [ 55 ] [ 193 ]\\nPeople receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it . [ 115 ]\\nPrognosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease's typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. [ 4 ] However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues. [ 35 ]\\nPeople who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. [ 113 ] Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64–71% at end of treatment for EM rash to about 84–90% after 30 months; higher percentages are reported in Europe. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Treatment failure, i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. [ 194 ] Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g. joint or muscle pains or fatigue . [ 196 ] These symptoms are usually mild and nondisabling. [ 196 ]\\nPeople treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits, in addition to subjective symptoms. [ 35 ] In Europe, an average of 32–33 months after initial Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14–21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with only an EM rash (16%). [ 197 ] In another European study, 5 years after treatment for neuroborreliosis lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter were less common among those treated within 30 days of the first symptom (16%) than among those treated later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated. [ 198 ]\\nSome data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] However, in Europe 41% of people treated for facial palsy had other lingering symptoms at followup up to 6 months later, including 28% with numbness or altered sensation and 14% with fatigue or concentration problems. [ 200 ] Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. [ 199 ] [ 201 ] Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another one is voluntarily moved) can become evident only 6–12 months after facial palsy appears to be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. [ 202 ] Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. [ 202 ] In longer-term follow-up, 16–23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover. [ 202 ]\\nIn Europe, about a quarter of people with Bannwarth syndrome (Lyme radiculopathy and lymphocytic meningitis ) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3–6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection in cerebrospinal fluid ; after 12 months, 64% recovered fully, 31% had nondisabling mild or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or required substantial use of analgesics. [ 43 ] The most common lingering nondisabling symptoms were headache, fatigue , altered sensation , joint pains , memory disturbances, malaise , radicular pain , sleep disturbances, muscle pains , and concentration disturbances. Lingering disabling symptoms included facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ]\\nRecovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage. [ 35 ]\\nAbout half the people with Lyme carditis progress to complete heart block , but it usually resolves in a week. [ 46 ] Other Lyme heart conduction abnormalities resolve typically within 6 weeks. [ 46 ] About 94% of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). [ 46 ] Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. [ 46 ] However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal. [ 46 ]\\nRecommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several months for inflammation to resolve and a second round of antibiotics is often necessary. [ 35 ] Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9–14 months (range 4 months – 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery. [ 193 ]\\nReinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6–11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. [ 194 ] The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain. [ 203 ]\\nPost-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [ edit ]\\nChronic symptoms like pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment are experienced by 5–20% of people who contract Lyme disease, even after completing treatment. This is called Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. [ 24 ] [ 204 ]\\nThe cause is unknown. One hypothesis is that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains. However, human and animal trials have not provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. [ 205 ] Another hypothesis is that autoimmunity has been triggered by the infection. Auto–immune responses are known to occur following other infections, including Campylobacter ( Guillain-Barré syndrome ), Chlamydia (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease). A third hypothesis is that debris from \\na previous infection could remain. [ 205 ]\\nAnother hypothesis is that symptoms are simply unrelated to a Lyme infection. [ 206 ] [ 207 ] In studies of people who presented to clinics with concerns about Lyme disease, 47 to 80% had no evidence of Lyme infection while 15 to 55% (median 34%) were able to obtain other diagnoses. [ 205 ]\\nThere is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective in early Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotics are not. They have been shown ineffective in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and is similar to the management of fibromyalgia or ME/CFS . PTLDS usually gets better over time, but recovery may take many months. [ 206 ]\\nEpidemiology and prevalence [ edit ]\\nCountries with reported Lyme disease cases\\nOverview [ edit ]\\nLyme disease occurs regularly in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. [ 208 ]\\nLyme disease effects are comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds.\\n An estimated 476,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated for the disease in the United States. This number is probably an overestimate due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated in Europe. [ 8 ] [ 4 ] [ 209 ]\\nThere is a suggestion that tick populations and Lyme disease occurrence are increasing and spreading into new areas, owing in part to the warming temperatures of climate change . [ 210 ] However, tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. [ 157 ] [ 211 ]\\nNorth America [ edit ]\\nMany studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of I. scapularis projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S. [ 212 ] A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. [ 213 ] The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology . [ 213 ]\\nUnited States [ edit ]\\nCDC map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the Northeast Megalopolis and western Wisconsin\\nLyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ]\\nAlthough Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). [ 90 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria has been modified multiple times. [ 219 ] The 2022 surveillance case definition classifies cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect. [ 220 ] The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.\\n The CDC emphasizes that, while surveillance data has limitations, it is useful due to \\\"uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness.\\\" While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted. [ 221 ] [ 90 ]\\nSeveral similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), also known as Masters disease. Amblyomma americanum , known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment. [ 222 ]\\nIn recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever. [ 218 ]\\nCanada [ edit ]\\nThe range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. [ 112 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] A model-based prediction by Leighton et al. (2012) suggests that the range of the I. scapularis tick will expand into Canada by 46 km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread. [ 226 ]\\nEurope [ edit ]\\nIn Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete B. burgdorferi sensu lato , mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus . [ 227 ] Cases of B. burgdorferi sensu lato -infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. [ 228 ] The number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. [ 229 ] Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising. [ 230 ] Lyme disease is rare in Iceland. On average around 6 to 7 cases are diagnosed every year, primarily localised infections presenting as erythema migrans. None of the cases had a definitive Icelandic origin and the yearly number of cases has not been increasing. [ 231 ]\\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\\nIn the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986 [ 232 ] when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Ireland combined. [ 233 ] In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, [ 234 ] but 973 in 2009 [ 232 ] and 953 in 2010. [ 235 ] Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010. [ 236 ]\\nIt is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year [ 235 ] (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas [ 232 ] ), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 \\\"to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor.\\\" [ 237 ] [ 238 ]\\nDespite Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi infection) being a notifiable disease in Scotland [ 239 ] since January 1990 [ 240 ] which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. [ 241 ] Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. [ 232 ]\\nAlthough there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest , Salisbury Plain , Exmoor , the South Downs , parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire , Thetford Forest [ 242 ] and the West coast and islands of Scotland, [ 243 ] infected ticks are widespread and can even be found in the parks of London. [ 234 ] [ 244 ] A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive , as were between 2% and 4–5% of the general local population of the area. [ 245 ] [ 246 ]\\nTests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] It is speculated that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. [ 249 ] However no published research has proven this to be so.\\nSouth America [ edit ]\\nIn Brazil, Lyme disease is not considered endemic. [ 250 ] A Lyme-like disease known as Baggio–Yoshinari syndrome has been described, attributed to microorganisms that do not belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted by ticks of the Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera. [ 251 ] The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia , São Paulo. [ 252 ] A 2024 analysis concluded that evidence to connect BYS to Borrelia bacteria was lacking. [ 250 ]\\nMexico [ edit ]\\nA 2007 study suggests Borrelia burgdorferi infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000. [ 253 ]\\nAfrica [ edit ]\\nIn northern Africa, B. burgdorferi sensu lato has been identified in Morocco , Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia . [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ]\\nLyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this region. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of Lyme infection in Africa. [ 257 ] In East Africa, two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya . [ 258 ] According The Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa, Lyme disease is not known to be endemic in either South Africa or Mozambique. [ 259 ]\\nAsia [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato -infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China, Nepal , Thailand and far eastern Russia. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Borrelia has also been isolated in Mongolia . [ 262 ]\\nAustraliasia [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is not considered endemic to Australia. [ 263 ] While there have been reports of people acquiring Lyme disease in Australia, and even evidence of closely related Borrelia species in ticks, [ 264 ] the evidence linking these cases to local transmission is limited. Ongoing research on resolving potential Borrelia species to Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT) in Australia are ongoing. [ 265 ]\\nEtymology [ edit ]\\nLyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . [ 266 ]\\nHistory [ edit ]\\nEarly evidence [ edit ]\\nThe earliest known evidence of Lyme disease was found in Oetzi , a 5300 year old mummy in the Eastern Alps near the Italian border. [ 267 ] \\nThe evolutionary history of Borrelia burgdorferi genetics has been examined by scientists. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the Midwest that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. [ 268 ]\\nJohn Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663 to 1670, wrote \\\"there be infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\\\" [ 269 ]\\nThis is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm , a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus , and who found the forests of New York \\\"abound\\\" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. [ 270 ]\\nPerhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. [ 271 ] He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \\\"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\\\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \\\"worm\\\" with a body which is \\\"of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\\\" that \\\"penetrates the skin\\\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. [ 272 ]\\nThe examination of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. [ 270 ] The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman , a 5,300-year-old mummy , revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. [ 273 ]\\nThe early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau , Germany (now Wrocław , Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who for 16 years had had a degenerative skin disorder now known as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans . [ 274 ]\\nAt a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion erythema migrans . [ 274 ] The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911. [ 275 ]\\nModern history [ edit ]\\nThe modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult. [ 276 ]\\nNeurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. [ 277 ] In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.\\n Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. [ 278 ] Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. [ citation needed ] Starting in 1946, facilities in Sweden experimented with treating EM rashes with substances known to kill spirochetes. [ 279 ] Einar Hollström  [ sv ] reported that \\\"penicillin was found to be the most effective.\\\" [ 280 ] In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. [ 281 ] In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe. [ 282 ] [ 283 ]\\nIn 1970 a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin. [ 284 ]\\nThe full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme , which gave the disease its popular name. [ 285 ] This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service , and by others from Yale University , including Stephen Malawista , who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. [ 286 ] The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that \\\"Lyme arthritis\\\" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe. [ 287 ]\\nBefore 1976, the elements of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius's disease, [ 288 ] Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, [ 289 ] [ 290 ] Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis. [ 291 ] [ 292 ]\\nIn 1980, Steere, et al. , began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. [ 293 ] In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer , a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory , with collections of I. dammini [ scapularis ] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed \\\"poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.\\\" Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the \\\"long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.\\\" Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour \\\"offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.\\\" Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. [ 294 ] In June 1982, he published his findings in Science , and the spirochete was named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor. [ 295 ]\\nAfter the identification of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics , amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone . [ 296 ] [ 297 ] The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands. [ 298 ]\\nSociety, culture, and controversy [ edit ]\\nLandscape changes and urbanization [ edit ]\\nUrbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents—the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector , the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. [ 301 ]\\nThe dilution effect [ edit ]\\nGiven these habitat-host dynamics, in 2003 some researchers began to postulate whether the so called dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease. [ 299 ] The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that an increase in host biodiversity will result in a decrease in the number of vectors infected with B. burgdorferi . [ 299 ] Scientific research has shown that nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) decreases as the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect. [ 299 ] That said, there is no direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven. [ 299 ] Additionally, as of 2018, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates [ 302 ]\\nChronic Lyme disease [ edit ]\\nMain article: Chronic Lyme disease\\nThe term \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, [ 303 ] and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] [ 304 ] Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with B. burgdorferi or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing non-specific symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease. [ 305 ]\\nThe 2008 documentary Under Our Skin is known for promoting controversial and unrecognized theories about \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\". [ 306 ]\\nConspiracy theories about origins [ edit ]\\nProlific but unfounded conspiracy theories have alleged that Lyme disease was a biological weapon that originated in the Plum Island laboratory , which is near Old Lyme, Connecticut. [ 307 ] A discredited 2004 book entitled Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory fueled the conspiracy theories. [ 308 ] [ 309 ] Archived specimens show that Lyme disease was endemic well before the establishment of Plum Island laboratory. [ 307 ] Additionally, Lyme disease was never a topic of research at Plum Island, according to the US Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture. [ 310 ] [ 308 ]\\nIn 2024 and 2025, conspiracy theories about the origins of Lyme disease were further spread due to attention from Robert F. Kennedy Jr . [ 311 ]\\nOther animals [ edit ]\\nDogs [ edit ]\\nPrevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step. [ 312 ]\\nAnother crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes ( Amitraz ), phenylpyrazoles ( Fipronil ), or permethrin ( pyrethroids ). [ 313 ] These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. [ 312 ] Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos. [ 313 ]\\nExamination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears. [ 314 ]\\nIn dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, [ 315 ] which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. [ 190 ] Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. [ 316 ] [ verification needed ] In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs. [ 317 ]\\nCats [ edit ]\\nUnlike dogs, it is very rare for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with B. burgdorferi , following a bite from an infected tick. Cats who are infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including but not limited to lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. [ 318 ] In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans. [ 319 ] However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be asymptomatic , and show no noticeable signs of the disease. [ 319 ] [ 318 ] Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required. [ 318 ]\\nHorses [ edit ]\\nLyme disease in horses is often challenging to diagnose because symptoms vary widely. Common acute symptoms include weight loss, fever, lameness , ataxia , and other muscle and joint-related issues. [ 320 ] [ 321 ] [ 322 ] Additional symptoms include muscle tenderness, swollen joints, arthritis , and neck stiffness. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] Chronic symptoms of the disease typically include neurological manifestations, such as meningitis , cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis , and encephalitis . [ 326 ] [ 320 ] [ 327 ] [ 328 ] Furthermore, it is important to note that some horses do not slow clinical signs of Lyme disease. [ 329 ]\\nThere are three main testing strategies used to diagnose horses with Lyme disease. They include clinical evaluation, serological testing , and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. [ 330 ] [ 331 ] [ 321 ] Detection of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine Lyme disease and unspecific testing for antibodies is not recommended. [ 332 ]\\nTypical treatment involves antibiotics such as oxytetracycline , doxycycline , ceftriaxone , or minocycline . [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 329 ] In some cases, a combination of antibiotics may be administered. Doxycycline and minocycline are taken orally, while oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are usually administered intravenously. [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 329 ] The duration and dosage of treatment vary widely among cases. In most cases, the infected horse is euthanized . [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 327 ] [ 336 ] Death of horses as a result of Borrelia burgdorferi infection remains unknown. [ 337 ]\\nCurrently, there is no approved Lyme disease vaccine for horses available. [ 338 ] However, a study demonstrated that ponies could be protected using an aluminum adjuvanted recombinant outer-surface protein A (rOspA) vaccine. [ 339 ] While horses have been administered a Lyme disease vaccine designed for dogs, it elicits only a short-lasting antibody response. [ 338 ] Another study supports the use of commercial Lyme disease vaccines, showing that they do elicit an antibody response, which can be significantly enhanced when horses receive an additional booster vaccine.

Compared to non-immunized guinea pigs, vaccinated animals exposed to infected ticks quickly developed redness at the tick bite site. None of the immunized animals developed Lyme disease if ticks were removed when redness developed. In contrast, about half of the control group became infected with B. burgdorferi after tick removal. When a single infected tick was attached to immunized guinea pigs and not removed, none of vaccinated animals were infected compared to 60 percent of control animals. However, protection waned in immunized guinea pigs if three ticks remained attached to the animal. Ticks in immunized animals were unable to feed aggressively and dislodged more quickly than those on guinea pigs in the control group.\\n^ Sajid A, Matias J, Arora G, Kurokawa C, DePonte K, Tang X, et al.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash , known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. [ 1 ] The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. [ 1 ] Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. [ 1 ] Early diagnosis can be difficult. [ 11 ] Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness . [ 1 ] If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face , joint pains , severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations . [ 1 ] Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. [ 1 ] Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. [ 1 ]\\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes . [ 12 ] In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , \\\"In most cases, a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.\\\" [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In North America, the bacterial species Borrelia burgdorferi and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease. [ 4 ] [ 16 ] In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii , Borrelia garinii , B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. [ 4 ] The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals nor through food. [ 13 ] Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. [ 5 ] [ 17 ] Blood tests are often falsely negative in the early stages of the disease. [ 4 ] Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. [ 18 ]\\nPrevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin -based insect repellents . [ 4 ] [ 9 ] Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. [ 4 ] Ticks can be removed using tweezers . [ 19 ] If the removed tick is full of blood a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent the development of infection but is not generally recommended since the development of infection is rare. [ 4 ] If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime . [ 4 ] Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. [ 4 ] Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment, which may last for one or two days. [ 4 ] In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. [ 4 ] [ 20 ]\\nLyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. [ 21 ] [ 8 ] Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. [ 4 ] Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . [ 22 ] The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer . [ 23 ] People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). [ 24 ] PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease , a term no longer supported by scientists and used in different ways by different groups. [ 20 ] [ 25 ] Some healthcare providers claim that chronic Lyme is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment. [ 26 ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] , clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced, but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. [ 27 ] There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nSigns and symptoms [ edit ]\\nLyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms.\\n20% of Lyme rashes in the United States show a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" appearance. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]\\nErythema migrans (\\\"migrating redness\\\") on a woman's neck. [ 31 ] Rashes from non-Lyme causes may look similar. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]\\nThe incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). [ 34 ] Lyme symptoms most often occur from the month of May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases. [ 34 ]\\nEarly localized infection [ edit ]\\n80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit , groin , back of the knee , or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (median is 16 cm). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] [ 32 ]\\nThe rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. [ 4 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM) which translates as \\\"migrating redness.\\\" In about 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges possibly forming a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" pattern, but this clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. [ 32 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. [ 4 ]\\nThe Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms. [ 4 ]\\nPeople with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis . [ 35 ]\\nNot everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms, and many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases. [ 36 ]\\nAsymptomatic infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States. [ 37 ] Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe. [ 38 ]\\nEarly disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nWithin days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the Borrelia bacteria may spread through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10–20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. [ 28 ] Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common. [ 28 ]\\nIn about 10–15% of untreated people, Lyme causes neurological problems known as neuroborreliosis . [ 39 ] Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4–6 weeks (range 1–12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy, and/or mononeuritis multiplex. [ 35 ] [ 40 ] Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. [ 41 ] After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms . Up to 76.5% of them present as tinnitus , the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness (53.7%) and hearing loss (16.7%) were the next most common symptoms. [ 42 ] In children, partial loss of vision may also occur. [ 35 ] Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves . When due to Lyme, it most typically causes facial palsy , impairing blinking, smiling, and chewing on one or both sides of the face. It may also cause intermittent double vision . [ 35 ] [ 41 ] Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness , numbness , or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots , e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. [ 39 ] [ 35 ] Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord , with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech , impaired movement , impaired motor planning , or shaking . [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn North America, facial palsy is the typical early neuroborreliosis presentation, occurring in 5–10% of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. [ 35 ] [ 44 ] Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. [ 45 ] In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome , accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ] In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. [ 38 ] In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%). [ 40 ]\\nIn about 4–10% of untreated cases in the United States and 0.3–4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days to 7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness , fainting , shortness of breath , and chest pain . [ 46 ] Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches , facial palsy , headaches , or radicular pain . [ 46 ] In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis in 19–87% of people adversely impacts the heart's electrical conduction system, causing atrioventricular block that often manifests as heart rhythms that alternate within minutes between abnormally slow and abnormally fast. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 10–15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly , left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure. [ 46 ]\\nAnother skin condition, found in Europe but not in North America, is borrelial lymphocytoma , a purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum . [ 48 ]\\nLate disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nLyme arthritis caused this 3-year-old girl's knee to become swollen. Though painless, it did make her limp. [ 49 ]\\nLyme arthritis occurs in up to 60% of untreated people, typically starting about six months after infection. [ 28 ] It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip , other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint . [ 35 ] [ 50 ] Usually, large joint effusion and swelling occur, but only mild or moderate pain. [ 35 ] Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time, but periodically return. [ 35 ] Baker's cysts may form and rupture.\\n In early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and over time possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis that discovered poor documentation of this manifestation, experts wondered if it exists at all in the US or is merely very rare. [ 35 ] [ 51 ]\\nA neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia , a general sense of feeling unwell , and changes in personality. [ 52 ] Lyme encephalopathy is controversial in the US and has not been reported in Europe. [ 8 ] Problems such as depression and fibromyalgia are as common in people with Lyme disease as in the general population. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] There is no compelling evidence that Lyme disease causes psychiatric disorders, behavioral disorders (e.g. ADHD ), or developmental disorders (e.g. autism ). [ 55 ]\\nAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly. [ 48 ] It begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. [ 56 ] It is also associated with peripheral neuropathy. [ 51 ]\\nCause [ edit ]\\nMain article: Lyme disease microbiology\\nFurther information: Weather and climate effects on Lyme disease exposure\\nBorrelia bacteria, the causative agents of Lyme disease, magnified\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochetes , gram-negative bacteria from the genus Borrelia . Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella . [ 57 ] The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato , and show a great deal of genetic diversity . [ 58 ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato is a species complex made up of 20 accepted and three proposed genospecies. Eight species are known to cause Lyme disease: B. mayonii (found in North America), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (found in North America and Europe), B. afzelii , B. garinii, B. spielmanii, and B. lusitaniae (all found in Eurasia ). [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 16 ] [ 10 ] Some studies have also proposed that B. valaisiana may sometimes infect humans, but this species does not seem to be an important cause of disease. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]\\nTick life cycle [ edit ]\\nDeer tick life cycle\\nIxodes scapularis , the primary vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America\\nThree stages occur in the life cycle of a tick - larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and are usually most active in late spring and early summer in regions where the climate is mild. During the adult stage, Lyme disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and tend to be larger in size, so can be easily seen and removed. [ 63 ]\\nTransmission [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is classified as a zoonosis , as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts . [ 64 ] Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia ). [ 65 ] Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage , because they are very small, thus may feed for long periods of time undetected. [ 64 ] Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. [ 66 ] Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. [ 67 ] The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected. [ 68 ] Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Borrelia from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse , and occasionally birds. [ 69 ] Areas where Lyme is common are expanding. [ 70 ]\\nWithin the tick midgut, the Borrelia ' s outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the Borrelia downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection. [ 71 ] Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC. [ 72 ]\\nTick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. [ 73 ]\\nWhile B. burgdorferi is most associated with ticks hosted by white-tailed deer and white-footed mice , Borrelia afzelii is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto . The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association. [ 74 ]\\nBudding research has suggested that B. burgdorferi sensu lato may also be able to form enzootic cycle among lizard populations; [ 75 ] this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations of lizards, such as California. Except for one study in Europe, [ 74 ] much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia , it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific. [ 79 ]\\nTick Ixodes ricinus , developmental stages\\nIn Europe, the main vector is Ixodes ricinus , which is also called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. [ 80 ] In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector. [ 81 ] In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) is the main vector on the East Coast. [ 68 ]\\nThe lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as Texas , is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes , [ 82 ] though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness , which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease. [ 83 ]\\nOn the West Coast of the United States , the main vector is the western black-legged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ). [ 84 ] The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the western fence lizard that are resistant to Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West. [ 85 ] [ 79 ]\\nTransmission can occur across the placenta during pregnancy and as with a number of other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\\nThere is no scientific evidence to support Lyme disease transmission via blood transfusion, sexual contact, or breast milk. [ 90 ]\\nTick-borne co-infections [ edit ]\\nMain article: Tick-borne disease\\nTicks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other microbes, such as Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. [ 91 ] Among people with early Lyme disease, depending on their location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–10% will have babesiosis. [ 55 ] Ticks in certain regions also transmit viruses that cause tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan virus disease . [ 92 ] [ 55 ] Co-infections of Lyme disease may not require additional treatment, since they may resolve on their own or—as in the case of HGA—can be treated with the doxycycline prescribed for Lyme. [ 35 ] Persistent fever or compatible anomalous laboratory findings may be indicative of a co-infection. [ 55 ]\\nPathophysiology [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. [ 72 ] [ 93 ] B. Burgdorferi does not produce toxins. [ 94 ] Therefore, many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to spirochete in those tissues. [ 95 ]\\nB. burgdorferi is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. [ 96 ] Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. [ 97 ] This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis . The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. [ 72 ] Neutrophils , however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body. [ 98 ]\\nDays to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete. [ 99 ]\\nIf untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. [ 100 ] The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement , and hiding in the extracellular matrix , which may interfere with the function of immune factors. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]\\nImmunological studies [ edit ]\\nExposure to the Borrelia bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging inflammatory response , [ 103 ] a form of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease. [ 104 ] The production of this reaction might be due to a form of molecular mimicry , where Borrelia avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]\\nChronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever , but its wider application is controversial. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash, facial palsy , or arthritis ), history of possible exposure to infected ticks , and possibly laboratory tests . [ 4 ] [ 28 ] People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1–2 months. [ 35 ] Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common , within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull's eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms. [ 4 ] [ 111 ] In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota , but it is expanding into other areas. [ 70 ] Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk. [ 112 ]\\nIn the absence of an EM rash or history of tick exposure, Lyme diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation. [ 65 ] [ 113 ] The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time-consuming to grow in the laboratory. [ 4 ] [ 65 ] The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. [ 114 ] A positive antibody test result does not by itself prove active infection but can confirm an infection that is suspected because of symptoms, objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. [ 65 ] Because as many as 5–20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be tested for Lyme antibodies: a positive result would likely be false, possibly causing unnecessary treatment. [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available. [ 44 ] [ 115 ]\\nLaboratory testing [ edit ]\\nTests for antibodies in the blood by ELISA and Western blot is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. [ 116 ] The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2–4 weeks and 4–6 weeks, and peak at 6–8 weeks. [ 117 ] When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. [ 35 ] Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. [ 117 ] A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false-positive result. [ 118 ] The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4–6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years. [ 117 ]\\nOther tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii and almost always involves lymphocytic pleocytosis , i.e. the densities of lymphocytes (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Demonstration by lumbar puncture and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans , which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). [ 40 ] In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative. [ 119 ] American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat. [ 43 ] In infection involving the PNS, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment. [ 41 ]\\nIn Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography may show myocardial dysfunction. [ 46 ] Biopsy and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure. [ 46 ]\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material ( DNA ) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia . PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. [ 121 ] [ 40 ] Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during infection. [ 122 ] [ 40 ] Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid. [ 123 ] Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people. [ 40 ]\\nSeveral other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. OspA antigens , shed by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. [ 124 ] The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years. [ 127 ]\\nThe CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of B. burgdorferi , and lymphocyte transformation tests. [ 122 ]\\nImaging [ edit ]\\nNeuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis , but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. [ 128 ] Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vasculitis and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease , which makes them questionable. [ 129 ]\\nDifferential diagnosis [ edit ]\\nCommunity clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23–28% of erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. [ 113 ] EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites , cellulitis , or shingles . [ 113 ] Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull's eye. [ 4 ] Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2–3 cm/day and a diameter of at least 5 cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. [ 28 ] [ 32 ] Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee. [ 28 ] Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve's dermatome , and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. [ 130 ]\\nFacial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy . [ 44 ] Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. [ 44 ] Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. [ 44 ] Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. [ 44 ] Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. [ 44 ]\\nUnlike viral meningitis , Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy , or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF . [ 35 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the limbs is often misdiagnosed as a radiculopathy caused by nerve root compression, such as sciatica . [ 113 ] [ 131 ] Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4–6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating risks of other possible causes that, although less frequent, require immediate diagnosis and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. [ 132 ] A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms of lymphocytic meningitis, or facial palsy would lead to suspicion of Lyme disease and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation. [ 132 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and acute coronary syndrome . [ 45 ] [ 113 ] Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new \\\"great imitator\\\". [ 133 ] As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms. [ 134 ]\\nPrevention [ edit ]\\nTick bites may be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. [ 135 ] [ 9 ]\\nMost Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. [ 28 ] [ 135 ] Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands , shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. [ 28 ] [ 136 ] Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\\\"quest\\\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. [ 138 ] In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. [ 137 ] Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. [ 137 ] [ 135 ] In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. [ 137 ] Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. [ 137 ] [ 139 ] Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. [ 136 ]\\nAs a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. [ 135 ] [ 140 ] Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. [ 141 ] After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). [ 141 ] Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. [ 139 ] Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. [ 139 ] Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. [ 142 ] Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. [ 140 ] Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. [ 140 ] [ 143 ]\\nThe EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET , picaridin , IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD) . [ 135 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. [ 140 ] The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. [ 145 ] Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. [ 145 ] Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. [ 140 ] [ 144 ] Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). [ 140 ] [ 135 ] If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. [ 140 ] Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. [ 140 ]\\nAfter coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. [ 135 ] Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or warm dryer are not enough). [ 135 ] Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduce risk of infection. [ 135 ] Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister . [ 146 ] The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair. [ 135 ]\\nTick removal [ edit ]\\nRemoval of a tick using tweezers\\nAttached ticks should be removed promptly. Risk of infection increases with time of attachment, but in North America risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. [ 147 ] CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from the skin without twisting, jerking, squeezing or crushing the tick. [ 148 ] After tick removal, any tick parts remaining in the skin should be removed with a clean tweezer, if possible. [ 148 ] The wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. [ 148 ] The tick may be disposed by placing it in a container with alcohol, sealed bag, tape or flushed down the toilet. [ 148 ] The bitten person should write down where and when the bite happened so that this can be informed to a doctor if the person gets a rash or flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. [ 148 ] CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it. [ 148 ]\\nIn Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. [ 149 ] Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. [ 149 ] Another method consists in using about 20 cm of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]\\nPreventive antibiotics [ edit ]\\nThe risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. [ 28 ] It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. [ 28 ] If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70–80% of people infected). [ 4 ] [ 28 ]\\nGarden landscaping [ edit ]\\nSeveral landscaping practices may reduce the risk of tick bites in residential yards. [ 146 ] [ 152 ] These include keeping lawns mown, removing leaf litter and weeds and avoiding the use of ground cover. [ 146 ] A 3-ft-wide rock or woodchip barrier is recommended to separate lawns from wood piles, woodlands , stone walls and shrubs. [ 152 ] Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it to kill ticks. [ 152 ] A sun-exposed tick-safe zone at least 9 ft from the barrier should concentrate human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. [ 152 ] Materials such as wood decking, concrete, bricks, gravel or woodchips used on the ground under patios and playgrounds would discourage ticks there. [ 146 ] An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone. [ 152 ] [ 146 ]\\nOccupational exposure [ edit ]\\nOutdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active. [ 155 ]\\nHost animals [ edit ]\\nTicks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards , birds , mice , cats , dogs , deer , cattle and humans . The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \\\"dilution hosts\\\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and so decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. White-tailed deer are both a food source and a \\\"reproductive host\\\", where ticks tend to mate. [ 156 ] The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. Availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted. [ 157 ]\\nIn the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine , [ 158 ] and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. [ 159 ] Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. [ 160 ] While these studies have found these effects, other studies have found opposite effects. A study done in Massachusetts removed deer and did not see a significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. [ 161 ] Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to effectively control tick populations. [ 162 ] One study summarized the results of multiple studies all looking at deer reduction controlling tick populations and determined that deer control can't be used as a standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that since most of the studies looking at this are not good representatives of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. [ 163 ] There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen, would decrease Lyme disease risk the most. [ 164 ]\\nOthers have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not Borrelia burgdorferi reservoirs. This is because it was found that white-tailed deer blood actually kills the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. [ 165 ] Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks , may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission. [ 157 ]\\nTick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. [ 166 ] They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals through the use of acaricides has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on a number of grounds. Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment. [ 167 ]\\nIn Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). [ 168 ] These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. [ 168 ] \\\"The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus ; [ 169 ] \\\" it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi \\\" thought Jaenson & al. (1992) [ 170 ] (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, [ 171 ] as red deer and wild boars ( Sus scrofa ), [ 169 ] in which one Rickettsia and three Borrelia species were identified\\\", [ 169 ] with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. [ 172 ] Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe \\\" two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified \\\". [ 169 ]\\nVaccination [ edit ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] no human vaccines for Lyme disease were available. [ 27 ] The only human vaccine to advance to market was LYMErix, which was available from 1998, but discontinued in 2002. [ 173 ] The vaccine candidate VLA15 was scheduled to start a phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2022, with other research ongoing. Multiple vaccines are available for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nLYMErix [ edit ]\\nThe vaccine LYMErix was available from 1998 to 2002. The recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, was developed by SmithKline Beecham . In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine was found to confer protective immunity to Lyme disease in 76% of adults after three doses with only mild or moderate and transient adverse effects . [ 174 ] [ 175 ] On 21 December 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix on the basis of these trials for persons of ages 15 through 70. [ 175 ] [ 173 ]\\nFollowing approval of the vaccine , its entry into clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. [ 176 ] Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline , alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints. [ 177 ]\\nDespite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, [ 178 ] in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. [ 177 ] [ 179 ] The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a \\\"cautionary tale\\\"; [ 179 ] an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which \\\"unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.\\\" [ 180 ] The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told Nature : \\\"This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.\\\" [ 177 ] [ 181 ]\\nVLA15 [ edit ]\\nThe hexavalent (OspA) protein subunit-based vaccine candidate VLA15 was developed by Valneva . It was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017. [ 182 ] [ 183 ] In April 2020 Pfizer paid $130 million for the rights to the vaccine, and the companies are developing it together, performing multiple phase 2 trials. [ 184 ]\\nA phase 3 trial of VLA15 was scheduled for late 2022, recruiting volunteers at test sites located across the northeastern United States and in Europe. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Participants were scheduled to receive an initial three-dose series of vaccines over the course of five to nine months, followed by a booster dose after twelve months, with both the initial series and the booster dose scheduled to be complete before the year's peak Lyme disease season. [ 186 ]\\nOther research [ edit ]\\nAn mRNA vaccine designed to cause a strong fast immune response to tick saliva allowed the immune system to detect and remove the ticks from test animals before they were able to transmit the infectious bacteria. [ 187 ] The vaccine contains mRNAs for the body to build 19 proteins in tick saliva which, by enabling quick development of erythema (itchy redness) at the bite site, protects guinea pigs against Lyme disease. It also protected the test animals if the tick is not removed if only one tick, but not three, remain attached. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\\nCanine vaccines [ edit ]\\nCanine vaccines have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet- Schering-Plough 's vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA . The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial , generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog. [ 190 ]\\nTreatment [ edit ]\\nAntibiotics are the primary treatment. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. [ 28 ] For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. [ 28 ] People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns . [ 35 ] Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; [ 28 ] alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , and azithromycin . [ 28 ] Azithromycin is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. [ 35 ] The standard treatment for cellulitis , cephalexin , is not useful for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , as these are effective against both infections. [ 35 ] Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy , radiculopathy , meningitis , or peripheral neuropathy . [ 28 ] Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; [ 28 ] cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives. [ 28 ]\\nTreatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7–14 days in early localized disease, to 14–21 days in early disseminated disease to 14–28 days in late disseminated disease. [ 55 ] Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. [ 120 ] In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone . [ 120 ] Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. [ 28 ] [ 35 ] Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no evidence shows it to be effective. [ 28 ] [ 191 ] IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. [ 28 ] As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. [ 28 ]\\nFacial palsy may resolve without treatment: however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. [ 35 ] Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. [ 44 ] In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. [ 44 ] [ 192 ]\\nAbout a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids. [ 46 ]\\nPeople with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping should use crutches. [ 193 ] Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [ 35 ] Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. [ 35 ] [ 193 ] People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for Borrelia DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. [ 35 ] [ 55 ] [ 193 ] Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy , or physical therapy. [ 55 ] [ 193 ]\\nPeople receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it . [ 115 ]\\nPrognosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease's typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. [ 4 ] However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues. [ 35 ]\\nPeople who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. [ 113 ] Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64–71% at end of treatment for EM rash to about 84–90% after 30 months; higher percentages are reported in Europe. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Treatment failure, i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. [ 194 ] Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g. joint or muscle pains or fatigue . [ 196 ] These symptoms are usually mild and nondisabling. [ 196 ]\\nPeople treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits, in addition to subjective symptoms. [ 35 ] In Europe, an average of 32–33 months after initial Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14–21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with only an EM rash (16%). [ 197 ] In another European study, 5 years after treatment for neuroborreliosis lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter were less common among those treated within 30 days of the first symptom (16%) than among those treated later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated. [ 198 ]\\nSome data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] However, in Europe 41% of people treated for facial palsy had other lingering symptoms at followup up to 6 months later, including 28% with numbness or altered sensation and 14% with fatigue or concentration problems. [ 200 ] Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. [ 199 ] [ 201 ] Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another one is voluntarily moved) can become evident only 6–12 months after facial palsy appears to be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. [ 202 ] Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. [ 202 ] In longer-term follow-up, 16–23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover. [ 202 ]\\nIn Europe, about a quarter of people with Bannwarth syndrome (Lyme radiculopathy and lymphocytic meningitis ) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3–6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection in cerebrospinal fluid ; after 12 months, 64% recovered fully, 31% had nondisabling mild or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or required substantial use of analgesics. [ 43 ] The most common lingering nondisabling symptoms were headache, fatigue , altered sensation , joint pains , memory disturbances, malaise , radicular pain , sleep disturbances, muscle pains , and concentration disturbances. Lingering disabling symptoms included facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ]\\nRecovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage. [ 35 ]\\nAbout half the people with Lyme carditis progress to complete heart block , but it usually resolves in a week. [ 46 ] Other Lyme heart conduction abnormalities resolve typically within 6 weeks. [ 46 ] About 94% of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). [ 46 ] Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. [ 46 ] However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal. [ 46 ]\\nRecommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several months for inflammation to resolve and a second round of antibiotics is often necessary. [ 35 ] Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9–14 months (range 4 months – 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery. [ 193 ]\\nReinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6–11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. [ 194 ] The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain. [ 203 ]\\nPost-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [ edit ]\\nChronic symptoms like pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment are experienced by 5–20% of people who contract Lyme disease, even after completing treatment. This is called Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. [ 24 ] [ 204 ]\\nThe cause is unknown. One hypothesis is that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains. However, human and animal trials have not provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. [ 205 ] Another hypothesis is that autoimmunity has been triggered by the infection. Auto–immune responses are known to occur following other infections, including Campylobacter ( Guillain-Barré syndrome ), Chlamydia (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease). A third hypothesis is that debris from \\na previous infection could remain. [ 205 ]\\nAnother hypothesis is that symptoms are simply unrelated to a Lyme infection. [ 206 ] [ 207 ] In studies of people who presented to clinics with concerns about Lyme disease, 47 to 80% had no evidence of Lyme infection while 15 to 55% (median 34%) were able to obtain other diagnoses. [ 205 ]\\nThere is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective in early Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotics are not. They have been shown ineffective in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and is similar to the management of fibromyalgia or ME/CFS . PTLDS usually gets better over time, but recovery may take many months. [ 206 ]\\nEpidemiology and prevalence [ edit ]\\nCountries with reported Lyme disease cases\\nOverview [ edit ]\\nLyme disease occurs regularly in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. [ 208 ]\\nLyme disease effects are comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds.\\n An estimated 476,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated for the disease in the United States. This number is probably an overestimate due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated in Europe. [ 8 ] [ 4 ] [ 209 ]\\nThere is a suggestion that tick populations and Lyme disease occurrence are increasing and spreading into new areas, owing in part to the warming temperatures of climate change . [ 210 ] However, tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. [ 157 ] [ 211 ]\\nNorth America [ edit ]\\nMany studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of I. scapularis projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S. [ 212 ] A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. [ 213 ] The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology . [ 213 ]\\nUnited States [ edit ]\\nCDC map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the Northeast Megalopolis and western Wisconsin\\nLyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ]\\nAlthough Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). [ 90 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria has been modified multiple times. [ 219 ] The 2022 surveillance case definition classifies cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect. [ 220 ] The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.\\n The CDC emphasizes that, while surveillance data has limitations, it is useful due to \\\"uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness.\\\" While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted. [ 221 ] [ 90 ]\\nSeveral similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), also known as Masters disease. Amblyomma americanum , known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment. [ 222 ]\\nIn recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever. [ 218 ]\\nCanada [ edit ]\\nThe range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. [ 112 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] A model-based prediction by Leighton et al. (2012) suggests that the range of the I. scapularis tick will expand into Canada by 46 km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread. [ 226 ]\\nEurope [ edit ]\\nIn Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete B. burgdorferi sensu lato , mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus . [ 227 ] Cases of B. burgdorferi sensu lato -infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. [ 228 ] The number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. [ 229 ] Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising. [ 230 ] Lyme disease is rare in Iceland. On average around 6 to 7 cases are diagnosed every year, primarily localised infections presenting as erythema migrans. None of the cases had a definitive Icelandic origin and the yearly number of cases has not been increasing. [ 231 ]\\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\\nIn the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986 [ 232 ] when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Ireland combined. [ 233 ] In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, [ 234 ] but 973 in 2009 [ 232 ] and 953 in 2010. [ 235 ] Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010. [ 236 ]\\nIt is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year [ 235 ] (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas [ 232 ] ), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 \\\"to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor.\\\" [ 237 ] [ 238 ]\\nDespite Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi infection) being a notifiable disease in Scotland [ 239 ] since January 1990 [ 240 ] which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. [ 241 ] Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. [ 232 ]\\nAlthough there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest , Salisbury Plain , Exmoor , the South Downs , parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire , Thetford Forest [ 242 ] and the West coast and islands of Scotland, [ 243 ] infected ticks are widespread and can even be found in the parks of London. [ 234 ] [ 244 ] A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive , as were between 2% and 4–5% of the general local population of the area. [ 245 ] [ 246 ]\\nTests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] It is speculated that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. [ 249 ] However no published research has proven this to be so.\\nSouth America [ edit ]\\nIn Brazil, Lyme disease is not considered endemic. [ 250 ] A Lyme-like disease known as Baggio–Yoshinari syndrome has been described, attributed to microorganisms that do not belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted by ticks of the Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera. [ 251 ] The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia , São Paulo. [ 252 ] A 2024 analysis concluded that evidence to connect BYS to Borrelia bacteria was lacking. [ 250 ]\\nMexico [ edit ]\\nA 2007 study suggests Borrelia burgdorferi infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000. [ 253 ]\\nAfrica [ edit ]\\nIn northern Africa, B. burgdorferi sensu lato has been identified in Morocco , Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia . [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ]\\nLyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this region. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of Lyme infection in Africa. [ 257 ] In East Africa, two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya . [ 258 ] According The Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa, Lyme disease is not known to be endemic in either South Africa or Mozambique. [ 259 ]\\nAsia [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato -infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China, Nepal , Thailand and far eastern Russia. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Borrelia has also been isolated in Mongolia . [ 262 ]\\nAustraliasia [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is not considered endemic to Australia. [ 263 ] While there have been reports of people acquiring Lyme disease in Australia, and even evidence of closely related Borrelia species in ticks, [ 264 ] the evidence linking these cases to local transmission is limited. Ongoing research on resolving potential Borrelia species to Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT) in Australia are ongoing. [ 265 ]\\nEtymology [ edit ]\\nLyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . [ 266 ]\\nHistory [ edit ]\\nEarly evidence [ edit ]\\nThe earliest known evidence of Lyme disease was found in Oetzi , a 5300 year old mummy in the Eastern Alps near the Italian border. [ 267 ] \\nThe evolutionary history of Borrelia burgdorferi genetics has been examined by scientists. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the Midwest that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. [ 268 ]\\nJohn Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663 to 1670, wrote \\\"there be infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\\\" [ 269 ]\\nThis is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm , a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus , and who found the forests of New York \\\"abound\\\" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. [ 270 ]\\nPerhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. [ 271 ] He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \\\"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\\\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \\\"worm\\\" with a body which is \\\"of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\\\" that \\\"penetrates the skin\\\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. [ 272 ]\\nThe examination of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. [ 270 ] The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman , a 5,300-year-old mummy , revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. [ 273 ]\\nThe early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau , Germany (now Wrocław , Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who for 16 years had had a degenerative skin disorder now known as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans . [ 274 ]\\nAt a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion erythema migrans . [ 274 ] The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911. [ 275 ]\\nModern history [ edit ]\\nThe modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult. [ 276 ]\\nNeurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. [ 277 ] In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.\\n Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. [ 278 ] Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. [ citation needed ] Starting in 1946, facilities in Sweden experimented with treating EM rashes with substances known to kill spirochetes. [ 279 ] Einar Hollström  [ sv ] reported that \\\"penicillin was found to be the most effective.\\\" [ 280 ] In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. [ 281 ] In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe. [ 282 ] [ 283 ]\\nIn 1970 a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin. [ 284 ]\\nThe full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme , which gave the disease its popular name. [ 285 ] This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service , and by others from Yale University , including Stephen Malawista , who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. [ 286 ] The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that \\\"Lyme arthritis\\\" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe. [ 287 ]\\nBefore 1976, the elements of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius's disease, [ 288 ] Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, [ 289 ] [ 290 ] Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis. [ 291 ] [ 292 ]\\nIn 1980, Steere, et al. , began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. [ 293 ] In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer , a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory , with collections of I. dammini [ scapularis ] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed \\\"poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.\\\" Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the \\\"long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.\\\" Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour \\\"offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.\\\" Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. [ 294 ] In June 1982, he published his findings in Science , and the spirochete was named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor. [ 295 ]\\nAfter the identification of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics , amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone . [ 296 ] [ 297 ] The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands. [ 298 ]\\nSociety, culture, and controversy [ edit ]\\nLandscape changes and urbanization [ edit ]\\nUrbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents—the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector , the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. [ 301 ]\\nThe dilution effect [ edit ]\\nGiven these habitat-host dynamics, in 2003 some researchers began to postulate whether the so called dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease. [ 299 ] The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that an increase in host biodiversity will result in a decrease in the number of vectors infected with B. burgdorferi . [ 299 ] Scientific research has shown that nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) decreases as the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect. [ 299 ] That said, there is no direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven. [ 299 ] Additionally, as of 2018, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates [ 302 ]\\nChronic Lyme disease [ edit ]\\nMain article: Chronic Lyme disease\\nThe term \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, [ 303 ] and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] [ 304 ] Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with B. burgdorferi or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing non-specific symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease. [ 305 ]\\nThe 2008 documentary Under Our Skin is known for promoting controversial and unrecognized theories about \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\". [ 306 ]\\nConspiracy theories about origins [ edit ]\\nProlific but unfounded conspiracy theories have alleged that Lyme disease was a biological weapon that originated in the Plum Island laboratory , which is near Old Lyme, Connecticut. [ 307 ] A discredited 2004 book entitled Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory fueled the conspiracy theories. [ 308 ] [ 309 ] Archived specimens show that Lyme disease was endemic well before the establishment of Plum Island laboratory. [ 307 ] Additionally, Lyme disease was never a topic of research at Plum Island, according to the US Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture. [ 310 ] [ 308 ]\\nIn 2024 and 2025, conspiracy theories about the origins of Lyme disease were further spread due to attention from Robert F. Kennedy Jr . [ 311 ]\\nOther animals [ edit ]\\nDogs [ edit ]\\nPrevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step. [ 312 ]\\nAnother crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes ( Amitraz ), phenylpyrazoles ( Fipronil ), or permethrin ( pyrethroids ). [ 313 ] These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. [ 312 ] Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos. [ 313 ]\\nExamination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears. [ 314 ]\\nIn dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, [ 315 ] which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. [ 190 ] Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. [ 316 ] [ verification needed ] In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs. [ 317 ]\\nCats [ edit ]\\nUnlike dogs, it is very rare for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with B. burgdorferi , following a bite from an infected tick. Cats who are infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including but not limited to lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. [ 318 ] In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans. [ 319 ] However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be asymptomatic , and show no noticeable signs of the disease. [ 319 ] [ 318 ] Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required. [ 318 ]\\nHorses [ edit ]\\nLyme disease in horses is often challenging to diagnose because symptoms vary widely. Common acute symptoms include weight loss, fever, lameness , ataxia , and other muscle and joint-related issues. [ 320 ] [ 321 ] [ 322 ] Additional symptoms include muscle tenderness, swollen joints, arthritis , and neck stiffness. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] Chronic symptoms of the disease typically include neurological manifestations, such as meningitis , cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis , and encephalitis . [ 326 ] [ 320 ] [ 327 ] [ 328 ] Furthermore, it is important to note that some horses do not slow clinical signs of Lyme disease. [ 329 ]\\nThere are three main testing strategies used to diagnose horses with Lyme disease. They include clinical evaluation, serological testing , and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. [ 330 ] [ 331 ] [ 321 ] Detection of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine Lyme disease and unspecific testing for antibodies is not recommended. [ 332 ]\\nTypical treatment involves antibiotics such as oxytetracycline , doxycycline , ceftriaxone , or minocycline . [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 329 ] In some cases, a combination of antibiotics may be administered. Doxycycline and minocycline are taken orally, while oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are usually administered intravenously. [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 329 ] The duration and dosage of treatment vary widely among cases. In most cases, the infected horse is euthanized . [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 327 ] [ 336 ] Death of horses as a result of Borrelia burgdorferi infection remains unknown. [ 337 ]\\nCurrently, there is no approved Lyme disease vaccine for horses available. [ 338 ] However, a study demonstrated that ponies could be protected using an aluminum adjuvanted recombinant outer-surface protein A (rOspA) vaccine. [ 339 ] While horses have been administered a Lyme disease vaccine designed for dogs, it elicits only a short-lasting antibody response. [ 338 ] Another study supports the use of commercial Lyme disease vaccines, showing that they do elicit an antibody response, which can be significantly enhanced when horses receive an additional booster vaccine.

Compared to non-immunized guinea pigs, vaccinated animals exposed to infected ticks quickly developed redness at the tick bite site. None of the immunized animals developed Lyme disease if ticks were removed when redness developed. In contrast, about half of the control group became infected with B. burgdorferi after tick removal. When a single infected tick was attached to immunized guinea pigs and not removed, none of vaccinated animals were infected compared to 60 percent of control animals. However, protection waned in immunized guinea pigs if three ticks remained attached to the animal. Ticks in immunized animals were unable to feed aggressively and dislodged more quickly than those on guinea pigs in the control group.\\n^ Sajid A, Matias J, Arora G, Kurokawa C, DePonte K, Tang X, et al.

What is Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi , which you can get if an infected deer tick (also called black-legged tick) bites you. Ordinary \\\"wood ticks\\\" and \\\"dog ticks\\\" don’t carry the infection. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy The first recognition of Lyme disease, also called borreliosis, began in 1975 when many children received a diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Lyme, Connecticut, and two neighboring towns. Researchers found that bites from infected deer ticks were responsible for the outbreak of arthritis. What are the stages (phases) of Lyme disease? Lyme disease may evolve through phases (stages), which can overlap and cause symptoms that may involve the skin, joints, heart or nervous system. These stages are: Early localized Lyme disease (weeks one through four). Early disseminated Lyme disease (months one through four). Late persistent, late disseminated or just late Lyme disease (after four months, even up to years later). How common is Lyme disease? In the United States, about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year. But there are other, diagnosed cases that aren't reported. Signs and Symptoms What are the symptoms of Lyme disease? Signs and symptoms of early Lyme disease typically include: A reddish ras h or skin lesion known as erythema migraines (EM). The rash starts as a small red spot at the site of the tick bite anywhere from one week after to four weeks after the bite. The spot expands over a period of days or weeks, forming a circular, triangular or oval-shaped rash. The rash may look like a bull’s eye because it appears as a red ring that surrounds a clear center area. The rash can range in size from that of a dime to the entire width of a person's back. As infection spreads, several EM rashes (lesions) can appear at different sites on your body. Fever . Headache . Stiff neck. Body and joint aches. Fatigue . Swollen lymph nodes (swollen glands). Advertisement Signs and symptoms of the second stage of Lyme disease (the early disseminated stage) may include: Multiple areas of rash. Paralysis of facial muscles ( Bell's palsy ). Heart block or an interruption of the electrical system of the heart. Areas of numbness or abnormal feelings ( neuropathy ). Signs and symptoms of untreated late Lyme disease, which may happen from months to a year after infection, may include: Recurring episodes of swollen joints ( arthritis ). This typically affects large joints like the knee. Difficulty concentrating, known as “brain fog.” This is a form of encephalopathy or damage to the brain. Damage to nerves all over your body, including your skin, muscles and organs (polyneuropathy). Diagnosis and Tests How is Lyme disease diagnosed? A healthcare provider will diagnose Lyme disease based on symptoms, physical findings (like a rash) and whether or not you've been in an area populated by infected ticks. Many people don’t remember or know that they’ve been bitten by a tick. This is because the tick is tiny, and its bite is usually painless. Your provider will confirm the diagnosis using a blood test. If your first blood test is negative for Lyme disease, you won't need another test. If the first test is positive or equivocal, your provider will conduct the test again. You have to have two positive (or sometimes equivocal) results to be diagnosed with Lyme disease. Management and Treatment How is Lyme disease treated? Antibiotics , usually doxycycline or amoxicillin, are effective treatments for Lyme disease. How long your treatment lasts depends on the stage of infection. In general, it’s true that the sooner you’re treated, the quicker and more complete the recovery. Pregnant women should receive treatment for Lyme disease as well. There is, however, no evidence that a fetus can get the infection from its birth mother. There’s also no strong evidence that miscarriages are more likely after Lyme disease. What should I do if a tick bites me? If a tick bites you, the best way to remove it is by taking the following steps: Tug gently but firmly with blunt tweezers near the \\\"head\\\" of the tick at the level of your skin until it releases its hold on your skin. Avoid crushing the tick's body or handling the tick with bare fingers because you could expose yourself to the bacteria in the tick. Wash the bite area thoroughly with soap and water. Don't use kerosene, petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline®) or hot cigarette butts to remove the tick. Don't squeeze the tick's body with your fingers or tweezers. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can Lyme disease be prevented? Most people with Lyme disease get the infection during the late spring, summer and early fall when immature ticks are out feeding. In warm climates, few tick bites take place during winter months. Advertisement Deer ticks are most often found in wooded areas and nearby grasslands. They’re especially common where the two areas merge, including neighborhood yards where deer occasionally roam. Ticks don’t survive long on sunny lawns. They dry out quickly and die. Although only about 1% of all deer ticks carry Lyme disease-causing bacteria, there are areas in which over 50% of the ticks carry the bacterium. The diseased ticks are often found in the U.S. Northeast and upper Midwest areas. Ticks also live in coastal areas. Black-legged ticks can get the infection from animals other than deer. Mice, voles and some squirrels can carry the bacteria. How can I prevent tick bites? The following tips can help you avoid tick bites: To repel ticks, you may want to spray your clothing with permethrin, an insecticide commonly found in lawn and garden stores. Insect repellents that contain a chemical called DEET can also be applied to clothing or directly onto your skin. Read the labels carefully. Don’t overuse it. Too much may be harmful. Minimize skin exposure to both ticks and insect repellents by wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts that fit tightly at the ankles and wrists. Wear a hat, tuck your pant legs into socks and wear shoes that leave no part of your feet exposed. Wear light-colored clothing to make it easier to detect ticks. Walk in the center of trails to avoid picking up ticks from overhanging grass and brush. After outdoor activities in an \\\"at risk\\\" area, always do a tick check and then shower, scrubbing with a washcloth. Get rid of any ticks on your clothes by putting them in the dryer for 15 minutes. This will kill any ticks attached to the clothes by drying them out. Pets may bring ticks into your home. Discuss ways to prevent ticks on your pet with your veterinarian. Advertisement Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for someone with Lyme disease? Most of the people who get Lyme disease and receive treatment early will be fine. Treatment can cure Lyme disease but you might still have some long-term effects. Untreated Lyme disease may contribute to other serious problems but it’s rarely fatal. Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome Even after proper treatment, some people (estimated at 5% to 15%) may experience lingering fatigue, achiness or headaches. This is known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome or PTLDS. The symptoms don’t mean that you still have an infection. PTLDS probably won’t respond to additional antibiotics. The majority of people in this group will have symptoms that resolve at some point over the next six months. Chronic Lyme disease Chronic Lyme disease is a term used by some for a condition in a person who had Lyme disease and the symptoms of PTLDS. Some people consider chronic Lyme disease to be the same as PTLDS. However, some people receive a chronic Lyme disease diagnosis without a Lyme disease diagnosis. Sometimes, extended treatment with antibiotics helps. This term may be why some people think a Lyme disease infection can occur without being bitten by a tick. There isn't enough proof that mosquitoes can transmit Lyme disease. Many researchers dislike using the term “chronic Lyme disease.” Advertisement Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? If you feel sick after having spent time in areas where ticks might live, you should make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If you received a Lyme disease diagnosis and you don’t feel well after taking all of your antibiotics, contact your provider. This is especially true if you have symptoms like a stiff neck or mental confusion. Additional Common Questions Can Lyme disease completely be cured? Taking oral antibiotics typically cures Lyme disease after two to four weeks. You may need to get antibiotics through the vein (intravenously) for four more weeks. However, there’s no reason to think that Lyme disease stays in you forever after treatment. A note from Cleveland Clinic If you’re going to spend time in an area that might have ticks, take measures to avoid being bitten. This includes wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants to make it harder for ticks to bite. If you feel sick after being in an area that probably has ticks, make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If your provider prescribes antibiotics, make sure you take all of them as instructed. Care at Cleveland Clinic Cleveland Clinic’s primary care providers offer lifelong medical care.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash , known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. [ 1 ] The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. [ 1 ] Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. [ 1 ] Early diagnosis can be difficult. [ 11 ] Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness . [ 1 ] If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face , joint pains , severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations . [ 1 ] Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. [ 1 ] Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. [ 1 ]\\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes . [ 12 ] In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , \\\"In most cases, a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.\\\" [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In North America, the bacterial species Borrelia burgdorferi and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease. [ 4 ] [ 16 ] In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii , Borrelia garinii , B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. [ 4 ] The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals nor through food. [ 13 ] Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. [ 5 ] [ 17 ] Blood tests are often falsely negative in the early stages of the disease. [ 4 ] Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. [ 18 ]\\nPrevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin -based insect repellents . [ 4 ] [ 9 ] Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. [ 4 ] Ticks can be removed using tweezers . [ 19 ] If the removed tick is full of blood a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent the development of infection but is not generally recommended since the development of infection is rare. [ 4 ] If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime . [ 4 ] Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. [ 4 ] Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment, which may last for one or two days. [ 4 ] In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. [ 4 ] [ 20 ]\\nLyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. [ 21 ] [ 8 ] Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. [ 4 ] Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . [ 22 ] The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer . [ 23 ] People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). [ 24 ] PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease , a term no longer supported by scientists and used in different ways by different groups. [ 20 ] [ 25 ] Some healthcare providers claim that chronic Lyme is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment. [ 26 ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] , clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced, but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. [ 27 ] There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nSigns and symptoms [ edit ]\\nLyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms.\\n20% of Lyme rashes in the United States show a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" appearance. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]\\nErythema migrans (\\\"migrating redness\\\") on a woman's neck. [ 31 ] Rashes from non-Lyme causes may look similar. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]\\nThe incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). [ 34 ] Lyme symptoms most often occur from the month of May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases. [ 34 ]\\nEarly localized infection [ edit ]\\n80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit , groin , back of the knee , or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (median is 16 cm). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] [ 32 ]\\nThe rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. [ 4 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM) which translates as \\\"migrating redness.\\\" In about 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges possibly forming a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" pattern, but this clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. [ 32 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. [ 4 ]\\nThe Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms. [ 4 ]\\nPeople with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis . [ 35 ]\\nNot everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms, and many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases. [ 36 ]\\nAsymptomatic infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States. [ 37 ] Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe. [ 38 ]\\nEarly disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nWithin days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the Borrelia bacteria may spread through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10–20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. [ 28 ] Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common. [ 28 ]\\nIn about 10–15% of untreated people, Lyme causes neurological problems known as neuroborreliosis . [ 39 ] Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4–6 weeks (range 1–12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy, and/or mononeuritis multiplex. [ 35 ] [ 40 ] Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. [ 41 ] After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms . Up to 76.5% of them present as tinnitus , the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness (53.7%) and hearing loss (16.7%) were the next most common symptoms. [ 42 ] In children, partial loss of vision may also occur. [ 35 ] Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves . When due to Lyme, it most typically causes facial palsy , impairing blinking, smiling, and chewing on one or both sides of the face. It may also cause intermittent double vision . [ 35 ] [ 41 ] Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness , numbness , or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots , e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. [ 39 ] [ 35 ] Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord , with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech , impaired movement , impaired motor planning , or shaking . [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn North America, facial palsy is the typical early neuroborreliosis presentation, occurring in 5–10% of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. [ 35 ] [ 44 ] Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. [ 45 ] In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome , accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ] In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. [ 38 ] In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%). [ 40 ]\\nIn about 4–10% of untreated cases in the United States and 0.3–4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days to 7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness , fainting , shortness of breath , and chest pain . [ 46 ] Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches , facial palsy , headaches , or radicular pain . [ 46 ] In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis in 19–87% of people adversely impacts the heart's electrical conduction system, causing atrioventricular block that often manifests as heart rhythms that alternate within minutes between abnormally slow and abnormally fast. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 10–15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly , left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure. [ 46 ]\\nAnother skin condition, found in Europe but not in North America, is borrelial lymphocytoma , a purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum . [ 48 ]\\nLate disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nLyme arthritis caused this 3-year-old girl's knee to become swollen. Though painless, it did make her limp. [ 49 ]\\nLyme arthritis occurs in up to 60% of untreated people, typically starting about six months after infection. [ 28 ] It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip , other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint . [ 35 ] [ 50 ] Usually, large joint effusion and swelling occur, but only mild or moderate pain. [ 35 ] Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time, but periodically return. [ 35 ] Baker's cysts may form and rupture.\\n In early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and over time possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis that discovered poor documentation of this manifestation, experts wondered if it exists at all in the US or is merely very rare. [ 35 ] [ 51 ]\\nA neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia , a general sense of feeling unwell , and changes in personality. [ 52 ] Lyme encephalopathy is controversial in the US and has not been reported in Europe. [ 8 ] Problems such as depression and fibromyalgia are as common in people with Lyme disease as in the general population. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] There is no compelling evidence that Lyme disease causes psychiatric disorders, behavioral disorders (e.g. ADHD ), or developmental disorders (e.g. autism ). [ 55 ]\\nAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly. [ 48 ] It begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. [ 56 ] It is also associated with peripheral neuropathy. [ 51 ]\\nCause [ edit ]\\nMain article: Lyme disease microbiology\\nFurther information: Weather and climate effects on Lyme disease exposure\\nBorrelia bacteria, the causative agents of Lyme disease, magnified\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochetes , gram-negative bacteria from the genus Borrelia . Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella . [ 57 ] The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato , and show a great deal of genetic diversity . [ 58 ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato is a species complex made up of 20 accepted and three proposed genospecies. Eight species are known to cause Lyme disease: B. mayonii (found in North America), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (found in North America and Europe), B. afzelii , B. garinii, B. spielmanii, and B. lusitaniae (all found in Eurasia ). [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 16 ] [ 10 ] Some studies have also proposed that B. valaisiana may sometimes infect humans, but this species does not seem to be an important cause of disease. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]\\nTick life cycle [ edit ]\\nDeer tick life cycle\\nIxodes scapularis , the primary vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America\\nThree stages occur in the life cycle of a tick - larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and are usually most active in late spring and early summer in regions where the climate is mild. During the adult stage, Lyme disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and tend to be larger in size, so can be easily seen and removed. [ 63 ]\\nTransmission [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is classified as a zoonosis , as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts . [ 64 ] Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia ). [ 65 ] Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage , because they are very small, thus may feed for long periods of time undetected. [ 64 ] Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. [ 66 ] Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. [ 67 ] The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected. [ 68 ] Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Borrelia from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse , and occasionally birds. [ 69 ] Areas where Lyme is common are expanding. [ 70 ]\\nWithin the tick midgut, the Borrelia ' s outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the Borrelia downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection. [ 71 ] Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC. [ 72 ]\\nTick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. [ 73 ]\\nWhile B. burgdorferi is most associated with ticks hosted by white-tailed deer and white-footed mice , Borrelia afzelii is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto . The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association. [ 74 ]\\nBudding research has suggested that B. burgdorferi sensu lato may also be able to form enzootic cycle among lizard populations; [ 75 ] this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations of lizards, such as California. Except for one study in Europe, [ 74 ] much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia , it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific. [ 79 ]\\nTick Ixodes ricinus , developmental stages\\nIn Europe, the main vector is Ixodes ricinus , which is also called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. [ 80 ] In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector. [ 81 ] In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) is the main vector on the East Coast. [ 68 ]\\nThe lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as Texas , is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes , [ 82 ] though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness , which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease. [ 83 ]\\nOn the West Coast of the United States , the main vector is the western black-legged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ). [ 84 ] The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the western fence lizard that are resistant to Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West. [ 85 ] [ 79 ]\\nTransmission can occur across the placenta during pregnancy and as with a number of other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\\nThere is no scientific evidence to support Lyme disease transmission via blood transfusion, sexual contact, or breast milk. [ 90 ]\\nTick-borne co-infections [ edit ]\\nMain article: Tick-borne disease\\nTicks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other microbes, such as Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. [ 91 ] Among people with early Lyme disease, depending on their location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–10% will have babesiosis. [ 55 ] Ticks in certain regions also transmit viruses that cause tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan virus disease . [ 92 ] [ 55 ] Co-infections of Lyme disease may not require additional treatment, since they may resolve on their own or—as in the case of HGA—can be treated with the doxycycline prescribed for Lyme. [ 35 ] Persistent fever or compatible anomalous laboratory findings may be indicative of a co-infection. [ 55 ]\\nPathophysiology [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. [ 72 ] [ 93 ] B. Burgdorferi does not produce toxins. [ 94 ] Therefore, many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to spirochete in those tissues. [ 95 ]\\nB. burgdorferi is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. [ 96 ] Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. [ 97 ] This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis . The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. [ 72 ] Neutrophils , however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body. [ 98 ]\\nDays to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete. [ 99 ]\\nIf untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. [ 100 ] The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement , and hiding in the extracellular matrix , which may interfere with the function of immune factors. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]\\nImmunological studies [ edit ]\\nExposure to the Borrelia bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging inflammatory response , [ 103 ] a form of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease. [ 104 ] The production of this reaction might be due to a form of molecular mimicry , where Borrelia avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]\\nChronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever , but its wider application is controversial. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash, facial palsy , or arthritis ), history of possible exposure to infected ticks , and possibly laboratory tests . [ 4 ] [ 28 ] People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1–2 months. [ 35 ] Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common , within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull's eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms. [ 4 ] [ 111 ] In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota , but it is expanding into other areas. [ 70 ] Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk. [ 112 ]\\nIn the absence of an EM rash or history of tick exposure, Lyme diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation. [ 65 ] [ 113 ] The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time-consuming to grow in the laboratory. [ 4 ] [ 65 ] The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. [ 114 ] A positive antibody test result does not by itself prove active infection but can confirm an infection that is suspected because of symptoms, objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. [ 65 ] Because as many as 5–20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be tested for Lyme antibodies: a positive result would likely be false, possibly causing unnecessary treatment. [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available. [ 44 ] [ 115 ]\\nLaboratory testing [ edit ]\\nTests for antibodies in the blood by ELISA and Western blot is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. [ 116 ] The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2–4 weeks and 4–6 weeks, and peak at 6–8 weeks. [ 117 ] When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. [ 35 ] Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. [ 117 ] A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false-positive result. [ 118 ] The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4–6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years. [ 117 ]\\nOther tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii and almost always involves lymphocytic pleocytosis , i.e. the densities of lymphocytes (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Demonstration by lumbar puncture and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans , which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). [ 40 ] In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative. [ 119 ] American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat. [ 43 ] In infection involving the PNS, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment. [ 41 ]\\nIn Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography may show myocardial dysfunction. [ 46 ] Biopsy and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure. [ 46 ]\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material ( DNA ) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia . PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. [ 121 ] [ 40 ] Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during infection. [ 122 ] [ 40 ] Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid. [ 123 ] Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people. [ 40 ]\\nSeveral other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. OspA antigens , shed by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. [ 124 ] The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years. [ 127 ]\\nThe CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of B. burgdorferi , and lymphocyte transformation tests. [ 122 ]\\nImaging [ edit ]\\nNeuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis , but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. [ 128 ] Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vasculitis and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease , which makes them questionable. [ 129 ]\\nDifferential diagnosis [ edit ]\\nCommunity clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23–28% of erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. [ 113 ] EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites , cellulitis , or shingles . [ 113 ] Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull's eye. [ 4 ] Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2–3 cm/day and a diameter of at least 5 cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. [ 28 ] [ 32 ] Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee. [ 28 ] Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve's dermatome , and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. [ 130 ]\\nFacial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy . [ 44 ] Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. [ 44 ] Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. [ 44 ] Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. [ 44 ] Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. [ 44 ]\\nUnlike viral meningitis , Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy , or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF . [ 35 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the limbs is often misdiagnosed as a radiculopathy caused by nerve root compression, such as sciatica . [ 113 ] [ 131 ] Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4–6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating risks of other possible causes that, although less frequent, require immediate diagnosis and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. [ 132 ] A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms of lymphocytic meningitis, or facial palsy would lead to suspicion of Lyme disease and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation. [ 132 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and acute coronary syndrome . [ 45 ] [ 113 ] Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new \\\"great imitator\\\". [ 133 ] As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms. [ 134 ]\\nPrevention [ edit ]\\nTick bites may be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. [ 135 ] [ 9 ]\\nMost Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. [ 28 ] [ 135 ] Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands , shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. [ 28 ] [ 136 ] Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\\\"quest\\\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. [ 138 ] In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. [ 137 ] Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. [ 137 ] [ 135 ] In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. [ 137 ] Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. [ 137 ] [ 139 ] Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. [ 136 ]\\nAs a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. [ 135 ] [ 140 ] Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. [ 141 ] After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). [ 141 ] Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. [ 139 ] Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. [ 139 ] Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. [ 142 ] Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. [ 140 ] Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. [ 140 ] [ 143 ]\\nThe EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET , picaridin , IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD) . [ 135 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. [ 140 ] The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. [ 145 ] Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. [ 145 ] Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. [ 140 ] [ 144 ] Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). [ 140 ] [ 135 ] If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. [ 140 ] Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. [ 140 ]\\nAfter coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. [ 135 ] Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or warm dryer are not enough). [ 135 ] Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduce risk of infection. [ 135 ] Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister . [ 146 ] The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair. [ 135 ]\\nTick removal [ edit ]\\nRemoval of a tick using tweezers\\nAttached ticks should be removed promptly. Risk of infection increases with time of attachment, but in North America risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. [ 147 ] CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from the skin without twisting, jerking, squeezing or crushing the tick. [ 148 ] After tick removal, any tick parts remaining in the skin should be removed with a clean tweezer, if possible. [ 148 ] The wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. [ 148 ] The tick may be disposed by placing it in a container with alcohol, sealed bag, tape or flushed down the toilet. [ 148 ] The bitten person should write down where and when the bite happened so that this can be informed to a doctor if the person gets a rash or flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. [ 148 ] CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it. [ 148 ]\\nIn Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. [ 149 ] Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. [ 149 ] Another method consists in using about 20 cm of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]\\nPreventive antibiotics [ edit ]\\nThe risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. [ 28 ] It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. [ 28 ] If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70–80% of people infected). [ 4 ] [ 28 ]\\nGarden landscaping [ edit ]\\nSeveral landscaping practices may reduce the risk of tick bites in residential yards. [ 146 ] [ 152 ] These include keeping lawns mown, removing leaf litter and weeds and avoiding the use of ground cover. [ 146 ] A 3-ft-wide rock or woodchip barrier is recommended to separate lawns from wood piles, woodlands , stone walls and shrubs. [ 152 ] Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it to kill ticks. [ 152 ] A sun-exposed tick-safe zone at least 9 ft from the barrier should concentrate human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. [ 152 ] Materials such as wood decking, concrete, bricks, gravel or woodchips used on the ground under patios and playgrounds would discourage ticks there. [ 146 ] An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone. [ 152 ] [ 146 ]\\nOccupational exposure [ edit ]\\nOutdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active. [ 155 ]\\nHost animals [ edit ]\\nTicks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards , birds , mice , cats , dogs , deer , cattle and humans . The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \\\"dilution hosts\\\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and so decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. White-tailed deer are both a food source and a \\\"reproductive host\\\", where ticks tend to mate. [ 156 ] The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. Availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted. [ 157 ]\\nIn the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine , [ 158 ] and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. [ 159 ] Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. [ 160 ] While these studies have found these effects, other studies have found opposite effects. A study done in Massachusetts removed deer and did not see a significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. [ 161 ] Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to effectively control tick populations. [ 162 ] One study summarized the results of multiple studies all looking at deer reduction controlling tick populations and determined that deer control can't be used as a standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that since most of the studies looking at this are not good representatives of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. [ 163 ] There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen, would decrease Lyme disease risk the most. [ 164 ]\\nOthers have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not Borrelia burgdorferi reservoirs. This is because it was found that white-tailed deer blood actually kills the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. [ 165 ] Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks , may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission. [ 157 ]\\nTick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. [ 166 ] They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals through the use of acaricides has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on a number of grounds. Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment. [ 167 ]\\nIn Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). [ 168 ] These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. [ 168 ] \\\"The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus ; [ 169 ] \\\" it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi \\\" thought Jaenson & al. (1992) [ 170 ] (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, [ 171 ] as red deer and wild boars ( Sus scrofa ), [ 169 ] in which one Rickettsia and three Borrelia species were identified\\\", [ 169 ] with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. [ 172 ] Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe \\\" two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified \\\". [ 169 ]\\nVaccination [ edit ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] no human vaccines for Lyme disease were available. [ 27 ] The only human vaccine to advance to market was LYMErix, which was available from 1998, but discontinued in 2002. [ 173 ] The vaccine candidate VLA15 was scheduled to start a phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2022, with other research ongoing. Multiple vaccines are available for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nLYMErix [ edit ]\\nThe vaccine LYMErix was available from 1998 to 2002. The recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, was developed by SmithKline Beecham . In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine was found to confer protective immunity to Lyme disease in 76% of adults after three doses with only mild or moderate and transient adverse effects . [ 174 ] [ 175 ] On 21 December 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix on the basis of these trials for persons of ages 15 through 70. [ 175 ] [ 173 ]\\nFollowing approval of the vaccine , its entry into clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. [ 176 ] Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline , alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints. [ 177 ]\\nDespite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, [ 178 ] in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. [ 177 ] [ 179 ] The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a \\\"cautionary tale\\\"; [ 179 ] an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which \\\"unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.\\\" [ 180 ] The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told Nature : \\\"This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.\\\" [ 177 ] [ 181 ]\\nVLA15 [ edit ]\\nThe hexavalent (OspA) protein subunit-based vaccine candidate VLA15 was developed by Valneva . It was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017. [ 182 ] [ 183 ] In April 2020 Pfizer paid $130 million for the rights to the vaccine, and the companies are developing it together, performing multiple phase 2 trials. [ 184 ]\\nA phase 3 trial of VLA15 was scheduled for late 2022, recruiting volunteers at test sites located across the northeastern United States and in Europe. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Participants were scheduled to receive an initial three-dose series of vaccines over the course of five to nine months, followed by a booster dose after twelve months, with both the initial series and the booster dose scheduled to be complete before the year's peak Lyme disease season. [ 186 ]\\nOther research [ edit ]\\nAn mRNA vaccine designed to cause a strong fast immune response to tick saliva allowed the immune system to detect and remove the ticks from test animals before they were able to transmit the infectious bacteria. [ 187 ] The vaccine contains mRNAs for the body to build 19 proteins in tick saliva which, by enabling quick development of erythema (itchy redness) at the bite site, protects guinea pigs against Lyme disease. It also protected the test animals if the tick is not removed if only one tick, but not three, remain attached. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\\nCanine vaccines [ edit ]\\nCanine vaccines have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet- Schering-Plough 's vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA . The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial , generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog. [ 190 ]\\nTreatment [ edit ]\\nAntibiotics are the primary treatment. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. [ 28 ] For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. [ 28 ] People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns . [ 35 ] Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; [ 28 ] alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , and azithromycin . [ 28 ] Azithromycin is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. [ 35 ] The standard treatment for cellulitis , cephalexin , is not useful for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , as these are effective against both infections. [ 35 ] Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy , radiculopathy , meningitis , or peripheral neuropathy . [ 28 ] Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; [ 28 ] cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives. [ 28 ]\\nTreatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7–14 days in early localized disease, to 14–21 days in early disseminated disease to 14–28 days in late disseminated disease. [ 55 ] Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. [ 120 ] In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone . [ 120 ] Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. [ 28 ] [ 35 ] Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no evidence shows it to be effective. [ 28 ] [ 191 ] IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. [ 28 ] As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. [ 28 ]\\nFacial palsy may resolve without treatment: however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. [ 35 ] Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. [ 44 ] In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. [ 44 ] [ 192 ]\\nAbout a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids. [ 46 ]\\nPeople with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping should use crutches. [ 193 ] Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [ 35 ] Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. [ 35 ] [ 193 ] People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for Borrelia DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. [ 35 ] [ 55 ] [ 193 ] Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy , or physical therapy. [ 55 ] [ 193 ]\\nPeople receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it . [ 115 ]\\nPrognosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease's typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. [ 4 ] However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues. [ 35 ]\\nPeople who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. [ 113 ] Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64–71% at end of treatment for EM rash to about 84–90% after 30 months; higher percentages are reported in Europe. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Treatment failure, i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. [ 194 ] Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g. joint or muscle pains or fatigue . [ 196 ] These symptoms are usually mild and nondisabling. [ 196 ]\\nPeople treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits, in addition to subjective symptoms. [ 35 ] In Europe, an average of 32–33 months after initial Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14–21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with only an EM rash (16%). [ 197 ] In another European study, 5 years after treatment for neuroborreliosis lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter were less common among those treated within 30 days of the first symptom (16%) than among those treated later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated. [ 198 ]\\nSome data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] However, in Europe 41% of people treated for facial palsy had other lingering symptoms at followup up to 6 months later, including 28% with numbness or altered sensation and 14% with fatigue or concentration problems. [ 200 ] Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. [ 199 ] [ 201 ] Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another one is voluntarily moved) can become evident only 6–12 months after facial palsy appears to be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. [ 202 ] Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. [ 202 ] In longer-term follow-up, 16–23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover. [ 202 ]\\nIn Europe, about a quarter of people with Bannwarth syndrome (Lyme radiculopathy and lymphocytic meningitis ) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3–6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection in cerebrospinal fluid ; after 12 months, 64% recovered fully, 31% had nondisabling mild or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or required substantial use of analgesics. [ 43 ] The most common lingering nondisabling symptoms were headache, fatigue , altered sensation , joint pains , memory disturbances, malaise , radicular pain , sleep disturbances, muscle pains , and concentration disturbances. Lingering disabling symptoms included facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ]\\nRecovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage. [ 35 ]\\nAbout half the people with Lyme carditis progress to complete heart block , but it usually resolves in a week. [ 46 ] Other Lyme heart conduction abnormalities resolve typically within 6 weeks. [ 46 ] About 94% of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). [ 46 ] Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. [ 46 ] However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal. [ 46 ]\\nRecommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several months for inflammation to resolve and a second round of antibiotics is often necessary. [ 35 ] Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9–14 months (range 4 months – 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery. [ 193 ]\\nReinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6–11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. [ 194 ] The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain. [ 203 ]\\nPost-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [ edit ]\\nChronic symptoms like pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment are experienced by 5–20% of people who contract Lyme disease, even after completing treatment. This is called Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. [ 24 ] [ 204 ]\\nThe cause is unknown. One hypothesis is that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains. However, human and animal trials have not provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. [ 205 ] Another hypothesis is that autoimmunity has been triggered by the infection. Auto–immune responses are known to occur following other infections, including Campylobacter ( Guillain-Barré syndrome ), Chlamydia (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease). A third hypothesis is that debris from \\na previous infection could remain. [ 205 ]\\nAnother hypothesis is that symptoms are simply unrelated to a Lyme infection. [ 206 ] [ 207 ] In studies of people who presented to clinics with concerns about Lyme disease, 47 to 80% had no evidence of Lyme infection while 15 to 55% (median 34%) were able to obtain other diagnoses. [ 205 ]\\nThere is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective in early Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotics are not. They have been shown ineffective in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and is similar to the management of fibromyalgia or ME/CFS . PTLDS usually gets better over time, but recovery may take many months. [ 206 ]\\nEpidemiology and prevalence [ edit ]\\nCountries with reported Lyme disease cases\\nOverview [ edit ]\\nLyme disease occurs regularly in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. [ 208 ]\\nLyme disease effects are comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds.\\n An estimated 476,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated for the disease in the United States. This number is probably an overestimate due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated in Europe. [ 8 ] [ 4 ] [ 209 ]\\nThere is a suggestion that tick populations and Lyme disease occurrence are increasing and spreading into new areas, owing in part to the warming temperatures of climate change . [ 210 ] However, tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. [ 157 ] [ 211 ]\\nNorth America [ edit ]\\nMany studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of I. scapularis projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S. [ 212 ] A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. [ 213 ] The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology . [ 213 ]\\nUnited States [ edit ]\\nCDC map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the Northeast Megalopolis and western Wisconsin\\nLyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ]\\nAlthough Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). [ 90 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria has been modified multiple times. [ 219 ] The 2022 surveillance case definition classifies cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect. [ 220 ] The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.\\n The CDC emphasizes that, while surveillance data has limitations, it is useful due to \\\"uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness.\\\" While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted. [ 221 ] [ 90 ]\\nSeveral similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), also known as Masters disease. Amblyomma americanum , known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment. [ 222 ]\\nIn recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever. [ 218 ]\\nCanada [ edit ]\\nThe range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. [ 112 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] A model-based prediction by Leighton et al. (2012) suggests that the range of the I. scapularis tick will expand into Canada by 46 km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread. [ 226 ]\\nEurope [ edit ]\\nIn Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete B. burgdorferi sensu lato , mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus . [ 227 ] Cases of B. burgdorferi sensu lato -infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. [ 228 ] The number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. [ 229 ] Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising. [ 230 ] Lyme disease is rare in Iceland. On average around 6 to 7 cases are diagnosed every year, primarily localised infections presenting as erythema migrans. None of the cases had a definitive Icelandic origin and the yearly number of cases has not been increasing. [ 231 ]\\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\\nIn the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986 [ 232 ] when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Ireland combined. [ 233 ] In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, [ 234 ] but 973 in 2009 [ 232 ] and 953 in 2010. [ 235 ] Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010. [ 236 ]\\nIt is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year [ 235 ] (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas [ 232 ] ), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 \\\"to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor.\\\" [ 237 ] [ 238 ]\\nDespite Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi infection) being a notifiable disease in Scotland [ 239 ] since January 1990 [ 240 ] which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. [ 241 ] Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. [ 232 ]\\nAlthough there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest , Salisbury Plain , Exmoor , the South Downs , parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire , Thetford Forest [ 242 ] and the West coast and islands of Scotland, [ 243 ] infected ticks are widespread and can even be found in the parks of London. [ 234 ] [ 244 ] A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive , as were between 2% and 4–5% of the general local population of the area. [ 245 ] [ 246 ]\\nTests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] It is speculated that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. [ 249 ] However no published research has proven this to be so.\\nSouth America [ edit ]\\nIn Brazil, Lyme disease is not considered endemic. [ 250 ] A Lyme-like disease known as Baggio–Yoshinari syndrome has been described, attributed to microorganisms that do not belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted by ticks of the Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera. [ 251 ] The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia , São Paulo. [ 252 ] A 2024 analysis concluded that evidence to connect BYS to Borrelia bacteria was lacking. [ 250 ]\\nMexico [ edit ]\\nA 2007 study suggests Borrelia burgdorferi infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000. [ 253 ]\\nAfrica [ edit ]\\nIn northern Africa, B. burgdorferi sensu lato has been identified in Morocco , Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia . [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ]\\nLyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this region. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of Lyme infection in Africa. [ 257 ] In East Africa, two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya . [ 258 ] According The Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa, Lyme disease is not known to be endemic in either South Africa or Mozambique. [ 259 ]\\nAsia [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato -infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China, Nepal , Thailand and far eastern Russia. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Borrelia has also been isolated in Mongolia . [ 262 ]\\nAustraliasia [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is not considered endemic to Australia. [ 263 ] While there have been reports of people acquiring Lyme disease in Australia, and even evidence of closely related Borrelia species in ticks, [ 264 ] the evidence linking these cases to local transmission is limited. Ongoing research on resolving potential Borrelia species to Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT) in Australia are ongoing. [ 265 ]\\nEtymology [ edit ]\\nLyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . [ 266 ]\\nHistory [ edit ]\\nEarly evidence [ edit ]\\nThe earliest known evidence of Lyme disease was found in Oetzi , a 5300 year old mummy in the Eastern Alps near the Italian border. [ 267 ] \\nThe evolutionary history of Borrelia burgdorferi genetics has been examined by scientists. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the Midwest that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. [ 268 ]\\nJohn Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663 to 1670, wrote \\\"there be infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\\\" [ 269 ]\\nThis is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm , a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus , and who found the forests of New York \\\"abound\\\" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. [ 270 ]\\nPerhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. [ 271 ] He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \\\"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\\\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \\\"worm\\\" with a body which is \\\"of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\\\" that \\\"penetrates the skin\\\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. [ 272 ]\\nThe examination of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. [ 270 ] The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman , a 5,300-year-old mummy , revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. [ 273 ]\\nThe early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau , Germany (now Wrocław , Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who for 16 years had had a degenerative skin disorder now known as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans . [ 274 ]\\nAt a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion erythema migrans . [ 274 ] The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911. [ 275 ]\\nModern history [ edit ]\\nThe modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult. [ 276 ]\\nNeurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. [ 277 ] In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.\\n Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. [ 278 ] Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. [ citation needed ] Starting in 1946, facilities in Sweden experimented with treating EM rashes with substances known to kill spirochetes. [ 279 ] Einar Hollström  [ sv ] reported that \\\"penicillin was found to be the most effective.\\\" [ 280 ] In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. [ 281 ] In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe. [ 282 ] [ 283 ]\\nIn 1970 a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin. [ 284 ]\\nThe full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme , which gave the disease its popular name. [ 285 ] This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service , and by others from Yale University , including Stephen Malawista , who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. [ 286 ] The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that \\\"Lyme arthritis\\\" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe. [ 287 ]\\nBefore 1976, the elements of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius's disease, [ 288 ] Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, [ 289 ] [ 290 ] Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis. [ 291 ] [ 292 ]\\nIn 1980, Steere, et al. , began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. [ 293 ] In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer , a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory , with collections of I. dammini [ scapularis ] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed \\\"poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.\\\" Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the \\\"long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.\\\" Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour \\\"offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.\\\" Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. [ 294 ] In June 1982, he published his findings in Science , and the spirochete was named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor. [ 295 ]\\nAfter the identification of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics , amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone . [ 296 ] [ 297 ] The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands. [ 298 ]\\nSociety, culture, and controversy [ edit ]\\nLandscape changes and urbanization [ edit ]\\nUrbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents—the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector , the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. [ 301 ]\\nThe dilution effect [ edit ]\\nGiven these habitat-host dynamics, in 2003 some researchers began to postulate whether the so called dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease. [ 299 ] The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that an increase in host biodiversity will result in a decrease in the number of vectors infected with B. burgdorferi . [ 299 ] Scientific research has shown that nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) decreases as the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect. [ 299 ] That said, there is no direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven. [ 299 ] Additionally, as of 2018, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates [ 302 ]\\nChronic Lyme disease [ edit ]\\nMain article: Chronic Lyme disease\\nThe term \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, [ 303 ] and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] [ 304 ] Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with B. burgdorferi or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing non-specific symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease. [ 305 ]\\nThe 2008 documentary Under Our Skin is known for promoting controversial and unrecognized theories about \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\". [ 306 ]\\nConspiracy theories about origins [ edit ]\\nProlific but unfounded conspiracy theories have alleged that Lyme disease was a biological weapon that originated in the Plum Island laboratory , which is near Old Lyme, Connecticut. [ 307 ] A discredited 2004 book entitled Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory fueled the conspiracy theories. [ 308 ] [ 309 ] Archived specimens show that Lyme disease was endemic well before the establishment of Plum Island laboratory. [ 307 ] Additionally, Lyme disease was never a topic of research at Plum Island, according to the US Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture. [ 310 ] [ 308 ]\\nIn 2024 and 2025, conspiracy theories about the origins of Lyme disease were further spread due to attention from Robert F. Kennedy Jr . [ 311 ]\\nOther animals [ edit ]\\nDogs [ edit ]\\nPrevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step. [ 312 ]\\nAnother crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes ( Amitraz ), phenylpyrazoles ( Fipronil ), or permethrin ( pyrethroids ). [ 313 ] These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. [ 312 ] Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos. [ 313 ]\\nExamination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears. [ 314 ]\\nIn dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, [ 315 ] which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. [ 190 ] Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. [ 316 ] [ verification needed ] In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs. [ 317 ]\\nCats [ edit ]\\nUnlike dogs, it is very rare for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with B. burgdorferi , following a bite from an infected tick. Cats who are infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including but not limited to lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. [ 318 ] In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans. [ 319 ] However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be asymptomatic , and show no noticeable signs of the disease. [ 319 ] [ 318 ] Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required. [ 318 ]\\nHorses [ edit ]\\nLyme disease in horses is often challenging to diagnose because symptoms vary widely. Common acute symptoms include weight loss, fever, lameness , ataxia , and other muscle and joint-related issues. [ 320 ] [ 321 ] [ 322 ] Additional symptoms include muscle tenderness, swollen joints, arthritis , and neck stiffness. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] Chronic symptoms of the disease typically include neurological manifestations, such as meningitis , cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis , and encephalitis . [ 326 ] [ 320 ] [ 327 ] [ 328 ] Furthermore, it is important to note that some horses do not slow clinical signs of Lyme disease. [ 329 ]\\nThere are three main testing strategies used to diagnose horses with Lyme disease. They include clinical evaluation, serological testing , and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. [ 330 ] [ 331 ] [ 321 ] Detection of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine Lyme disease and unspecific testing for antibodies is not recommended. [ 332 ]\\nTypical treatment involves antibiotics such as oxytetracycline , doxycycline , ceftriaxone , or minocycline . [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 329 ] In some cases, a combination of antibiotics may be administered. Doxycycline and minocycline are taken orally, while oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are usually administered intravenously. [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 329 ] The duration and dosage of treatment vary widely among cases. In most cases, the infected horse is euthanized . [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 327 ] [ 336 ] Death of horses as a result of Borrelia burgdorferi infection remains unknown. [ 337 ]\\nCurrently, there is no approved Lyme disease vaccine for horses available. [ 338 ] However, a study demonstrated that ponies could be protected using an aluminum adjuvanted recombinant outer-surface protein A (rOspA) vaccine. [ 339 ] While horses have been administered a Lyme disease vaccine designed for dogs, it elicits only a short-lasting antibody response. [ 338 ] Another study supports the use of commercial Lyme disease vaccines, showing that they do elicit an antibody response, which can be significantly enhanced when horses receive an additional booster vaccine.

Compared to non-immunized guinea pigs, vaccinated animals exposed to infected ticks quickly developed redness at the tick bite site. None of the immunized animals developed Lyme disease if ticks were removed when redness developed. In contrast, about half of the control group became infected with B. burgdorferi after tick removal. When a single infected tick was attached to immunized guinea pigs and not removed, none of vaccinated animals were infected compared to 60 percent of control animals. However, protection waned in immunized guinea pigs if three ticks remained attached to the animal. Ticks in immunized animals were unable to feed aggressively and dislodged more quickly than those on guinea pigs in the control group.\\n^ Sajid A, Matias J, Arora G, Kurokawa C, DePonte K, Tang X, et al.

What is Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi , which you can get if an infected deer tick (also called black-legged tick) bites you. Ordinary \\\"wood ticks\\\" and \\\"dog ticks\\\" don’t carry the infection. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy The first recognition of Lyme disease, also called borreliosis, began in 1975 when many children received a diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Lyme, Connecticut, and two neighboring towns. Researchers found that bites from infected deer ticks were responsible for the outbreak of arthritis. What are the stages (phases) of Lyme disease? Lyme disease may evolve through phases (stages), which can overlap and cause symptoms that may involve the skin, joints, heart or nervous system. These stages are: Early localized Lyme disease (weeks one through four). Early disseminated Lyme disease (months one through four). Late persistent, late disseminated or just late Lyme disease (after four months, even up to years later). How common is Lyme disease? In the United States, about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year. But there are other, diagnosed cases that aren't reported. Signs and Symptoms What are the symptoms of Lyme disease? Signs and symptoms of early Lyme disease typically include: A reddish ras h or skin lesion known as erythema migraines (EM). The rash starts as a small red spot at the site of the tick bite anywhere from one week after to four weeks after the bite. The spot expands over a period of days or weeks, forming a circular, triangular or oval-shaped rash. The rash may look like a bull’s eye because it appears as a red ring that surrounds a clear center area. The rash can range in size from that of a dime to the entire width of a person's back. As infection spreads, several EM rashes (lesions) can appear at different sites on your body. Fever . Headache . Stiff neck. Body and joint aches. Fatigue . Swollen lymph nodes (swollen glands). Advertisement Signs and symptoms of the second stage of Lyme disease (the early disseminated stage) may include: Multiple areas of rash. Paralysis of facial muscles ( Bell's palsy ). Heart block or an interruption of the electrical system of the heart. Areas of numbness or abnormal feelings ( neuropathy ). Signs and symptoms of untreated late Lyme disease, which may happen from months to a year after infection, may include: Recurring episodes of swollen joints ( arthritis ). This typically affects large joints like the knee. Difficulty concentrating, known as “brain fog.” This is a form of encephalopathy or damage to the brain. Damage to nerves all over your body, including your skin, muscles and organs (polyneuropathy). Diagnosis and Tests How is Lyme disease diagnosed? A healthcare provider will diagnose Lyme disease based on symptoms, physical findings (like a rash) and whether or not you've been in an area populated by infected ticks. Many people don’t remember or know that they’ve been bitten by a tick. This is because the tick is tiny, and its bite is usually painless. Your provider will confirm the diagnosis using a blood test. If your first blood test is negative for Lyme disease, you won't need another test. If the first test is positive or equivocal, your provider will conduct the test again. You have to have two positive (or sometimes equivocal) results to be diagnosed with Lyme disease. Management and Treatment How is Lyme disease treated? Antibiotics , usually doxycycline or amoxicillin, are effective treatments for Lyme disease. How long your treatment lasts depends on the stage of infection. In general, it’s true that the sooner you’re treated, the quicker and more complete the recovery. Pregnant women should receive treatment for Lyme disease as well. There is, however, no evidence that a fetus can get the infection from its birth mother. There’s also no strong evidence that miscarriages are more likely after Lyme disease. What should I do if a tick bites me? If a tick bites you, the best way to remove it is by taking the following steps: Tug gently but firmly with blunt tweezers near the \\\"head\\\" of the tick at the level of your skin until it releases its hold on your skin. Avoid crushing the tick's body or handling the tick with bare fingers because you could expose yourself to the bacteria in the tick. Wash the bite area thoroughly with soap and water. Don't use kerosene, petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline®) or hot cigarette butts to remove the tick. Don't squeeze the tick's body with your fingers or tweezers. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can Lyme disease be prevented? Most people with Lyme disease get the infection during the late spring, summer and early fall when immature ticks are out feeding. In warm climates, few tick bites take place during winter months. Advertisement Deer ticks are most often found in wooded areas and nearby grasslands. They’re especially common where the two areas merge, including neighborhood yards where deer occasionally roam. Ticks don’t survive long on sunny lawns. They dry out quickly and die. Although only about 1% of all deer ticks carry Lyme disease-causing bacteria, there are areas in which over 50% of the ticks carry the bacterium. The diseased ticks are often found in the U.S. Northeast and upper Midwest areas. Ticks also live in coastal areas. Black-legged ticks can get the infection from animals other than deer. Mice, voles and some squirrels can carry the bacteria. How can I prevent tick bites? The following tips can help you avoid tick bites: To repel ticks, you may want to spray your clothing with permethrin, an insecticide commonly found in lawn and garden stores. Insect repellents that contain a chemical called DEET can also be applied to clothing or directly onto your skin. Read the labels carefully. Don’t overuse it. Too much may be harmful. Minimize skin exposure to both ticks and insect repellents by wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts that fit tightly at the ankles and wrists. Wear a hat, tuck your pant legs into socks and wear shoes that leave no part of your feet exposed. Wear light-colored clothing to make it easier to detect ticks. Walk in the center of trails to avoid picking up ticks from overhanging grass and brush. After outdoor activities in an \\\"at risk\\\" area, always do a tick check and then shower, scrubbing with a washcloth. Get rid of any ticks on your clothes by putting them in the dryer for 15 minutes. This will kill any ticks attached to the clothes by drying them out. Pets may bring ticks into your home. Discuss ways to prevent ticks on your pet with your veterinarian. Advertisement Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for someone with Lyme disease? Most of the people who get Lyme disease and receive treatment early will be fine. Treatment can cure Lyme disease but you might still have some long-term effects. Untreated Lyme disease may contribute to other serious problems but it’s rarely fatal. Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome Even after proper treatment, some people (estimated at 5% to 15%) may experience lingering fatigue, achiness or headaches. This is known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome or PTLDS. The symptoms don’t mean that you still have an infection. PTLDS probably won’t respond to additional antibiotics. The majority of people in this group will have symptoms that resolve at some point over the next six months. Chronic Lyme disease Chronic Lyme disease is a term used by some for a condition in a person who had Lyme disease and the symptoms of PTLDS. Some people consider chronic Lyme disease to be the same as PTLDS. However, some people receive a chronic Lyme disease diagnosis without a Lyme disease diagnosis. Sometimes, extended treatment with antibiotics helps. This term may be why some people think a Lyme disease infection can occur without being bitten by a tick. There isn't enough proof that mosquitoes can transmit Lyme disease. Many researchers dislike using the term “chronic Lyme disease.” Advertisement Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? If you feel sick after having spent time in areas where ticks might live, you should make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If you received a Lyme disease diagnosis and you don’t feel well after taking all of your antibiotics, contact your provider. This is especially true if you have symptoms like a stiff neck or mental confusion. Additional Common Questions Can Lyme disease completely be cured? Taking oral antibiotics typically cures Lyme disease after two to four weeks. You may need to get antibiotics through the vein (intravenously) for four more weeks. However, there’s no reason to think that Lyme disease stays in you forever after treatment. A note from Cleveland Clinic If you’re going to spend time in an area that might have ticks, take measures to avoid being bitten. This includes wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants to make it harder for ticks to bite. If you feel sick after being in an area that probably has ticks, make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If your provider prescribes antibiotics, make sure you take all of them as instructed. Care at Cleveland Clinic Cleveland Clinic’s primary care providers offer lifelong medical care.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash , known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. [ 1 ] The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. [ 1 ] Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. [ 1 ] Early diagnosis can be difficult. [ 11 ] Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness . [ 1 ] If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face , joint pains , severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations . [ 1 ] Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. [ 1 ] Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. [ 1 ]\\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes . [ 12 ] In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , \\\"In most cases, a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.\\\" [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In North America, the bacterial species Borrelia burgdorferi and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease. [ 4 ] [ 16 ] In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii , Borrelia garinii , B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. [ 4 ] The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals nor through food. [ 13 ] Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. [ 5 ] [ 17 ] Blood tests are often falsely negative in the early stages of the disease. [ 4 ] Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. [ 18 ]\\nPrevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin -based insect repellents . [ 4 ] [ 9 ] Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. [ 4 ] Ticks can be removed using tweezers . [ 19 ] If the removed tick is full of blood a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent the development of infection but is not generally recommended since the development of infection is rare. [ 4 ] If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime . [ 4 ] Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. [ 4 ] Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment, which may last for one or two days. [ 4 ] In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. [ 4 ] [ 20 ]\\nLyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. [ 21 ] [ 8 ] Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. [ 4 ] Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . [ 22 ] The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer . [ 23 ] People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). [ 24 ] PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease , a term no longer supported by scientists and used in different ways by different groups. [ 20 ] [ 25 ] Some healthcare providers claim that chronic Lyme is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment. [ 26 ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] , clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced, but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. [ 27 ] There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nSigns and symptoms [ edit ]\\nLyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms.\\n20% of Lyme rashes in the United States show a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" appearance. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]\\nErythema migrans (\\\"migrating redness\\\") on a woman's neck. [ 31 ] Rashes from non-Lyme causes may look similar. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]\\nThe incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). [ 34 ] Lyme symptoms most often occur from the month of May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases. [ 34 ]\\nEarly localized infection [ edit ]\\n80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit , groin , back of the knee , or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (median is 16 cm). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] [ 32 ]\\nThe rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. [ 4 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM) which translates as \\\"migrating redness.\\\" In about 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges possibly forming a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" pattern, but this clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. [ 32 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. [ 4 ]\\nThe Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms. [ 4 ]\\nPeople with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis . [ 35 ]\\nNot everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms, and many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases. [ 36 ]\\nAsymptomatic infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States. [ 37 ] Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe. [ 38 ]\\nEarly disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nWithin days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the Borrelia bacteria may spread through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10–20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. [ 28 ] Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common. [ 28 ]\\nIn about 10–15% of untreated people, Lyme causes neurological problems known as neuroborreliosis . [ 39 ] Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4–6 weeks (range 1–12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy, and/or mononeuritis multiplex. [ 35 ] [ 40 ] Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. [ 41 ] After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms . Up to 76.5% of them present as tinnitus , the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness (53.7%) and hearing loss (16.7%) were the next most common symptoms. [ 42 ] In children, partial loss of vision may also occur. [ 35 ] Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves . When due to Lyme, it most typically causes facial palsy , impairing blinking, smiling, and chewing on one or both sides of the face. It may also cause intermittent double vision . [ 35 ] [ 41 ] Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness , numbness , or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots , e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. [ 39 ] [ 35 ] Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord , with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech , impaired movement , impaired motor planning , or shaking . [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn North America, facial palsy is the typical early neuroborreliosis presentation, occurring in 5–10% of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. [ 35 ] [ 44 ] Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. [ 45 ] In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome , accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ] In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. [ 38 ] In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%). [ 40 ]\\nIn about 4–10% of untreated cases in the United States and 0.3–4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days to 7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness , fainting , shortness of breath , and chest pain . [ 46 ] Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches , facial palsy , headaches , or radicular pain . [ 46 ] In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis in 19–87% of people adversely impacts the heart's electrical conduction system, causing atrioventricular block that often manifests as heart rhythms that alternate within minutes between abnormally slow and abnormally fast. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 10–15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly , left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure. [ 46 ]\\nAnother skin condition, found in Europe but not in North America, is borrelial lymphocytoma , a purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum . [ 48 ]\\nLate disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nLyme arthritis caused this 3-year-old girl's knee to become swollen. Though painless, it did make her limp. [ 49 ]\\nLyme arthritis occurs in up to 60% of untreated people, typically starting about six months after infection. [ 28 ] It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip , other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint . [ 35 ] [ 50 ] Usually, large joint effusion and swelling occur, but only mild or moderate pain. [ 35 ] Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time, but periodically return. [ 35 ] Baker's cysts may form and rupture.\\n In early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and over time possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis that discovered poor documentation of this manifestation, experts wondered if it exists at all in the US or is merely very rare. [ 35 ] [ 51 ]\\nA neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia , a general sense of feeling unwell , and changes in personality. [ 52 ] Lyme encephalopathy is controversial in the US and has not been reported in Europe. [ 8 ] Problems such as depression and fibromyalgia are as common in people with Lyme disease as in the general population. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] There is no compelling evidence that Lyme disease causes psychiatric disorders, behavioral disorders (e.g. ADHD ), or developmental disorders (e.g. autism ). [ 55 ]\\nAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly. [ 48 ] It begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. [ 56 ] It is also associated with peripheral neuropathy. [ 51 ]\\nCause [ edit ]\\nMain article: Lyme disease microbiology\\nFurther information: Weather and climate effects on Lyme disease exposure\\nBorrelia bacteria, the causative agents of Lyme disease, magnified\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochetes , gram-negative bacteria from the genus Borrelia . Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella . [ 57 ] The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato , and show a great deal of genetic diversity . [ 58 ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato is a species complex made up of 20 accepted and three proposed genospecies. Eight species are known to cause Lyme disease: B. mayonii (found in North America), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (found in North America and Europe), B. afzelii , B. garinii, B. spielmanii, and B. lusitaniae (all found in Eurasia ). [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 16 ] [ 10 ] Some studies have also proposed that B. valaisiana may sometimes infect humans, but this species does not seem to be an important cause of disease. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]\\nTick life cycle [ edit ]\\nDeer tick life cycle\\nIxodes scapularis , the primary vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America\\nThree stages occur in the life cycle of a tick - larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and are usually most active in late spring and early summer in regions where the climate is mild. During the adult stage, Lyme disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and tend to be larger in size, so can be easily seen and removed. [ 63 ]\\nTransmission [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is classified as a zoonosis , as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts . [ 64 ] Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia ). [ 65 ] Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage , because they are very small, thus may feed for long periods of time undetected. [ 64 ] Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. [ 66 ] Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. [ 67 ] The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected. [ 68 ] Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Borrelia from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse , and occasionally birds. [ 69 ] Areas where Lyme is common are expanding. [ 70 ]\\nWithin the tick midgut, the Borrelia ' s outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the Borrelia downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection. [ 71 ] Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC. [ 72 ]\\nTick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. [ 73 ]\\nWhile B. burgdorferi is most associated with ticks hosted by white-tailed deer and white-footed mice , Borrelia afzelii is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto . The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association. [ 74 ]\\nBudding research has suggested that B. burgdorferi sensu lato may also be able to form enzootic cycle among lizard populations; [ 75 ] this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations of lizards, such as California. Except for one study in Europe, [ 74 ] much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia , it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific. [ 79 ]\\nTick Ixodes ricinus , developmental stages\\nIn Europe, the main vector is Ixodes ricinus , which is also called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. [ 80 ] In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector. [ 81 ] In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) is the main vector on the East Coast. [ 68 ]\\nThe lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as Texas , is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes , [ 82 ] though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness , which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease. [ 83 ]\\nOn the West Coast of the United States , the main vector is the western black-legged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ). [ 84 ] The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the western fence lizard that are resistant to Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West. [ 85 ] [ 79 ]\\nTransmission can occur across the placenta during pregnancy and as with a number of other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\\nThere is no scientific evidence to support Lyme disease transmission via blood transfusion, sexual contact, or breast milk. [ 90 ]\\nTick-borne co-infections [ edit ]\\nMain article: Tick-borne disease\\nTicks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other microbes, such as Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. [ 91 ] Among people with early Lyme disease, depending on their location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–10% will have babesiosis. [ 55 ] Ticks in certain regions also transmit viruses that cause tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan virus disease . [ 92 ] [ 55 ] Co-infections of Lyme disease may not require additional treatment, since they may resolve on their own or—as in the case of HGA—can be treated with the doxycycline prescribed for Lyme. [ 35 ] Persistent fever or compatible anomalous laboratory findings may be indicative of a co-infection. [ 55 ]\\nPathophysiology [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. [ 72 ] [ 93 ] B. Burgdorferi does not produce toxins. [ 94 ] Therefore, many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to spirochete in those tissues. [ 95 ]\\nB. burgdorferi is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. [ 96 ] Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. [ 97 ] This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis . The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. [ 72 ] Neutrophils , however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body. [ 98 ]\\nDays to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete. [ 99 ]\\nIf untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. [ 100 ] The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement , and hiding in the extracellular matrix , which may interfere with the function of immune factors. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]\\nImmunological studies [ edit ]\\nExposure to the Borrelia bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging inflammatory response , [ 103 ] a form of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease. [ 104 ] The production of this reaction might be due to a form of molecular mimicry , where Borrelia avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]\\nChronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever , but its wider application is controversial. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash, facial palsy , or arthritis ), history of possible exposure to infected ticks , and possibly laboratory tests . [ 4 ] [ 28 ] People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1–2 months. [ 35 ] Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common , within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull's eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms. [ 4 ] [ 111 ] In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota , but it is expanding into other areas. [ 70 ] Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk. [ 112 ]\\nIn the absence of an EM rash or history of tick exposure, Lyme diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation. [ 65 ] [ 113 ] The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time-consuming to grow in the laboratory. [ 4 ] [ 65 ] The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. [ 114 ] A positive antibody test result does not by itself prove active infection but can confirm an infection that is suspected because of symptoms, objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. [ 65 ] Because as many as 5–20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be tested for Lyme antibodies: a positive result would likely be false, possibly causing unnecessary treatment. [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available. [ 44 ] [ 115 ]\\nLaboratory testing [ edit ]\\nTests for antibodies in the blood by ELISA and Western blot is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. [ 116 ] The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2–4 weeks and 4–6 weeks, and peak at 6–8 weeks. [ 117 ] When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. [ 35 ] Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. [ 117 ] A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false-positive result. [ 118 ] The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4–6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years. [ 117 ]\\nOther tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii and almost always involves lymphocytic pleocytosis , i.e. the densities of lymphocytes (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Demonstration by lumbar puncture and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans , which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). [ 40 ] In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative. [ 119 ] American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat. [ 43 ] In infection involving the PNS, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment. [ 41 ]\\nIn Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography may show myocardial dysfunction. [ 46 ] Biopsy and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure. [ 46 ]\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material ( DNA ) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia . PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. [ 121 ] [ 40 ] Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during infection. [ 122 ] [ 40 ] Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid. [ 123 ] Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people. [ 40 ]\\nSeveral other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. OspA antigens , shed by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. [ 124 ] The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years. [ 127 ]\\nThe CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of B. burgdorferi , and lymphocyte transformation tests. [ 122 ]\\nImaging [ edit ]\\nNeuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis , but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. [ 128 ] Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vasculitis and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease , which makes them questionable. [ 129 ]\\nDifferential diagnosis [ edit ]\\nCommunity clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23–28% of erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. [ 113 ] EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites , cellulitis , or shingles . [ 113 ] Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull's eye. [ 4 ] Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2–3 cm/day and a diameter of at least 5 cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. [ 28 ] [ 32 ] Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee. [ 28 ] Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve's dermatome , and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. [ 130 ]\\nFacial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy . [ 44 ] Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. [ 44 ] Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. [ 44 ] Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. [ 44 ] Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. [ 44 ]\\nUnlike viral meningitis , Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy , or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF . [ 35 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the limbs is often misdiagnosed as a radiculopathy caused by nerve root compression, such as sciatica . [ 113 ] [ 131 ] Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4–6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating risks of other possible causes that, although less frequent, require immediate diagnosis and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. [ 132 ] A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms of lymphocytic meningitis, or facial palsy would lead to suspicion of Lyme disease and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation. [ 132 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and acute coronary syndrome . [ 45 ] [ 113 ] Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new \\\"great imitator\\\". [ 133 ] As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms. [ 134 ]\\nPrevention [ edit ]\\nTick bites may be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. [ 135 ] [ 9 ]\\nMost Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. [ 28 ] [ 135 ] Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands , shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. [ 28 ] [ 136 ] Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\\\"quest\\\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. [ 138 ] In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. [ 137 ] Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. [ 137 ] [ 135 ] In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. [ 137 ] Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. [ 137 ] [ 139 ] Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. [ 136 ]\\nAs a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. [ 135 ] [ 140 ] Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. [ 141 ] After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). [ 141 ] Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. [ 139 ] Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. [ 139 ] Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. [ 142 ] Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. [ 140 ] Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. [ 140 ] [ 143 ]\\nThe EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET , picaridin , IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD) . [ 135 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. [ 140 ] The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. [ 145 ] Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. [ 145 ] Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. [ 140 ] [ 144 ] Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). [ 140 ] [ 135 ] If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. [ 140 ] Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. [ 140 ]\\nAfter coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. [ 135 ] Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or warm dryer are not enough). [ 135 ] Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduce risk of infection. [ 135 ] Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister . [ 146 ] The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair. [ 135 ]\\nTick removal [ edit ]\\nRemoval of a tick using tweezers\\nAttached ticks should be removed promptly. Risk of infection increases with time of attachment, but in North America risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. [ 147 ] CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from the skin without twisting, jerking, squeezing or crushing the tick. [ 148 ] After tick removal, any tick parts remaining in the skin should be removed with a clean tweezer, if possible. [ 148 ] The wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. [ 148 ] The tick may be disposed by placing it in a container with alcohol, sealed bag, tape or flushed down the toilet. [ 148 ] The bitten person should write down where and when the bite happened so that this can be informed to a doctor if the person gets a rash or flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. [ 148 ] CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it. [ 148 ]\\nIn Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. [ 149 ] Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. [ 149 ] Another method consists in using about 20 cm of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]\\nPreventive antibiotics [ edit ]\\nThe risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. [ 28 ] It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. [ 28 ] If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70–80% of people infected). [ 4 ] [ 28 ]\\nGarden landscaping [ edit ]\\nSeveral landscaping practices may reduce the risk of tick bites in residential yards. [ 146 ] [ 152 ] These include keeping lawns mown, removing leaf litter and weeds and avoiding the use of ground cover. [ 146 ] A 3-ft-wide rock or woodchip barrier is recommended to separate lawns from wood piles, woodlands , stone walls and shrubs. [ 152 ] Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it to kill ticks. [ 152 ] A sun-exposed tick-safe zone at least 9 ft from the barrier should concentrate human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. [ 152 ] Materials such as wood decking, concrete, bricks, gravel or woodchips used on the ground under patios and playgrounds would discourage ticks there. [ 146 ] An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone. [ 152 ] [ 146 ]\\nOccupational exposure [ edit ]\\nOutdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active. [ 155 ]\\nHost animals [ edit ]\\nTicks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards , birds , mice , cats , dogs , deer , cattle and humans . The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \\\"dilution hosts\\\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and so decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. White-tailed deer are both a food source and a \\\"reproductive host\\\", where ticks tend to mate. [ 156 ] The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. Availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted. [ 157 ]\\nIn the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine , [ 158 ] and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. [ 159 ] Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. [ 160 ] While these studies have found these effects, other studies have found opposite effects. A study done in Massachusetts removed deer and did not see a significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. [ 161 ] Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to effectively control tick populations. [ 162 ] One study summarized the results of multiple studies all looking at deer reduction controlling tick populations and determined that deer control can't be used as a standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that since most of the studies looking at this are not good representatives of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. [ 163 ] There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen, would decrease Lyme disease risk the most. [ 164 ]\\nOthers have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not Borrelia burgdorferi reservoirs. This is because it was found that white-tailed deer blood actually kills the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. [ 165 ] Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks , may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission. [ 157 ]\\nTick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. [ 166 ] They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals through the use of acaricides has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on a number of grounds. Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment. [ 167 ]\\nIn Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). [ 168 ] These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. [ 168 ] \\\"The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus ; [ 169 ] \\\" it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi \\\" thought Jaenson & al. (1992) [ 170 ] (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, [ 171 ] as red deer and wild boars ( Sus scrofa ), [ 169 ] in which one Rickettsia and three Borrelia species were identified\\\", [ 169 ] with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. [ 172 ] Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe \\\" two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified \\\". [ 169 ]\\nVaccination [ edit ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] no human vaccines for Lyme disease were available. [ 27 ] The only human vaccine to advance to market was LYMErix, which was available from 1998, but discontinued in 2002. [ 173 ] The vaccine candidate VLA15 was scheduled to start a phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2022, with other research ongoing. Multiple vaccines are available for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nLYMErix [ edit ]\\nThe vaccine LYMErix was available from 1998 to 2002. The recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, was developed by SmithKline Beecham . In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine was found to confer protective immunity to Lyme disease in 76% of adults after three doses with only mild or moderate and transient adverse effects . [ 174 ] [ 175 ] On 21 December 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix on the basis of these trials for persons of ages 15 through 70. [ 175 ] [ 173 ]\\nFollowing approval of the vaccine , its entry into clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. [ 176 ] Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline , alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints. [ 177 ]\\nDespite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, [ 178 ] in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. [ 177 ] [ 179 ] The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a \\\"cautionary tale\\\"; [ 179 ] an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which \\\"unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.\\\" [ 180 ] The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told Nature : \\\"This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.\\\" [ 177 ] [ 181 ]\\nVLA15 [ edit ]\\nThe hexavalent (OspA) protein subunit-based vaccine candidate VLA15 was developed by Valneva . It was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017. [ 182 ] [ 183 ] In April 2020 Pfizer paid $130 million for the rights to the vaccine, and the companies are developing it together, performing multiple phase 2 trials. [ 184 ]\\nA phase 3 trial of VLA15 was scheduled for late 2022, recruiting volunteers at test sites located across the northeastern United States and in Europe. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Participants were scheduled to receive an initial three-dose series of vaccines over the course of five to nine months, followed by a booster dose after twelve months, with both the initial series and the booster dose scheduled to be complete before the year's peak Lyme disease season. [ 186 ]\\nOther research [ edit ]\\nAn mRNA vaccine designed to cause a strong fast immune response to tick saliva allowed the immune system to detect and remove the ticks from test animals before they were able to transmit the infectious bacteria. [ 187 ] The vaccine contains mRNAs for the body to build 19 proteins in tick saliva which, by enabling quick development of erythema (itchy redness) at the bite site, protects guinea pigs against Lyme disease. It also protected the test animals if the tick is not removed if only one tick, but not three, remain attached. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\\nCanine vaccines [ edit ]\\nCanine vaccines have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet- Schering-Plough 's vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA . The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial , generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog. [ 190 ]\\nTreatment [ edit ]\\nAntibiotics are the primary treatment. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. [ 28 ] For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. [ 28 ] People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns . [ 35 ] Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; [ 28 ] alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , and azithromycin . [ 28 ] Azithromycin is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. [ 35 ] The standard treatment for cellulitis , cephalexin , is not useful for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , as these are effective against both infections. [ 35 ] Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy , radiculopathy , meningitis , or peripheral neuropathy . [ 28 ] Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; [ 28 ] cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives. [ 28 ]\\nTreatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7–14 days in early localized disease, to 14–21 days in early disseminated disease to 14–28 days in late disseminated disease. [ 55 ] Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. [ 120 ] In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone . [ 120 ] Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. [ 28 ] [ 35 ] Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no evidence shows it to be effective. [ 28 ] [ 191 ] IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. [ 28 ] As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. [ 28 ]\\nFacial palsy may resolve without treatment: however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. [ 35 ] Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. [ 44 ] In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. [ 44 ] [ 192 ]\\nAbout a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids. [ 46 ]\\nPeople with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping should use crutches. [ 193 ] Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [ 35 ] Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. [ 35 ] [ 193 ] People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for Borrelia DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. [ 35 ] [ 55 ] [ 193 ] Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy , or physical therapy. [ 55 ] [ 193 ]\\nPeople receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it . [ 115 ]\\nPrognosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease's typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. [ 4 ] However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues. [ 35 ]\\nPeople who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. [ 113 ] Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64–71% at end of treatment for EM rash to about 84–90% after 30 months; higher percentages are reported in Europe. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Treatment failure, i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. [ 194 ] Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g. joint or muscle pains or fatigue . [ 196 ] These symptoms are usually mild and nondisabling. [ 196 ]\\nPeople treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits, in addition to subjective symptoms. [ 35 ] In Europe, an average of 32–33 months after initial Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14–21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with only an EM rash (16%). [ 197 ] In another European study, 5 years after treatment for neuroborreliosis lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter were less common among those treated within 30 days of the first symptom (16%) than among those treated later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated. [ 198 ]\\nSome data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] However, in Europe 41% of people treated for facial palsy had other lingering symptoms at followup up to 6 months later, including 28% with numbness or altered sensation and 14% with fatigue or concentration problems. [ 200 ] Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. [ 199 ] [ 201 ] Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another one is voluntarily moved) can become evident only 6–12 months after facial palsy appears to be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. [ 202 ] Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. [ 202 ] In longer-term follow-up, 16–23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover. [ 202 ]\\nIn Europe, about a quarter of people with Bannwarth syndrome (Lyme radiculopathy and lymphocytic meningitis ) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3–6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection in cerebrospinal fluid ; after 12 months, 64% recovered fully, 31% had nondisabling mild or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or required substantial use of analgesics. [ 43 ] The most common lingering nondisabling symptoms were headache, fatigue , altered sensation , joint pains , memory disturbances, malaise , radicular pain , sleep disturbances, muscle pains , and concentration disturbances. Lingering disabling symptoms included facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ]\\nRecovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage. [ 35 ]\\nAbout half the people with Lyme carditis progress to complete heart block , but it usually resolves in a week. [ 46 ] Other Lyme heart conduction abnormalities resolve typically within 6 weeks. [ 46 ] About 94% of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). [ 46 ] Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. [ 46 ] However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal. [ 46 ]\\nRecommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several months for inflammation to resolve and a second round of antibiotics is often necessary. [ 35 ] Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9–14 months (range 4 months – 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery. [ 193 ]\\nReinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6–11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. [ 194 ] The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain. [ 203 ]\\nPost-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [ edit ]\\nChronic symptoms like pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment are experienced by 5–20% of people who contract Lyme disease, even after completing treatment. This is called Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. [ 24 ] [ 204 ]\\nThe cause is unknown. One hypothesis is that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains. However, human and animal trials have not provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. [ 205 ] Another hypothesis is that autoimmunity has been triggered by the infection. Auto–immune responses are known to occur following other infections, including Campylobacter ( Guillain-Barré syndrome ), Chlamydia (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease). A third hypothesis is that debris from \\na previous infection could remain. [ 205 ]\\nAnother hypothesis is that symptoms are simply unrelated to a Lyme infection. [ 206 ] [ 207 ] In studies of people who presented to clinics with concerns about Lyme disease, 47 to 80% had no evidence of Lyme infection while 15 to 55% (median 34%) were able to obtain other diagnoses. [ 205 ]\\nThere is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective in early Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotics are not. They have been shown ineffective in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and is similar to the management of fibromyalgia or ME/CFS . PTLDS usually gets better over time, but recovery may take many months. [ 206 ]\\nEpidemiology and prevalence [ edit ]\\nCountries with reported Lyme disease cases\\nOverview [ edit ]\\nLyme disease occurs regularly in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. [ 208 ]\\nLyme disease effects are comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds.\\n An estimated 476,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated for the disease in the United States. This number is probably an overestimate due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated in Europe. [ 8 ] [ 4 ] [ 209 ]\\nThere is a suggestion that tick populations and Lyme disease occurrence are increasing and spreading into new areas, owing in part to the warming temperatures of climate change . [ 210 ] However, tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. [ 157 ] [ 211 ]\\nNorth America [ edit ]\\nMany studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of I. scapularis projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S. [ 212 ] A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. [ 213 ] The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology . [ 213 ]\\nUnited States [ edit ]\\nCDC map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the Northeast Megalopolis and western Wisconsin\\nLyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ]\\nAlthough Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). [ 90 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria has been modified multiple times. [ 219 ] The 2022 surveillance case definition classifies cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect. [ 220 ] The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.\\n The CDC emphasizes that, while surveillance data has limitations, it is useful due to \\\"uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness.\\\" While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted. [ 221 ] [ 90 ]\\nSeveral similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), also known as Masters disease. Amblyomma americanum , known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment. [ 222 ]\\nIn recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever. [ 218 ]\\nCanada [ edit ]\\nThe range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. [ 112 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] A model-based prediction by Leighton et al. (2012) suggests that the range of the I. scapularis tick will expand into Canada by 46 km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread. [ 226 ]\\nEurope [ edit ]\\nIn Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete B. burgdorferi sensu lato , mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus . [ 227 ] Cases of B. burgdorferi sensu lato -infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. [ 228 ] The number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. [ 229 ] Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising. [ 230 ] Lyme disease is rare in Iceland. On average around 6 to 7 cases are diagnosed every year, primarily localised infections presenting as erythema migrans. None of the cases had a definitive Icelandic origin and the yearly number of cases has not been increasing. [ 231 ]\\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\\nIn the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986 [ 232 ] when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Ireland combined. [ 233 ] In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, [ 234 ] but 973 in 2009 [ 232 ] and 953 in 2010. [ 235 ] Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010. [ 236 ]\\nIt is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year [ 235 ] (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas [ 232 ] ), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 \\\"to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor.\\\" [ 237 ] [ 238 ]\\nDespite Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi infection) being a notifiable disease in Scotland [ 239 ] since January 1990 [ 240 ] which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. [ 241 ] Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. [ 232 ]\\nAlthough there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest , Salisbury Plain , Exmoor , the South Downs , parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire , Thetford Forest [ 242 ] and the West coast and islands of Scotland, [ 243 ] infected ticks are widespread and can even be found in the parks of London. [ 234 ] [ 244 ] A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive , as were between 2% and 4–5% of the general local population of the area. [ 245 ] [ 246 ]\\nTests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] It is speculated that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. [ 249 ] However no published research has proven this to be so.\\nSouth America [ edit ]\\nIn Brazil, Lyme disease is not considered endemic. [ 250 ] A Lyme-like disease known as Baggio–Yoshinari syndrome has been described, attributed to microorganisms that do not belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted by ticks of the Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera. [ 251 ] The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia , São Paulo. [ 252 ] A 2024 analysis concluded that evidence to connect BYS to Borrelia bacteria was lacking. [ 250 ]\\nMexico [ edit ]\\nA 2007 study suggests Borrelia burgdorferi infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000. [ 253 ]\\nAfrica [ edit ]\\nIn northern Africa, B. burgdorferi sensu lato has been identified in Morocco , Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia . [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ]\\nLyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this region. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of Lyme infection in Africa. [ 257 ] In East Africa, two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya . [ 258 ] According The Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa, Lyme disease is not known to be endemic in either South Africa or Mozambique. [ 259 ]\\nAsia [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato -infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China, Nepal , Thailand and far eastern Russia. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Borrelia has also been isolated in Mongolia . [ 262 ]\\nAustraliasia [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is not considered endemic to Australia. [ 263 ] While there have been reports of people acquiring Lyme disease in Australia, and even evidence of closely related Borrelia species in ticks, [ 264 ] the evidence linking these cases to local transmission is limited. Ongoing research on resolving potential Borrelia species to Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT) in Australia are ongoing. [ 265 ]\\nEtymology [ edit ]\\nLyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . [ 266 ]\\nHistory [ edit ]\\nEarly evidence [ edit ]\\nThe earliest known evidence of Lyme disease was found in Oetzi , a 5300 year old mummy in the Eastern Alps near the Italian border. [ 267 ] \\nThe evolutionary history of Borrelia burgdorferi genetics has been examined by scientists. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the Midwest that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. [ 268 ]\\nJohn Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663 to 1670, wrote \\\"there be infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\\\" [ 269 ]\\nThis is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm , a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus , and who found the forests of New York \\\"abound\\\" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. [ 270 ]\\nPerhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. [ 271 ] He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \\\"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\\\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \\\"worm\\\" with a body which is \\\"of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\\\" that \\\"penetrates the skin\\\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. [ 272 ]\\nThe examination of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. [ 270 ] The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman , a 5,300-year-old mummy , revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. [ 273 ]\\nThe early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau , Germany (now Wrocław , Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who for 16 years had had a degenerative skin disorder now known as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans . [ 274 ]\\nAt a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion erythema migrans . [ 274 ] The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911. [ 275 ]\\nModern history [ edit ]\\nThe modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult. [ 276 ]\\nNeurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. [ 277 ] In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.\\n Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. [ 278 ] Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. [ citation needed ] Starting in 1946, facilities in Sweden experimented with treating EM rashes with substances known to kill spirochetes. [ 279 ] Einar Hollström  [ sv ] reported that \\\"penicillin was found to be the most effective.\\\" [ 280 ] In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. [ 281 ] In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe. [ 282 ] [ 283 ]\\nIn 1970 a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin. [ 284 ]\\nThe full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme , which gave the disease its popular name. [ 285 ] This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service , and by others from Yale University , including Stephen Malawista , who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. [ 286 ] The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that \\\"Lyme arthritis\\\" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe. [ 287 ]\\nBefore 1976, the elements of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius's disease, [ 288 ] Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, [ 289 ] [ 290 ] Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis. [ 291 ] [ 292 ]\\nIn 1980, Steere, et al. , began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. [ 293 ] In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer , a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory , with collections of I. dammini [ scapularis ] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed \\\"poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.\\\" Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the \\\"long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.\\\" Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour \\\"offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.\\\" Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. [ 294 ] In June 1982, he published his findings in Science , and the spirochete was named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor. [ 295 ]\\nAfter the identification of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics , amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone . [ 296 ] [ 297 ] The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands. [ 298 ]\\nSociety, culture, and controversy [ edit ]\\nLandscape changes and urbanization [ edit ]\\nUrbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents—the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector , the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. [ 301 ]\\nThe dilution effect [ edit ]\\nGiven these habitat-host dynamics, in 2003 some researchers began to postulate whether the so called dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease. [ 299 ] The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that an increase in host biodiversity will result in a decrease in the number of vectors infected with B. burgdorferi . [ 299 ] Scientific research has shown that nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) decreases as the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect. [ 299 ] That said, there is no direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven. [ 299 ] Additionally, as of 2018, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates [ 302 ]\\nChronic Lyme disease [ edit ]\\nMain article: Chronic Lyme disease\\nThe term \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, [ 303 ] and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] [ 304 ] Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with B. burgdorferi or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing non-specific symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease. [ 305 ]\\nThe 2008 documentary Under Our Skin is known for promoting controversial and unrecognized theories about \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\". [ 306 ]\\nConspiracy theories about origins [ edit ]\\nProlific but unfounded conspiracy theories have alleged that Lyme disease was a biological weapon that originated in the Plum Island laboratory , which is near Old Lyme, Connecticut. [ 307 ] A discredited 2004 book entitled Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory fueled the conspiracy theories. [ 308 ] [ 309 ] Archived specimens show that Lyme disease was endemic well before the establishment of Plum Island laboratory. [ 307 ] Additionally, Lyme disease was never a topic of research at Plum Island, according to the US Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture. [ 310 ] [ 308 ]\\nIn 2024 and 2025, conspiracy theories about the origins of Lyme disease were further spread due to attention from Robert F. Kennedy Jr . [ 311 ]\\nOther animals [ edit ]\\nDogs [ edit ]\\nPrevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step. [ 312 ]\\nAnother crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes ( Amitraz ), phenylpyrazoles ( Fipronil ), or permethrin ( pyrethroids ). [ 313 ] These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. [ 312 ] Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos. [ 313 ]\\nExamination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears. [ 314 ]\\nIn dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, [ 315 ] which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. [ 190 ] Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. [ 316 ] [ verification needed ] In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs. [ 317 ]\\nCats [ edit ]\\nUnlike dogs, it is very rare for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with B. burgdorferi , following a bite from an infected tick. Cats who are infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including but not limited to lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. [ 318 ] In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans. [ 319 ] However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be asymptomatic , and show no noticeable signs of the disease. [ 319 ] [ 318 ] Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required. [ 318 ]\\nHorses [ edit ]\\nLyme disease in horses is often challenging to diagnose because symptoms vary widely. Common acute symptoms include weight loss, fever, lameness , ataxia , and other muscle and joint-related issues. [ 320 ] [ 321 ] [ 322 ] Additional symptoms include muscle tenderness, swollen joints, arthritis , and neck stiffness. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] Chronic symptoms of the disease typically include neurological manifestations, such as meningitis , cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis , and encephalitis . [ 326 ] [ 320 ] [ 327 ] [ 328 ] Furthermore, it is important to note that some horses do not slow clinical signs of Lyme disease. [ 329 ]\\nThere are three main testing strategies used to diagnose horses with Lyme disease. They include clinical evaluation, serological testing , and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. [ 330 ] [ 331 ] [ 321 ] Detection of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine Lyme disease and unspecific testing for antibodies is not recommended. [ 332 ]\\nTypical treatment involves antibiotics such as oxytetracycline , doxycycline , ceftriaxone , or minocycline . [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 329 ] In some cases, a combination of antibiotics may be administered. Doxycycline and minocycline are taken orally, while oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are usually administered intravenously. [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 329 ] The duration and dosage of treatment vary widely among cases. In most cases, the infected horse is euthanized . [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 327 ] [ 336 ] Death of horses as a result of Borrelia burgdorferi infection remains unknown. [ 337 ]\\nCurrently, there is no approved Lyme disease vaccine for horses available. [ 338 ] However, a study demonstrated that ponies could be protected using an aluminum adjuvanted recombinant outer-surface protein A (rOspA) vaccine. [ 339 ] While horses have been administered a Lyme disease vaccine designed for dogs, it elicits only a short-lasting antibody response. [ 338 ] Another study supports the use of commercial Lyme disease vaccines, showing that they do elicit an antibody response, which can be significantly enhanced when horses receive an additional booster vaccine.

Compared to non-immunized guinea pigs, vaccinated animals exposed to infected ticks quickly developed redness at the tick bite site. None of the immunized animals developed Lyme disease if ticks were removed when redness developed. In contrast, about half of the control group became infected with B. burgdorferi after tick removal. When a single infected tick was attached to immunized guinea pigs and not removed, none of vaccinated animals were infected compared to 60 percent of control animals. However, protection waned in immunized guinea pigs if three ticks remained attached to the animal. Ticks in immunized animals were unable to feed aggressively and dislodged more quickly than those on guinea pigs in the control group.\\n^ Sajid A, Matias J, Arora G, Kurokawa C, DePonte K, Tang X, et al.

What is Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi , which you can get if an infected deer tick (also called black-legged tick) bites you. Ordinary \\\"wood ticks\\\" and \\\"dog ticks\\\" don’t carry the infection. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy The first recognition of Lyme disease, also called borreliosis, began in 1975 when many children received a diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Lyme, Connecticut, and two neighboring towns. Researchers found that bites from infected deer ticks were responsible for the outbreak of arthritis. What are the stages (phases) of Lyme disease? Lyme disease may evolve through phases (stages), which can overlap and cause symptoms that may involve the skin, joints, heart or nervous system. These stages are: Early localized Lyme disease (weeks one through four). Early disseminated Lyme disease (months one through four). Late persistent, late disseminated or just late Lyme disease (after four months, even up to years later). How common is Lyme disease? In the United States, about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year. But there are other, diagnosed cases that aren't reported. Signs and Symptoms What are the symptoms of Lyme disease? Signs and symptoms of early Lyme disease typically include: A reddish ras h or skin lesion known as erythema migraines (EM). The rash starts as a small red spot at the site of the tick bite anywhere from one week after to four weeks after the bite. The spot expands over a period of days or weeks, forming a circular, triangular or oval-shaped rash. The rash may look like a bull’s eye because it appears as a red ring that surrounds a clear center area. The rash can range in size from that of a dime to the entire width of a person's back. As infection spreads, several EM rashes (lesions) can appear at different sites on your body. Fever . Headache . Stiff neck. Body and joint aches. Fatigue . Swollen lymph nodes (swollen glands). Advertisement Signs and symptoms of the second stage of Lyme disease (the early disseminated stage) may include: Multiple areas of rash. Paralysis of facial muscles ( Bell's palsy ). Heart block or an interruption of the electrical system of the heart. Areas of numbness or abnormal feelings ( neuropathy ). Signs and symptoms of untreated late Lyme disease, which may happen from months to a year after infection, may include: Recurring episodes of swollen joints ( arthritis ). This typically affects large joints like the knee. Difficulty concentrating, known as “brain fog.” This is a form of encephalopathy or damage to the brain. Damage to nerves all over your body, including your skin, muscles and organs (polyneuropathy). Diagnosis and Tests How is Lyme disease diagnosed? A healthcare provider will diagnose Lyme disease based on symptoms, physical findings (like a rash) and whether or not you've been in an area populated by infected ticks. Many people don’t remember or know that they’ve been bitten by a tick. This is because the tick is tiny, and its bite is usually painless. Your provider will confirm the diagnosis using a blood test. If your first blood test is negative for Lyme disease, you won't need another test. If the first test is positive or equivocal, your provider will conduct the test again. You have to have two positive (or sometimes equivocal) results to be diagnosed with Lyme disease. Management and Treatment How is Lyme disease treated? Antibiotics , usually doxycycline or amoxicillin, are effective treatments for Lyme disease. How long your treatment lasts depends on the stage of infection. In general, it’s true that the sooner you’re treated, the quicker and more complete the recovery. Pregnant women should receive treatment for Lyme disease as well. There is, however, no evidence that a fetus can get the infection from its birth mother. There’s also no strong evidence that miscarriages are more likely after Lyme disease. What should I do if a tick bites me? If a tick bites you, the best way to remove it is by taking the following steps: Tug gently but firmly with blunt tweezers near the \\\"head\\\" of the tick at the level of your skin until it releases its hold on your skin. Avoid crushing the tick's body or handling the tick with bare fingers because you could expose yourself to the bacteria in the tick. Wash the bite area thoroughly with soap and water. Don't use kerosene, petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline®) or hot cigarette butts to remove the tick. Don't squeeze the tick's body with your fingers or tweezers. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can Lyme disease be prevented? Most people with Lyme disease get the infection during the late spring, summer and early fall when immature ticks are out feeding. In warm climates, few tick bites take place during winter months. Advertisement Deer ticks are most often found in wooded areas and nearby grasslands. They’re especially common where the two areas merge, including neighborhood yards where deer occasionally roam. Ticks don’t survive long on sunny lawns. They dry out quickly and die. Although only about 1% of all deer ticks carry Lyme disease-causing bacteria, there are areas in which over 50% of the ticks carry the bacterium. The diseased ticks are often found in the U.S. Northeast and upper Midwest areas. Ticks also live in coastal areas. Black-legged ticks can get the infection from animals other than deer. Mice, voles and some squirrels can carry the bacteria. How can I prevent tick bites? The following tips can help you avoid tick bites: To repel ticks, you may want to spray your clothing with permethrin, an insecticide commonly found in lawn and garden stores. Insect repellents that contain a chemical called DEET can also be applied to clothing or directly onto your skin. Read the labels carefully. Don’t overuse it. Too much may be harmful. Minimize skin exposure to both ticks and insect repellents by wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts that fit tightly at the ankles and wrists. Wear a hat, tuck your pant legs into socks and wear shoes that leave no part of your feet exposed. Wear light-colored clothing to make it easier to detect ticks. Walk in the center of trails to avoid picking up ticks from overhanging grass and brush. After outdoor activities in an \\\"at risk\\\" area, always do a tick check and then shower, scrubbing with a washcloth. Get rid of any ticks on your clothes by putting them in the dryer for 15 minutes. This will kill any ticks attached to the clothes by drying them out. Pets may bring ticks into your home. Discuss ways to prevent ticks on your pet with your veterinarian. Advertisement Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for someone with Lyme disease? Most of the people who get Lyme disease and receive treatment early will be fine. Treatment can cure Lyme disease but you might still have some long-term effects. Untreated Lyme disease may contribute to other serious problems but it’s rarely fatal. Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome Even after proper treatment, some people (estimated at 5% to 15%) may experience lingering fatigue, achiness or headaches. This is known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome or PTLDS. The symptoms don’t mean that you still have an infection. PTLDS probably won’t respond to additional antibiotics. The majority of people in this group will have symptoms that resolve at some point over the next six months. Chronic Lyme disease Chronic Lyme disease is a term used by some for a condition in a person who had Lyme disease and the symptoms of PTLDS. Some people consider chronic Lyme disease to be the same as PTLDS. However, some people receive a chronic Lyme disease diagnosis without a Lyme disease diagnosis. Sometimes, extended treatment with antibiotics helps. This term may be why some people think a Lyme disease infection can occur without being bitten by a tick. There isn't enough proof that mosquitoes can transmit Lyme disease. Many researchers dislike using the term “chronic Lyme disease.” Advertisement Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? If you feel sick after having spent time in areas where ticks might live, you should make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If you received a Lyme disease diagnosis and you don’t feel well after taking all of your antibiotics, contact your provider. This is especially true if you have symptoms like a stiff neck or mental confusion. Additional Common Questions Can Lyme disease completely be cured? Taking oral antibiotics typically cures Lyme disease after two to four weeks. You may need to get antibiotics through the vein (intravenously) for four more weeks. However, there’s no reason to think that Lyme disease stays in you forever after treatment. A note from Cleveland Clinic If you’re going to spend time in an area that might have ticks, take measures to avoid being bitten. This includes wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants to make it harder for ticks to bite. If you feel sick after being in an area that probably has ticks, make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If your provider prescribes antibiotics, make sure you take all of them as instructed. Care at Cleveland Clinic Cleveland Clinic’s primary care providers offer lifelong medical care.

At first, Lyme disease usually causes symptoms such as a rash , fever , headache , and fatigue . But if it is not treated early, the infection can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. Prompt treatment can help you recover quickly.\\nWhat causes Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is caused by bacteria. In the United States, this is usually a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi . It spreads to humans through the bite of an infected tick. The ticks that spread it are blacklegged ticks (or deer ticks). They are usually found in the:\\nNortheast\\nMid-Atlantic\\nUpper Midwest\\nPacific coast, especially northern California\\nThese ticks can attach to any part of your body. But they are often found in hard-to-see areas such as your groin, armpits, and scalp. Usually, the tick must be attached to you for more than 24 hours to spread the bacterium to you.\\nWho is more likely to get Lyme disease?\\nMost tick bites happen in the warmer months (April-September), when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can also get bitten during the rest of the year, especially if the temperatures are warmer than usual.\\nMost tick bites happen in the summer months when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can get bitten in the warmer months of early fall, or even late winter if temperatures are unusually high. And if there is a mild winter, ticks may come out earlier than usual.\\nWhat are the symptoms of Lyme disease?\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease start between 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bites you. The symptoms can include:\\nA red rash called erythema migrans (EM). Most people with Lyme disease get this rash. It gets bigger over several days and may feel warm. It is usually not painful or itchy. As it starts to get better, parts of it may fade. Sometimes this makes the rash look like a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\nFever\\nChills\\nHeadache\\nFatigue\\nMuscle and joint aches\\nSwollen lymph nodes (\\\"swollen glands\\\")\\nIf the infection is not treated, it can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. The symptoms may include:\\nSevere headaches and neck stiffness.\\nMore EM rashes on other areas of your body.\\nFacial palsy, which is a weakness in your facial muscles. It can cause drooping on one or both sides of your face.\\nArthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, especially in your knees and other large joints.\\nPain that comes and goes in your tendons, muscles, joints, and bones.\\nHeart palpitations, which are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast.\\nAn irregular heart beat (Lyme carditis).\\nEpisodes of dizziness or shortness of breath.\\nInflammation of the brain and spinal cord.\\nNerve pain.\\nShooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet.\\nHow is Lyme disease diagnosed?\\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider will consider:\\nYour symptoms\\nHow likely it is that you were exposed to infected blacklegged ticks\\nHow likely it is that you could have other illnesses that cause similar symptoms\\nThe results of any lab tests\\nMost Lyme disease tests check for antibodies made by the body in response to infection. These antibodies can take several weeks to develop. If you are tested right away, it may not show that you have Lyme disease, even if you have it. So you may need to have another test later.\\nWhat are the treatments for Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is treated with antibiotics . The earlier you are treated, the better; it gives you the best chance of fully recovering quickly.\\nAfter treatment, some patients may still have pain, fatigue, or difficulty thinking that lasts more than 6 months. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Researchers don't know why some people have PTLDS. There is no proven treatment for PTLDS; long-term antibiotics have not been shown to help. However, there are ways to help with the symptoms of PTLDS. If you have been treated for Lyme disease and still feel unwell, contact your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms. Most people do get better with time. But it can take several months before you feel better.\\nCan Lyme disease be prevented?\\nTo prevent Lyme disease, you should lower your risk of getting a tick bite:\\nAvoid areas where ticks live, such as grassy, brushy, or wooded areas.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash , known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. [ 1 ] The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. [ 1 ] Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. [ 1 ] Early diagnosis can be difficult. [ 11 ] Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness . [ 1 ] If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face , joint pains , severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations . [ 1 ] Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. [ 1 ] Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. [ 1 ]\\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes . [ 12 ] In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , \\\"In most cases, a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.\\\" [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In North America, the bacterial species Borrelia burgdorferi and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease. [ 4 ] [ 16 ] In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii , Borrelia garinii , B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. [ 4 ] The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals nor through food. [ 13 ] Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. [ 5 ] [ 17 ] Blood tests are often falsely negative in the early stages of the disease. [ 4 ] Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. [ 18 ]\\nPrevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin -based insect repellents . [ 4 ] [ 9 ] Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. [ 4 ] Ticks can be removed using tweezers . [ 19 ] If the removed tick is full of blood a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent the development of infection but is not generally recommended since the development of infection is rare. [ 4 ] If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime . [ 4 ] Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. [ 4 ] Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment, which may last for one or two days. [ 4 ] In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. [ 4 ] [ 20 ]\\nLyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. [ 21 ] [ 8 ] Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. [ 4 ] Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . [ 22 ] The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer . [ 23 ] People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). [ 24 ] PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease , a term no longer supported by scientists and used in different ways by different groups. [ 20 ] [ 25 ] Some healthcare providers claim that chronic Lyme is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment. [ 26 ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] , clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced, but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. [ 27 ] There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nSigns and symptoms [ edit ]\\nLyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms.\\n20% of Lyme rashes in the United States show a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" appearance. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]\\nErythema migrans (\\\"migrating redness\\\") on a woman's neck. [ 31 ] Rashes from non-Lyme causes may look similar. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]\\nThe incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). [ 34 ] Lyme symptoms most often occur from the month of May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases. [ 34 ]\\nEarly localized infection [ edit ]\\n80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit , groin , back of the knee , or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (median is 16 cm). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] [ 32 ]\\nThe rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. [ 4 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM) which translates as \\\"migrating redness.\\\" In about 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges possibly forming a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" pattern, but this clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. [ 32 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. [ 4 ]\\nThe Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms. [ 4 ]\\nPeople with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis . [ 35 ]\\nNot everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms, and many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases. [ 36 ]\\nAsymptomatic infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States. [ 37 ] Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe. [ 38 ]\\nEarly disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nWithin days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the Borrelia bacteria may spread through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10–20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. [ 28 ] Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common. [ 28 ]\\nIn about 10–15% of untreated people, Lyme causes neurological problems known as neuroborreliosis . [ 39 ] Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4–6 weeks (range 1–12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy, and/or mononeuritis multiplex. [ 35 ] [ 40 ] Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. [ 41 ] After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms . Up to 76.5% of them present as tinnitus , the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness (53.7%) and hearing loss (16.7%) were the next most common symptoms. [ 42 ] In children, partial loss of vision may also occur. [ 35 ] Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves . When due to Lyme, it most typically causes facial palsy , impairing blinking, smiling, and chewing on one or both sides of the face. It may also cause intermittent double vision . [ 35 ] [ 41 ] Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness , numbness , or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots , e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. [ 39 ] [ 35 ] Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord , with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech , impaired movement , impaired motor planning , or shaking . [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn North America, facial palsy is the typical early neuroborreliosis presentation, occurring in 5–10% of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. [ 35 ] [ 44 ] Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. [ 45 ] In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome , accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ] In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. [ 38 ] In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%). [ 40 ]\\nIn about 4–10% of untreated cases in the United States and 0.3–4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days to 7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness , fainting , shortness of breath , and chest pain . [ 46 ] Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches , facial palsy , headaches , or radicular pain . [ 46 ] In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis in 19–87% of people adversely impacts the heart's electrical conduction system, causing atrioventricular block that often manifests as heart rhythms that alternate within minutes between abnormally slow and abnormally fast. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 10–15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly , left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure. [ 46 ]\\nAnother skin condition, found in Europe but not in North America, is borrelial lymphocytoma , a purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum . [ 48 ]\\nLate disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nLyme arthritis caused this 3-year-old girl's knee to become swollen. Though painless, it did make her limp. [ 49 ]\\nLyme arthritis occurs in up to 60% of untreated people, typically starting about six months after infection. [ 28 ] It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip , other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint . [ 35 ] [ 50 ] Usually, large joint effusion and swelling occur, but only mild or moderate pain. [ 35 ] Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time, but periodically return. [ 35 ] Baker's cysts may form and rupture.\\n In early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and over time possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis that discovered poor documentation of this manifestation, experts wondered if it exists at all in the US or is merely very rare. [ 35 ] [ 51 ]\\nA neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia , a general sense of feeling unwell , and changes in personality. [ 52 ] Lyme encephalopathy is controversial in the US and has not been reported in Europe. [ 8 ] Problems such as depression and fibromyalgia are as common in people with Lyme disease as in the general population. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] There is no compelling evidence that Lyme disease causes psychiatric disorders, behavioral disorders (e.g. ADHD ), or developmental disorders (e.g. autism ). [ 55 ]\\nAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly. [ 48 ] It begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. [ 56 ] It is also associated with peripheral neuropathy. [ 51 ]\\nCause [ edit ]\\nMain article: Lyme disease microbiology\\nFurther information: Weather and climate effects on Lyme disease exposure\\nBorrelia bacteria, the causative agents of Lyme disease, magnified\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochetes , gram-negative bacteria from the genus Borrelia . Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella . [ 57 ] The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato , and show a great deal of genetic diversity . [ 58 ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato is a species complex made up of 20 accepted and three proposed genospecies. Eight species are known to cause Lyme disease: B. mayonii (found in North America), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (found in North America and Europe), B. afzelii , B. garinii, B. spielmanii, and B. lusitaniae (all found in Eurasia ). [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 16 ] [ 10 ] Some studies have also proposed that B. valaisiana may sometimes infect humans, but this species does not seem to be an important cause of disease. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]\\nTick life cycle [ edit ]\\nDeer tick life cycle\\nIxodes scapularis , the primary vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America\\nThree stages occur in the life cycle of a tick - larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and are usually most active in late spring and early summer in regions where the climate is mild. During the adult stage, Lyme disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and tend to be larger in size, so can be easily seen and removed. [ 63 ]\\nTransmission [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is classified as a zoonosis , as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts . [ 64 ] Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia ). [ 65 ] Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage , because they are very small, thus may feed for long periods of time undetected. [ 64 ] Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. [ 66 ] Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. [ 67 ] The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected. [ 68 ] Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Borrelia from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse , and occasionally birds. [ 69 ] Areas where Lyme is common are expanding. [ 70 ]\\nWithin the tick midgut, the Borrelia ' s outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the Borrelia downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection. [ 71 ] Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC. [ 72 ]\\nTick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. [ 73 ]\\nWhile B. burgdorferi is most associated with ticks hosted by white-tailed deer and white-footed mice , Borrelia afzelii is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto . The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association. [ 74 ]\\nBudding research has suggested that B. burgdorferi sensu lato may also be able to form enzootic cycle among lizard populations; [ 75 ] this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations of lizards, such as California. Except for one study in Europe, [ 74 ] much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia , it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific. [ 79 ]\\nTick Ixodes ricinus , developmental stages\\nIn Europe, the main vector is Ixodes ricinus , which is also called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. [ 80 ] In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector. [ 81 ] In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) is the main vector on the East Coast. [ 68 ]\\nThe lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as Texas , is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes , [ 82 ] though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness , which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease. [ 83 ]\\nOn the West Coast of the United States , the main vector is the western black-legged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ). [ 84 ] The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the western fence lizard that are resistant to Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West. [ 85 ] [ 79 ]\\nTransmission can occur across the placenta during pregnancy and as with a number of other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\\nThere is no scientific evidence to support Lyme disease transmission via blood transfusion, sexual contact, or breast milk. [ 90 ]\\nTick-borne co-infections [ edit ]\\nMain article: Tick-borne disease\\nTicks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other microbes, such as Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. [ 91 ] Among people with early Lyme disease, depending on their location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–10% will have babesiosis. [ 55 ] Ticks in certain regions also transmit viruses that cause tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan virus disease . [ 92 ] [ 55 ] Co-infections of Lyme disease may not require additional treatment, since they may resolve on their own or—as in the case of HGA—can be treated with the doxycycline prescribed for Lyme. [ 35 ] Persistent fever or compatible anomalous laboratory findings may be indicative of a co-infection. [ 55 ]\\nPathophysiology [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. [ 72 ] [ 93 ] B. Burgdorferi does not produce toxins. [ 94 ] Therefore, many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to spirochete in those tissues. [ 95 ]\\nB. burgdorferi is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. [ 96 ] Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. [ 97 ] This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis . The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. [ 72 ] Neutrophils , however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body. [ 98 ]\\nDays to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete. [ 99 ]\\nIf untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. [ 100 ] The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement , and hiding in the extracellular matrix , which may interfere with the function of immune factors. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]\\nImmunological studies [ edit ]\\nExposure to the Borrelia bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging inflammatory response , [ 103 ] a form of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease. [ 104 ] The production of this reaction might be due to a form of molecular mimicry , where Borrelia avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]\\nChronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever , but its wider application is controversial. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash, facial palsy , or arthritis ), history of possible exposure to infected ticks , and possibly laboratory tests . [ 4 ] [ 28 ] People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1–2 months. [ 35 ] Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common , within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull's eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms. [ 4 ] [ 111 ] In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota , but it is expanding into other areas. [ 70 ] Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk. [ 112 ]\\nIn the absence of an EM rash or history of tick exposure, Lyme diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation. [ 65 ] [ 113 ] The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time-consuming to grow in the laboratory. [ 4 ] [ 65 ] The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. [ 114 ] A positive antibody test result does not by itself prove active infection but can confirm an infection that is suspected because of symptoms, objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. [ 65 ] Because as many as 5–20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be tested for Lyme antibodies: a positive result would likely be false, possibly causing unnecessary treatment. [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available. [ 44 ] [ 115 ]\\nLaboratory testing [ edit ]\\nTests for antibodies in the blood by ELISA and Western blot is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. [ 116 ] The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2–4 weeks and 4–6 weeks, and peak at 6–8 weeks. [ 117 ] When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. [ 35 ] Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. [ 117 ] A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false-positive result. [ 118 ] The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4–6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years. [ 117 ]\\nOther tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii and almost always involves lymphocytic pleocytosis , i.e. the densities of lymphocytes (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Demonstration by lumbar puncture and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans , which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). [ 40 ] In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative. [ 119 ] American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat. [ 43 ] In infection involving the PNS, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment. [ 41 ]\\nIn Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography may show myocardial dysfunction. [ 46 ] Biopsy and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure. [ 46 ]\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material ( DNA ) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia . PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. [ 121 ] [ 40 ] Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during infection. [ 122 ] [ 40 ] Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid. [ 123 ] Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people. [ 40 ]\\nSeveral other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. OspA antigens , shed by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. [ 124 ] The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years. [ 127 ]\\nThe CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of B. burgdorferi , and lymphocyte transformation tests. [ 122 ]\\nImaging [ edit ]\\nNeuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis , but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. [ 128 ] Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vasculitis and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease , which makes them questionable. [ 129 ]\\nDifferential diagnosis [ edit ]\\nCommunity clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23–28% of erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. [ 113 ] EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites , cellulitis , or shingles . [ 113 ] Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull's eye. [ 4 ] Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2–3 cm/day and a diameter of at least 5 cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. [ 28 ] [ 32 ] Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee. [ 28 ] Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve's dermatome , and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. [ 130 ]\\nFacial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy . [ 44 ] Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. [ 44 ] Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. [ 44 ] Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. [ 44 ] Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. [ 44 ]\\nUnlike viral meningitis , Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy , or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF . [ 35 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the limbs is often misdiagnosed as a radiculopathy caused by nerve root compression, such as sciatica . [ 113 ] [ 131 ] Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4–6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating risks of other possible causes that, although less frequent, require immediate diagnosis and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. [ 132 ] A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms of lymphocytic meningitis, or facial palsy would lead to suspicion of Lyme disease and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation. [ 132 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and acute coronary syndrome . [ 45 ] [ 113 ] Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new \\\"great imitator\\\". [ 133 ] As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms. [ 134 ]\\nPrevention [ edit ]\\nTick bites may be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. [ 135 ] [ 9 ]\\nMost Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. [ 28 ] [ 135 ] Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands , shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. [ 28 ] [ 136 ] Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\\\"quest\\\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. [ 138 ] In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. [ 137 ] Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. [ 137 ] [ 135 ] In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. [ 137 ] Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. [ 137 ] [ 139 ] Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. [ 136 ]\\nAs a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. [ 135 ] [ 140 ] Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. [ 141 ] After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). [ 141 ] Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. [ 139 ] Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. [ 139 ] Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. [ 142 ] Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. [ 140 ] Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. [ 140 ] [ 143 ]\\nThe EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET , picaridin , IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD) . [ 135 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. [ 140 ] The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. [ 145 ] Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. [ 145 ] Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. [ 140 ] [ 144 ] Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). [ 140 ] [ 135 ] If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. [ 140 ] Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. [ 140 ]\\nAfter coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. [ 135 ] Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or warm dryer are not enough). [ 135 ] Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduce risk of infection. [ 135 ] Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister . [ 146 ] The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair. [ 135 ]\\nTick removal [ edit ]\\nRemoval of a tick using tweezers\\nAttached ticks should be removed promptly. Risk of infection increases with time of attachment, but in North America risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. [ 147 ] CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from the skin without twisting, jerking, squeezing or crushing the tick. [ 148 ] After tick removal, any tick parts remaining in the skin should be removed with a clean tweezer, if possible. [ 148 ] The wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. [ 148 ] The tick may be disposed by placing it in a container with alcohol, sealed bag, tape or flushed down the toilet. [ 148 ] The bitten person should write down where and when the bite happened so that this can be informed to a doctor if the person gets a rash or flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. [ 148 ] CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it. [ 148 ]\\nIn Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. [ 149 ] Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. [ 149 ] Another method consists in using about 20 cm of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]\\nPreventive antibiotics [ edit ]\\nThe risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. [ 28 ] It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. [ 28 ] If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70–80% of people infected). [ 4 ] [ 28 ]\\nGarden landscaping [ edit ]\\nSeveral landscaping practices may reduce the risk of tick bites in residential yards. [ 146 ] [ 152 ] These include keeping lawns mown, removing leaf litter and weeds and avoiding the use of ground cover. [ 146 ] A 3-ft-wide rock or woodchip barrier is recommended to separate lawns from wood piles, woodlands , stone walls and shrubs. [ 152 ] Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it to kill ticks. [ 152 ] A sun-exposed tick-safe zone at least 9 ft from the barrier should concentrate human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. [ 152 ] Materials such as wood decking, concrete, bricks, gravel or woodchips used on the ground under patios and playgrounds would discourage ticks there. [ 146 ] An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone. [ 152 ] [ 146 ]\\nOccupational exposure [ edit ]\\nOutdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active. [ 155 ]\\nHost animals [ edit ]\\nTicks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards , birds , mice , cats , dogs , deer , cattle and humans . The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \\\"dilution hosts\\\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and so decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. White-tailed deer are both a food source and a \\\"reproductive host\\\", where ticks tend to mate. [ 156 ] The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. Availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted. [ 157 ]\\nIn the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine , [ 158 ] and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. [ 159 ] Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. [ 160 ] While these studies have found these effects, other studies have found opposite effects. A study done in Massachusetts removed deer and did not see a significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. [ 161 ] Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to effectively control tick populations. [ 162 ] One study summarized the results of multiple studies all looking at deer reduction controlling tick populations and determined that deer control can't be used as a standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that since most of the studies looking at this are not good representatives of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. [ 163 ] There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen, would decrease Lyme disease risk the most. [ 164 ]\\nOthers have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not Borrelia burgdorferi reservoirs. This is because it was found that white-tailed deer blood actually kills the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. [ 165 ] Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks , may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission. [ 157 ]\\nTick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. [ 166 ] They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals through the use of acaricides has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on a number of grounds. Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment. [ 167 ]\\nIn Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). [ 168 ] These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. [ 168 ] \\\"The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus ; [ 169 ] \\\" it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi \\\" thought Jaenson & al. (1992) [ 170 ] (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, [ 171 ] as red deer and wild boars ( Sus scrofa ), [ 169 ] in which one Rickettsia and three Borrelia species were identified\\\", [ 169 ] with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. [ 172 ] Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe \\\" two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified \\\". [ 169 ]\\nVaccination [ edit ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] no human vaccines for Lyme disease were available. [ 27 ] The only human vaccine to advance to market was LYMErix, which was available from 1998, but discontinued in 2002. [ 173 ] The vaccine candidate VLA15 was scheduled to start a phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2022, with other research ongoing. Multiple vaccines are available for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nLYMErix [ edit ]\\nThe vaccine LYMErix was available from 1998 to 2002. The recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, was developed by SmithKline Beecham . In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine was found to confer protective immunity to Lyme disease in 76% of adults after three doses with only mild or moderate and transient adverse effects . [ 174 ] [ 175 ] On 21 December 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix on the basis of these trials for persons of ages 15 through 70. [ 175 ] [ 173 ]\\nFollowing approval of the vaccine , its entry into clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. [ 176 ] Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline , alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints. [ 177 ]\\nDespite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, [ 178 ] in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. [ 177 ] [ 179 ] The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a \\\"cautionary tale\\\"; [ 179 ] an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which \\\"unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.\\\" [ 180 ] The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told Nature : \\\"This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.\\\" [ 177 ] [ 181 ]\\nVLA15 [ edit ]\\nThe hexavalent (OspA) protein subunit-based vaccine candidate VLA15 was developed by Valneva . It was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017. [ 182 ] [ 183 ] In April 2020 Pfizer paid $130 million for the rights to the vaccine, and the companies are developing it together, performing multiple phase 2 trials. [ 184 ]\\nA phase 3 trial of VLA15 was scheduled for late 2022, recruiting volunteers at test sites located across the northeastern United States and in Europe. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Participants were scheduled to receive an initial three-dose series of vaccines over the course of five to nine months, followed by a booster dose after twelve months, with both the initial series and the booster dose scheduled to be complete before the year's peak Lyme disease season. [ 186 ]\\nOther research [ edit ]\\nAn mRNA vaccine designed to cause a strong fast immune response to tick saliva allowed the immune system to detect and remove the ticks from test animals before they were able to transmit the infectious bacteria. [ 187 ] The vaccine contains mRNAs for the body to build 19 proteins in tick saliva which, by enabling quick development of erythema (itchy redness) at the bite site, protects guinea pigs against Lyme disease. It also protected the test animals if the tick is not removed if only one tick, but not three, remain attached. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\\nCanine vaccines [ edit ]\\nCanine vaccines have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet- Schering-Plough 's vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA . The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial , generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog. [ 190 ]\\nTreatment [ edit ]\\nAntibiotics are the primary treatment. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. [ 28 ] For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. [ 28 ] People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns . [ 35 ] Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; [ 28 ] alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , and azithromycin . [ 28 ] Azithromycin is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. [ 35 ] The standard treatment for cellulitis , cephalexin , is not useful for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , as these are effective against both infections. [ 35 ] Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy , radiculopathy , meningitis , or peripheral neuropathy . [ 28 ] Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; [ 28 ] cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives. [ 28 ]\\nTreatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7–14 days in early localized disease, to 14–21 days in early disseminated disease to 14–28 days in late disseminated disease. [ 55 ] Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. [ 120 ] In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone . [ 120 ] Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. [ 28 ] [ 35 ] Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no evidence shows it to be effective. [ 28 ] [ 191 ] IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. [ 28 ] As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. [ 28 ]\\nFacial palsy may resolve without treatment: however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. [ 35 ] Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. [ 44 ] In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. [ 44 ] [ 192 ]\\nAbout a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids. [ 46 ]\\nPeople with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping should use crutches. [ 193 ] Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [ 35 ] Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. [ 35 ] [ 193 ] People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for Borrelia DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. [ 35 ] [ 55 ] [ 193 ] Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy , or physical therapy. [ 55 ] [ 193 ]\\nPeople receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it . [ 115 ]\\nPrognosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease's typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. [ 4 ] However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues. [ 35 ]\\nPeople who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. [ 113 ] Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64–71% at end of treatment for EM rash to about 84–90% after 30 months; higher percentages are reported in Europe. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Treatment failure, i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. [ 194 ] Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g. joint or muscle pains or fatigue . [ 196 ] These symptoms are usually mild and nondisabling. [ 196 ]\\nPeople treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits, in addition to subjective symptoms. [ 35 ] In Europe, an average of 32–33 months after initial Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14–21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with only an EM rash (16%). [ 197 ] In another European study, 5 years after treatment for neuroborreliosis lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter were less common among those treated within 30 days of the first symptom (16%) than among those treated later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated. [ 198 ]\\nSome data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] However, in Europe 41% of people treated for facial palsy had other lingering symptoms at followup up to 6 months later, including 28% with numbness or altered sensation and 14% with fatigue or concentration problems. [ 200 ] Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. [ 199 ] [ 201 ] Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another one is voluntarily moved) can become evident only 6–12 months after facial palsy appears to be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. [ 202 ] Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. [ 202 ] In longer-term follow-up, 16–23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover. [ 202 ]\\nIn Europe, about a quarter of people with Bannwarth syndrome (Lyme radiculopathy and lymphocytic meningitis ) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3–6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection in cerebrospinal fluid ; after 12 months, 64% recovered fully, 31% had nondisabling mild or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or required substantial use of analgesics. [ 43 ] The most common lingering nondisabling symptoms were headache, fatigue , altered sensation , joint pains , memory disturbances, malaise , radicular pain , sleep disturbances, muscle pains , and concentration disturbances. Lingering disabling symptoms included facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ]\\nRecovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage. [ 35 ]\\nAbout half the people with Lyme carditis progress to complete heart block , but it usually resolves in a week. [ 46 ] Other Lyme heart conduction abnormalities resolve typically within 6 weeks. [ 46 ] About 94% of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). [ 46 ] Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. [ 46 ] However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal. [ 46 ]\\nRecommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several months for inflammation to resolve and a second round of antibiotics is often necessary. [ 35 ] Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9–14 months (range 4 months – 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery. [ 193 ]\\nReinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6–11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. [ 194 ] The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain. [ 203 ]\\nPost-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [ edit ]\\nChronic symptoms like pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment are experienced by 5–20% of people who contract Lyme disease, even after completing treatment. This is called Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. [ 24 ] [ 204 ]\\nThe cause is unknown. One hypothesis is that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains. However, human and animal trials have not provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. [ 205 ] Another hypothesis is that autoimmunity has been triggered by the infection. Auto–immune responses are known to occur following other infections, including Campylobacter ( Guillain-Barré syndrome ), Chlamydia (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease). A third hypothesis is that debris from \\na previous infection could remain. [ 205 ]\\nAnother hypothesis is that symptoms are simply unrelated to a Lyme infection. [ 206 ] [ 207 ] In studies of people who presented to clinics with concerns about Lyme disease, 47 to 80% had no evidence of Lyme infection while 15 to 55% (median 34%) were able to obtain other diagnoses. [ 205 ]\\nThere is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective in early Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotics are not. They have been shown ineffective in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and is similar to the management of fibromyalgia or ME/CFS . PTLDS usually gets better over time, but recovery may take many months. [ 206 ]\\nEpidemiology and prevalence [ edit ]\\nCountries with reported Lyme disease cases\\nOverview [ edit ]\\nLyme disease occurs regularly in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. [ 208 ]\\nLyme disease effects are comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds.\\n An estimated 476,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated for the disease in the United States. This number is probably an overestimate due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated in Europe. [ 8 ] [ 4 ] [ 209 ]\\nThere is a suggestion that tick populations and Lyme disease occurrence are increasing and spreading into new areas, owing in part to the warming temperatures of climate change . [ 210 ] However, tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. [ 157 ] [ 211 ]\\nNorth America [ edit ]\\nMany studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of I. scapularis projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S. [ 212 ] A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. [ 213 ] The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology . [ 213 ]\\nUnited States [ edit ]\\nCDC map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the Northeast Megalopolis and western Wisconsin\\nLyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ]\\nAlthough Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). [ 90 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria has been modified multiple times. [ 219 ] The 2022 surveillance case definition classifies cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect. [ 220 ] The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.\\n The CDC emphasizes that, while surveillance data has limitations, it is useful due to \\\"uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness.\\\" While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted. [ 221 ] [ 90 ]\\nSeveral similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), also known as Masters disease. Amblyomma americanum , known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment. [ 222 ]\\nIn recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever. [ 218 ]\\nCanada [ edit ]\\nThe range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. [ 112 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] A model-based prediction by Leighton et al. (2012) suggests that the range of the I. scapularis tick will expand into Canada by 46 km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread. [ 226 ]\\nEurope [ edit ]\\nIn Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete B. burgdorferi sensu lato , mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus . [ 227 ] Cases of B. burgdorferi sensu lato -infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. [ 228 ] The number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. [ 229 ] Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising. [ 230 ] Lyme disease is rare in Iceland. On average around 6 to 7 cases are diagnosed every year, primarily localised infections presenting as erythema migrans. None of the cases had a definitive Icelandic origin and the yearly number of cases has not been increasing. [ 231 ]\\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\\nIn the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986 [ 232 ] when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Ireland combined. [ 233 ] In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, [ 234 ] but 973 in 2009 [ 232 ] and 953 in 2010. [ 235 ] Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010. [ 236 ]\\nIt is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year [ 235 ] (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas [ 232 ] ), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 \\\"to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor.\\\" [ 237 ] [ 238 ]\\nDespite Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi infection) being a notifiable disease in Scotland [ 239 ] since January 1990 [ 240 ] which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. [ 241 ] Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. [ 232 ]\\nAlthough there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest , Salisbury Plain , Exmoor , the South Downs , parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire , Thetford Forest [ 242 ] and the West coast and islands of Scotland, [ 243 ] infected ticks are widespread and can even be found in the parks of London. [ 234 ] [ 244 ] A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive , as were between 2% and 4–5% of the general local population of the area. [ 245 ] [ 246 ]\\nTests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] It is speculated that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. [ 249 ] However no published research has proven this to be so.\\nSouth America [ edit ]\\nIn Brazil, Lyme disease is not considered endemic. [ 250 ] A Lyme-like disease known as Baggio–Yoshinari syndrome has been described, attributed to microorganisms that do not belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted by ticks of the Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera. [ 251 ] The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia , São Paulo. [ 252 ] A 2024 analysis concluded that evidence to connect BYS to Borrelia bacteria was lacking. [ 250 ]\\nMexico [ edit ]\\nA 2007 study suggests Borrelia burgdorferi infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000. [ 253 ]\\nAfrica [ edit ]\\nIn northern Africa, B. burgdorferi sensu lato has been identified in Morocco , Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia . [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ]\\nLyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this region. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of Lyme infection in Africa. [ 257 ] In East Africa, two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya . [ 258 ] According The Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa, Lyme disease is not known to be endemic in either South Africa or Mozambique. [ 259 ]\\nAsia [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato -infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China, Nepal , Thailand and far eastern Russia. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Borrelia has also been isolated in Mongolia . [ 262 ]\\nAustraliasia [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is not considered endemic to Australia. [ 263 ] While there have been reports of people acquiring Lyme disease in Australia, and even evidence of closely related Borrelia species in ticks, [ 264 ] the evidence linking these cases to local transmission is limited. Ongoing research on resolving potential Borrelia species to Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT) in Australia are ongoing. [ 265 ]\\nEtymology [ edit ]\\nLyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . [ 266 ]\\nHistory [ edit ]\\nEarly evidence [ edit ]\\nThe earliest known evidence of Lyme disease was found in Oetzi , a 5300 year old mummy in the Eastern Alps near the Italian border. [ 267 ] \\nThe evolutionary history of Borrelia burgdorferi genetics has been examined by scientists. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the Midwest that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. [ 268 ]\\nJohn Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663 to 1670, wrote \\\"there be infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\\\" [ 269 ]\\nThis is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm , a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus , and who found the forests of New York \\\"abound\\\" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. [ 270 ]\\nPerhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. [ 271 ] He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \\\"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\\\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \\\"worm\\\" with a body which is \\\"of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\\\" that \\\"penetrates the skin\\\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. [ 272 ]\\nThe examination of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. [ 270 ] The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman , a 5,300-year-old mummy , revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. [ 273 ]\\nThe early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau , Germany (now Wrocław , Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who for 16 years had had a degenerative skin disorder now known as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans . [ 274 ]\\nAt a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion erythema migrans . [ 274 ] The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911. [ 275 ]\\nModern history [ edit ]\\nThe modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult. [ 276 ]\\nNeurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. [ 277 ] In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.\\n Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. [ 278 ] Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. [ citation needed ] Starting in 1946, facilities in Sweden experimented with treating EM rashes with substances known to kill spirochetes. [ 279 ] Einar Hollström  [ sv ] reported that \\\"penicillin was found to be the most effective.\\\" [ 280 ] In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. [ 281 ] In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe. [ 282 ] [ 283 ]\\nIn 1970 a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin. [ 284 ]\\nThe full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme , which gave the disease its popular name. [ 285 ] This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service , and by others from Yale University , including Stephen Malawista , who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. [ 286 ] The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that \\\"Lyme arthritis\\\" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe. [ 287 ]\\nBefore 1976, the elements of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius's disease, [ 288 ] Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, [ 289 ] [ 290 ] Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis. [ 291 ] [ 292 ]\\nIn 1980, Steere, et al. , began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. [ 293 ] In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer , a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory , with collections of I. dammini [ scapularis ] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed \\\"poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.\\\" Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the \\\"long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.\\\" Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour \\\"offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.\\\" Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. [ 294 ] In June 1982, he published his findings in Science , and the spirochete was named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor. [ 295 ]\\nAfter the identification of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics , amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone . [ 296 ] [ 297 ] The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands. [ 298 ]\\nSociety, culture, and controversy [ edit ]\\nLandscape changes and urbanization [ edit ]\\nUrbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents—the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector , the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. [ 301 ]\\nThe dilution effect [ edit ]\\nGiven these habitat-host dynamics, in 2003 some researchers began to postulate whether the so called dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease. [ 299 ] The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that an increase in host biodiversity will result in a decrease in the number of vectors infected with B. burgdorferi . [ 299 ] Scientific research has shown that nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) decreases as the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect. [ 299 ] That said, there is no direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven. [ 299 ] Additionally, as of 2018, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates [ 302 ]\\nChronic Lyme disease [ edit ]\\nMain article: Chronic Lyme disease\\nThe term \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, [ 303 ] and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] [ 304 ] Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with B. burgdorferi or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing non-specific symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease. [ 305 ]\\nThe 2008 documentary Under Our Skin is known for promoting controversial and unrecognized theories about \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\". [ 306 ]\\nConspiracy theories about origins [ edit ]\\nProlific but unfounded conspiracy theories have alleged that Lyme disease was a biological weapon that originated in the Plum Island laboratory , which is near Old Lyme, Connecticut. [ 307 ] A discredited 2004 book entitled Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory fueled the conspiracy theories. [ 308 ] [ 309 ] Archived specimens show that Lyme disease was endemic well before the establishment of Plum Island laboratory. [ 307 ] Additionally, Lyme disease was never a topic of research at Plum Island, according to the US Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture. [ 310 ] [ 308 ]\\nIn 2024 and 2025, conspiracy theories about the origins of Lyme disease were further spread due to attention from Robert F. Kennedy Jr . [ 311 ]\\nOther animals [ edit ]\\nDogs [ edit ]\\nPrevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step. [ 312 ]\\nAnother crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes ( Amitraz ), phenylpyrazoles ( Fipronil ), or permethrin ( pyrethroids ). [ 313 ] These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. [ 312 ] Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos. [ 313 ]\\nExamination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears. [ 314 ]\\nIn dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, [ 315 ] which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. [ 190 ] Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. [ 316 ] [ verification needed ] In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs. [ 317 ]\\nCats [ edit ]\\nUnlike dogs, it is very rare for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with B. burgdorferi , following a bite from an infected tick. Cats who are infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including but not limited to lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. [ 318 ] In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans. [ 319 ] However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be asymptomatic , and show no noticeable signs of the disease. [ 319 ] [ 318 ] Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required. [ 318 ]\\nHorses [ edit ]\\nLyme disease in horses is often challenging to diagnose because symptoms vary widely. Common acute symptoms include weight loss, fever, lameness , ataxia , and other muscle and joint-related issues. [ 320 ] [ 321 ] [ 322 ] Additional symptoms include muscle tenderness, swollen joints, arthritis , and neck stiffness. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] Chronic symptoms of the disease typically include neurological manifestations, such as meningitis , cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis , and encephalitis . [ 326 ] [ 320 ] [ 327 ] [ 328 ] Furthermore, it is important to note that some horses do not slow clinical signs of Lyme disease. [ 329 ]\\nThere are three main testing strategies used to diagnose horses with Lyme disease. They include clinical evaluation, serological testing , and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. [ 330 ] [ 331 ] [ 321 ] Detection of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine Lyme disease and unspecific testing for antibodies is not recommended. [ 332 ]\\nTypical treatment involves antibiotics such as oxytetracycline , doxycycline , ceftriaxone , or minocycline . [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 329 ] In some cases, a combination of antibiotics may be administered. Doxycycline and minocycline are taken orally, while oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are usually administered intravenously. [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 329 ] The duration and dosage of treatment vary widely among cases. In most cases, the infected horse is euthanized . [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 327 ] [ 336 ] Death of horses as a result of Borrelia burgdorferi infection remains unknown. [ 337 ]\\nCurrently, there is no approved Lyme disease vaccine for horses available. [ 338 ] However, a study demonstrated that ponies could be protected using an aluminum adjuvanted recombinant outer-surface protein A (rOspA) vaccine. [ 339 ] While horses have been administered a Lyme disease vaccine designed for dogs, it elicits only a short-lasting antibody response. [ 338 ] Another study supports the use of commercial Lyme disease vaccines, showing that they do elicit an antibody response, which can be significantly enhanced when horses receive an additional booster vaccine.

Compared to non-immunized guinea pigs, vaccinated animals exposed to infected ticks quickly developed redness at the tick bite site. None of the immunized animals developed Lyme disease if ticks were removed when redness developed. In contrast, about half of the control group became infected with B. burgdorferi after tick removal. When a single infected tick was attached to immunized guinea pigs and not removed, none of vaccinated animals were infected compared to 60 percent of control animals. However, protection waned in immunized guinea pigs if three ticks remained attached to the animal. Ticks in immunized animals were unable to feed aggressively and dislodged more quickly than those on guinea pigs in the control group.\\n^ Sajid A, Matias J, Arora G, Kurokawa C, DePonte K, Tang X, et al.

What is Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi , which you can get if an infected deer tick (also called black-legged tick) bites you. Ordinary \\\"wood ticks\\\" and \\\"dog ticks\\\" don’t carry the infection. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy The first recognition of Lyme disease, also called borreliosis, began in 1975 when many children received a diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Lyme, Connecticut, and two neighboring towns. Researchers found that bites from infected deer ticks were responsible for the outbreak of arthritis. What are the stages (phases) of Lyme disease? Lyme disease may evolve through phases (stages), which can overlap and cause symptoms that may involve the skin, joints, heart or nervous system. These stages are: Early localized Lyme disease (weeks one through four). Early disseminated Lyme disease (months one through four). Late persistent, late disseminated or just late Lyme disease (after four months, even up to years later). How common is Lyme disease? In the United States, about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year. But there are other, diagnosed cases that aren't reported. Signs and Symptoms What are the symptoms of Lyme disease? Signs and symptoms of early Lyme disease typically include: A reddish ras h or skin lesion known as erythema migraines (EM). The rash starts as a small red spot at the site of the tick bite anywhere from one week after to four weeks after the bite. The spot expands over a period of days or weeks, forming a circular, triangular or oval-shaped rash. The rash may look like a bull’s eye because it appears as a red ring that surrounds a clear center area. The rash can range in size from that of a dime to the entire width of a person's back. As infection spreads, several EM rashes (lesions) can appear at different sites on your body. Fever . Headache . Stiff neck. Body and joint aches. Fatigue . Swollen lymph nodes (swollen glands). Advertisement Signs and symptoms of the second stage of Lyme disease (the early disseminated stage) may include: Multiple areas of rash. Paralysis of facial muscles ( Bell's palsy ). Heart block or an interruption of the electrical system of the heart. Areas of numbness or abnormal feelings ( neuropathy ). Signs and symptoms of untreated late Lyme disease, which may happen from months to a year after infection, may include: Recurring episodes of swollen joints ( arthritis ). This typically affects large joints like the knee. Difficulty concentrating, known as “brain fog.” This is a form of encephalopathy or damage to the brain. Damage to nerves all over your body, including your skin, muscles and organs (polyneuropathy). Diagnosis and Tests How is Lyme disease diagnosed? A healthcare provider will diagnose Lyme disease based on symptoms, physical findings (like a rash) and whether or not you've been in an area populated by infected ticks. Many people don’t remember or know that they’ve been bitten by a tick. This is because the tick is tiny, and its bite is usually painless. Your provider will confirm the diagnosis using a blood test. If your first blood test is negative for Lyme disease, you won't need another test. If the first test is positive or equivocal, your provider will conduct the test again. You have to have two positive (or sometimes equivocal) results to be diagnosed with Lyme disease. Management and Treatment How is Lyme disease treated? Antibiotics , usually doxycycline or amoxicillin, are effective treatments for Lyme disease. How long your treatment lasts depends on the stage of infection. In general, it’s true that the sooner you’re treated, the quicker and more complete the recovery. Pregnant women should receive treatment for Lyme disease as well. There is, however, no evidence that a fetus can get the infection from its birth mother. There’s also no strong evidence that miscarriages are more likely after Lyme disease. What should I do if a tick bites me? If a tick bites you, the best way to remove it is by taking the following steps: Tug gently but firmly with blunt tweezers near the \\\"head\\\" of the tick at the level of your skin until it releases its hold on your skin. Avoid crushing the tick's body or handling the tick with bare fingers because you could expose yourself to the bacteria in the tick. Wash the bite area thoroughly with soap and water. Don't use kerosene, petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline®) or hot cigarette butts to remove the tick. Don't squeeze the tick's body with your fingers or tweezers. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can Lyme disease be prevented? Most people with Lyme disease get the infection during the late spring, summer and early fall when immature ticks are out feeding. In warm climates, few tick bites take place during winter months. Advertisement Deer ticks are most often found in wooded areas and nearby grasslands. They’re especially common where the two areas merge, including neighborhood yards where deer occasionally roam. Ticks don’t survive long on sunny lawns. They dry out quickly and die. Although only about 1% of all deer ticks carry Lyme disease-causing bacteria, there are areas in which over 50% of the ticks carry the bacterium. The diseased ticks are often found in the U.S. Northeast and upper Midwest areas. Ticks also live in coastal areas. Black-legged ticks can get the infection from animals other than deer. Mice, voles and some squirrels can carry the bacteria. How can I prevent tick bites? The following tips can help you avoid tick bites: To repel ticks, you may want to spray your clothing with permethrin, an insecticide commonly found in lawn and garden stores. Insect repellents that contain a chemical called DEET can also be applied to clothing or directly onto your skin. Read the labels carefully. Don’t overuse it. Too much may be harmful. Minimize skin exposure to both ticks and insect repellents by wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts that fit tightly at the ankles and wrists. Wear a hat, tuck your pant legs into socks and wear shoes that leave no part of your feet exposed. Wear light-colored clothing to make it easier to detect ticks. Walk in the center of trails to avoid picking up ticks from overhanging grass and brush. After outdoor activities in an \\\"at risk\\\" area, always do a tick check and then shower, scrubbing with a washcloth. Get rid of any ticks on your clothes by putting them in the dryer for 15 minutes. This will kill any ticks attached to the clothes by drying them out. Pets may bring ticks into your home. Discuss ways to prevent ticks on your pet with your veterinarian. Advertisement Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for someone with Lyme disease? Most of the people who get Lyme disease and receive treatment early will be fine. Treatment can cure Lyme disease but you might still have some long-term effects. Untreated Lyme disease may contribute to other serious problems but it’s rarely fatal. Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome Even after proper treatment, some people (estimated at 5% to 15%) may experience lingering fatigue, achiness or headaches. This is known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome or PTLDS. The symptoms don’t mean that you still have an infection. PTLDS probably won’t respond to additional antibiotics. The majority of people in this group will have symptoms that resolve at some point over the next six months. Chronic Lyme disease Chronic Lyme disease is a term used by some for a condition in a person who had Lyme disease and the symptoms of PTLDS. Some people consider chronic Lyme disease to be the same as PTLDS. However, some people receive a chronic Lyme disease diagnosis without a Lyme disease diagnosis. Sometimes, extended treatment with antibiotics helps. This term may be why some people think a Lyme disease infection can occur without being bitten by a tick. There isn't enough proof that mosquitoes can transmit Lyme disease. Many researchers dislike using the term “chronic Lyme disease.” Advertisement Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? If you feel sick after having spent time in areas where ticks might live, you should make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If you received a Lyme disease diagnosis and you don’t feel well after taking all of your antibiotics, contact your provider. This is especially true if you have symptoms like a stiff neck or mental confusion. Additional Common Questions Can Lyme disease completely be cured? Taking oral antibiotics typically cures Lyme disease after two to four weeks. You may need to get antibiotics through the vein (intravenously) for four more weeks. However, there’s no reason to think that Lyme disease stays in you forever after treatment. A note from Cleveland Clinic If you’re going to spend time in an area that might have ticks, take measures to avoid being bitten. This includes wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants to make it harder for ticks to bite. If you feel sick after being in an area that probably has ticks, make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If your provider prescribes antibiotics, make sure you take all of them as instructed. Care at Cleveland Clinic Cleveland Clinic’s primary care providers offer lifelong medical care.

At first, Lyme disease usually causes symptoms such as a rash , fever , headache , and fatigue . But if it is not treated early, the infection can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. Prompt treatment can help you recover quickly.\\nWhat causes Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is caused by bacteria. In the United States, this is usually a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi . It spreads to humans through the bite of an infected tick. The ticks that spread it are blacklegged ticks (or deer ticks). They are usually found in the:\\nNortheast\\nMid-Atlantic\\nUpper Midwest\\nPacific coast, especially northern California\\nThese ticks can attach to any part of your body. But they are often found in hard-to-see areas such as your groin, armpits, and scalp. Usually, the tick must be attached to you for more than 24 hours to spread the bacterium to you.\\nWho is more likely to get Lyme disease?\\nMost tick bites happen in the warmer months (April-September), when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can also get bitten during the rest of the year, especially if the temperatures are warmer than usual.\\nMost tick bites happen in the summer months when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can get bitten in the warmer months of early fall, or even late winter if temperatures are unusually high. And if there is a mild winter, ticks may come out earlier than usual.\\nWhat are the symptoms of Lyme disease?\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease start between 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bites you. The symptoms can include:\\nA red rash called erythema migrans (EM). Most people with Lyme disease get this rash. It gets bigger over several days and may feel warm. It is usually not painful or itchy. As it starts to get better, parts of it may fade. Sometimes this makes the rash look like a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\nFever\\nChills\\nHeadache\\nFatigue\\nMuscle and joint aches\\nSwollen lymph nodes (\\\"swollen glands\\\")\\nIf the infection is not treated, it can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. The symptoms may include:\\nSevere headaches and neck stiffness.\\nMore EM rashes on other areas of your body.\\nFacial palsy, which is a weakness in your facial muscles. It can cause drooping on one or both sides of your face.\\nArthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, especially in your knees and other large joints.\\nPain that comes and goes in your tendons, muscles, joints, and bones.\\nHeart palpitations, which are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast.\\nAn irregular heart beat (Lyme carditis).\\nEpisodes of dizziness or shortness of breath.\\nInflammation of the brain and spinal cord.\\nNerve pain.\\nShooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet.\\nHow is Lyme disease diagnosed?\\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider will consider:\\nYour symptoms\\nHow likely it is that you were exposed to infected blacklegged ticks\\nHow likely it is that you could have other illnesses that cause similar symptoms\\nThe results of any lab tests\\nMost Lyme disease tests check for antibodies made by the body in response to infection. These antibodies can take several weeks to develop. If you are tested right away, it may not show that you have Lyme disease, even if you have it. So you may need to have another test later.\\nWhat are the treatments for Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is treated with antibiotics . The earlier you are treated, the better; it gives you the best chance of fully recovering quickly.\\nAfter treatment, some patients may still have pain, fatigue, or difficulty thinking that lasts more than 6 months. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Researchers don't know why some people have PTLDS. There is no proven treatment for PTLDS; long-term antibiotics have not been shown to help. However, there are ways to help with the symptoms of PTLDS. If you have been treated for Lyme disease and still feel unwell, contact your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms. Most people do get better with time. But it can take several months before you feel better.\\nCan Lyme disease be prevented?\\nTo prevent Lyme disease, you should lower your risk of getting a tick bite:\\nAvoid areas where ticks live, such as grassy, brushy, or wooded areas. If you are hiking, walk in the center of the trail to avoid brush and grass.\\nUse an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent when you go outdoors. They are evaluated to make sure they are safe and effective. Make sure that the repellant has one of these ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. It is important to follow the instructions on the label.\\nTreat your clothing and gear with a repellant containing 0.5% permethrin\\nWear light-colored protective clothing, so you can easily see any ticks that get on you\\nWear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants. Also tuck your shirt into your pants and your pant legs into your socks.\\nCheck yourself, your children, and your pets daily for ticks. Carefully remove any ticks you find.\\nTake a shower and wash and dry your clothes at high temperatures after being outdoors\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\nStart Here\\nAbout Lyme Disease\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nLyme Disease\\n(American Academy of Family Physicians)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nLyme Disease\\n(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)\\nTicks and Lyme Disease: Symptoms, Treatment, and Prevention\\n(Food and Drug Administration)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nSymptoms\\nSigns and Symptoms of Untreated Lyme Disease\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nDiagnosis and Tests\\nLyme Disease Tests\\n(National Library of Medicine)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nPrevention and Risk Factors\\nHow Lyme Disease Spreads\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nPreventing Tick Bites\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nTick Removal: A Step-by-Step Guide (For Parents)\\n(Nemours Foundation)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nTravelers' Health: Mosquitoes, Ticks, and Other Arthropods\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nRelated Issues\\nNeurological Complications of Lyme Disease\\n(National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke)\\nSpecifics\\nChronic Lyme Disease\\n(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)\\nChronic Symptoms and Lyme Disease\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nGenetics\\nLyme disease: MedlinePlus Genetics\\n(National Library of Medicine)\\nImages\\nLyme Disease\\n(VisualDX)\\nStatistics and Research\\nLyme Disease Surveillance and Data\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nClinical Trials\\nClinicalTrials.gov: Lyme Disease\\n(National Institutes of Health)\\nClinicalTrials.gov: Post-Lyme Disease Syndrome\\n(National Institutes of Health)\\nJournal Articles\\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\\nArticle: Estimation of medically-attended LB incidence in Norway, Finland and Poland using...\\nArticle: Of Lyme disease and machine learning in a One Health world.\\nArticle: Tick-borne encephalitis vaccination in persons with a recent history of Lyme...\\nLyme Disease -- see more articles\\nFind an Expert\\nAmerican Lyme Disease Foundation\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\nAlso in Spanish\\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\\nChildren\\nLyme Disease (For Kids)\\n(Nemours Foundation)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nLyme Disease (For Parents)\\n(Nemours Foundation)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nTeenagers\\nLyme Disease\\n(Nemours Foundation)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nLyme Disease\\n(VisualDX)\\nPatient Handouts\\nLyme disease\\n(Medical Encyclopedia)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nLyme disease blood test\\n(Medical Encyclopedia)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nTopic Image\\nMEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA\\nLyme disease\\nLyme disease - what to ask your doctor\\nLyme disease blood test\\nRelated Health Topics\\nTick Bites\\nNational Institutes of Health\\nThe primary NIH organization for research on\\n Lyme Disease is the\\n National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\\nOther Languages\\nFind health information in languages other than English on Lyme Disease\\nNIH MedlinePlus Magazine\\nOn the Front Lines Against Lyme Disease\\nDisclaimers\\nMedlinePlus links to health information from the National Institutes of Health and other federal government agencies.

The rash may feel warm but is rarely itchy or painful.\\n- **Flu-like symptoms**: Fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint aches.\\n\\n### Early Disseminated Stage (weeks to months post-bite)\\nIf the disease is not treated, *Borrelia* can spread through the blood:\\n- Multiple rashes appearing on different body parts.\\n- Neuroborreliosis symptoms: Facial palsy (weakness in facial muscles), neck stiffness, and potentially serious irregular heart rhythms (Lyme carditis).\\n\\n### Late Stage (months to years post-bite)\\n- **Lyme arthritis**: Recurring pain and swelling in large joints, especially the knees.\\n- Possible neurological issues, including cognitive difficulties (often referred to as \\\"brain fog\\\") and other chronic symptoms that can persist post-treatment.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis is typically based on clinical findings, specifically a history of tick exposure and the identification of symptoms, especially the characteristic rash. In some cases, serological testing may also be used to confirm the presence of antibodies against *Borrelia* spp. \\n\\n### Testing Protocol\\n1. **ELISA**: The initial test with high sensitivity.\\n2. **Western Blot**: A more specific secondary test if the ELISA result is positive.\\n\\n### Challenges\\nEarly testing may yield false negatives due to insufficient antibody production. \\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe primary treatment for Lyme disease is antibiotics. The specific choice of antibiotic and duration may vary based on disease stage:\\n- **For early localized disease**: Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime.\\n- **For advanced stages**: Intravenous ceftriaxone is often the treatment of choice for cases involving the heart or nervous system.\\n\\n### Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)\\nSome individuals may experience lingering symptoms, including fatigue and muscle pain, even after completing antibiotic treatment.

This disease is transmitted through bites from infected black-legged ticks, commonly called deer ticks. Lyme disease is found in various areas, particularly in the northeastern United States, parts of the Midwest, and multiple regions in Europe and Asia.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can appear in several stages, with each stage showing different health challenges:\\n\\n### Early Localized Stage (1-4 weeks post-bite)\\n- **Erythema migrans (EM)**: A \\\"bull's-eye\\\" rash usually develops within 3-30 days after a tick bite. This rash can feel warm but is generally not itchy or painful.\\n- **Flu-like symptoms**: These may include fever, chills, fatigue, headaches, and muscle or joint pains.\\n\\n### Early Disseminated Stage (weeks to months post-bite)\\nIf untreated, the *Borrelia* bacteria can spread through the bloodstream:\\n- Multiple rashes can appear on various parts of the body.\\n- Symptoms of neuroborreliosis: Weakness in facial muscles (facial palsy), neck stiffness, and possibly severe heart rhythm issues (known as Lyme carditis).\\n\\n### Late Stage (months to years post-bite)\\n- **Lyme arthritis**: This can cause recurring pain and swelling in large joints, particularly in the knees.\\n- Neurological problems may arise, which can include cognitive difficulties, often described as \\\"brain fog,\\\" and other persistent chronic symptoms even after treatment.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease usually involves assessing symptoms and history of tick exposure, particularly checking for the characteristic rash. In some cases, blood tests may be utilized to confirm the presence of antibodies against *Borrelia*.\\n\\n### Testing Protocol\\n1. **ELISA Test**: The initial screening test known for its sensitivity.\\n2. **Western Blot Test**: A more specific follow-up test if the ELISA is positive.\\n\\n### Challenges\\nEarly testing might yield false negatives as the body may not have produced enough antibodies yet.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe main treatment for Lyme disease is antibiotics. The specific antibiotic used and the duration of treatment can differ based on the disease's stage:\\n- **For early localized disease**: Common antibiotics include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime.\\n- **For advanced stages**: Intravenous ceftriaxone may be necessary, especially for cases affecting the heart or nervous system.\\n\\n### Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)\\nSome patients may continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue and muscle pain despite completing antibiotic treatment, a condition known as PTLDS.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventing Lyme disease primarily revolves around avoiding tick bites, which can be managed by:\\n- Applying insect repellent containing DEET or permethrin onto clothing.\\n- Wearing protective clothing like long sleeves and pants in wooded or grassy areas.\\n- Conducting tick checks after being outdoors.\\n- Removing any ticks promptly with fine-tipped tweezers.\\n\\n### Environmental Control\\nManaging your surroundings can significantly reduce tick populations and their habitats to lower exposure risk.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease can be effectively treated, especially with early diagnosis. Understanding the symptoms, taking appropriate preventive steps, and seeking timely medical care are crucial in managing the disease and minimizing long-lasting complications.

The rash may feel warm but is rarely itchy or painful.\\n- **Flu-like symptoms**: Fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint aches.\\n\\n### Early Disseminated Stage (weeks to months post-bite)\\nIf the disease is not treated, *Borrelia* can spread through the blood:\\n- Multiple rashes appearing on different body parts.\\n- Neuroborreliosis symptoms: Facial palsy (weakness in facial muscles), neck stiffness, and potentially serious irregular heart rhythms (Lyme carditis).\\n\\n### Late Stage (months to years post-bite)\\n- **Lyme arthritis**: Recurring pain and swelling in large joints, especially the knees.\\n- Possible neurological issues, including cognitive difficulties (often referred to as \\\"brain fog\\\") and other chronic symptoms that can persist post-treatment.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis is typically based on clinical findings, specifically a history of tick exposure and the identification of symptoms, especially the characteristic rash. In some cases, serological testing may also be used to confirm the presence of antibodies against *Borrelia* spp. \\n\\n### Testing Protocol\\n1. **ELISA**: The initial test with high sensitivity.\\n2. **Western Blot**: A more specific secondary test if the ELISA result is positive.\\n\\n### Challenges\\nEarly testing may yield false negatives due to insufficient antibody production. \\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe primary treatment for Lyme disease is antibiotics. The specific choice of antibiotic and duration may vary based on disease stage:\\n- **For early localized disease**: Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime.\\n- **For advanced stages**: Intravenous ceftriaxone is often the treatment of choice for cases involving the heart or nervous system.\\n\\n### Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)\\nSome individuals may experience lingering symptoms, including fatigue and muscle pain, even after completing antibiotic treatment. This condition is termed PTLDS.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventing Lyme disease primarily involves avoiding tick bites by:\\n- Using insect repellents containing DEET or permethrin on clothing.\\n- Wearing protective clothing (long sleeves and pants).\\n- Performing tick checks after outdoor activities, especially in wooded or grassy areas.\\n- Promptly removing ticks with fine-tipped tweezers.\\n\\n### Environmental Control\\nReducing exposure by managing landscape environments can greatly diminish tick habitats.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease can be treated effectively, especially if diagnosed early. Awareness of symptoms, appropriate preventive measures, and timely medical intervention are critical in controlling the spread of the disease and reducing the risk of long-term complications.

Overview\\nThe common cold is a viral infection that mainly affects the upper parts of the respiratory system, particularly the nose and throat. There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds are more frequent during the colder months because people tend to stay indoors, which helps the viruses spread. Generally, a cold lasts for less than a week, although individual experiences may vary.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe first signs of a cold usually include:\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny nose\\n- Coughing\\n- Sneezing\\n- General feeling of being unwell\\n\\nThese symptoms typically intensify within 2 to 3 days after exposure to the virus. As the cold develops, other symptoms may appear, such as:\\n- Body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Low-grade fever\\n- Nasal congestion\\n\\nMost symptoms begin to improve within 7 to 10 days, but they can linger longer in smokers or those with other health conditions.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and spread easily from person to person. The common ways they are transmitted include:\\n- **Respiratory droplets**: When a sick person coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the virus are released into the air.\\n- **Surface contact**: The virus can survive on surfaces for some time. If someone touches a contaminated surface and then touches their face, they can become infected.\\n\\nCrowded places, like schools and public transportation, increase the likelihood of catching a cold.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors can make individuals more likely to catch a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are often more at risk due to their developing immune systems.\\n- **Health status**: Individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic health issues are also more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle choices**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can negatively impact respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Being in crowded or close quarters can lead to easier viral transmission.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nWhile most colds are mild, they can sometimes lead to more serious complications, including:\\n- **Middle ear infections**: More common in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: This is an inflammation of the sinuses that can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Asthma attacks**: People with asthma may experience worsening of their symptoms.\\n- **Serious respiratory illnesses**: In rare cases, colds can lead to severe health issues, especially among vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nTo reduce the risk of catching or spreading a cold, consider these preventive measures:\\n- **Hand washing**: Wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer when soap is not available.\\n- **Avoid close contact**: Steer clear of sick individuals to minimize the chance of transmission.\\n- **Cleaning surfaces**: Regularly disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs and light switches.\\n- **Healthy living**: Maintain a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly to help strengthen the immune system.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no specific cure for the common cold. However, relief from symptoms can often be achieved with over-the-counter medications, such as:\\n- **Pain relievers**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce pain and fever.\\n- **Decongestants**: These medications can alleviate nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines and cough suppressants**: These can help relieve throat irritation and cough.\\n\\nAlways consult a healthcare provider before giving any medications to children.\\n\\n## 8.

Overview\\nThe common cold is primarily a viral infection that targets the upper respiratory tract, specifically the nose and throat. It is caused by a wide range of viruses, with over 200 types identified, the most notable being rhinoviruses. Colds are particularly prevalent during colder months, with incidence rates increasing as people congregate indoors. The typical duration of a cold is less than a week, although the length can vary based on individual immunity and health.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms\\nThe onset of a cold is marked by early symptoms such as a sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and general malaise. These symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days post-infection. As the cold progresses, additional symptoms may arise, including body aches, headaches, low-grade fevers, and nasal congestion. Most cold symptoms start to improve within 7 to 10 days, although some may persist longer in individuals who smoke.\\n\\n## 3. Transmission\\nThe common cold is highly contagious. It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Additionally, it can be transmitted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus followed by touching one’s face. This mode of transmission is especially prominent in crowded settings like schools, public transport, and gatherings.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors\\nSeveral factors increase the risk of contracting a cold:\\n- **Age**: Young children are at a higher risk due to their still-developing immune systems.\\n- **Immune System**: Individuals with weakened immune systems owing to underlying health issues are more susceptible.\\n- **Lifestyle**: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke exacerbate risk by impairing respiratory health.\\n- **Environment**: Crowded locations enhance virus transmission likelihood, particularly in schools and public transport systems.\\n\\n## 5. Complications\\nAlthough the common cold is generally mild, it can lead to several complications, including:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation of the sinuses can occur as a secondary infection.\\n- **Exacerbation of Asthma**: Individuals with asthma may experience worsened symptoms.\\n- **Severe Respiratory Diseases**: In rare cases, colds can lead to more severe conditions, especially in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention\\nPreventive measures include:\\n- **Hand Hygiene**: Regularly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizers are effective when soap is unavailable.\\n- **Avoiding Contact**: Keeping distance from individuals who are symptomatic can reduce transmission risk.\\n- **Disinfection**: Regular cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces to eliminate viral presence.\\n- **Healthy Lifestyle**: A balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and regular exercise can fortify the immune system against infections.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no specific cure for the common cold. Relief from symptoms can be achieved through over-the-counter medications such as:\\n- **Pain Relievers**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for headaches and body aches.\\n- **Decongestants**: To alleviate nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines and Cough Suppressants**: To help manage throat irritation and coughing.\\n\\nConsultation with a healthcare provider is crucial before administering any medications to children.\\n\\n## 8.

When to Seek Medical Care\\nIf symptoms worsen or do not improve after 7 to 10 days, or if more severe symptoms such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain occur, it is important to seek medical help as there may be a need to rule out more serious conditions.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, consider checking these resources:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Common Cold Senior Summarizer\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}], \"token_usage\": {\"total_tokens\": 35191, \"prompt_tokens\": 32512, \"cached_prompt_tokens\": 11648, \"completion_tokens\": 2679, \"successful_requests\": 8}}, {\"raw\": \"# Comprehensive Report on Influenza (Flu)\\n\\n## Introduction\\nInfluenza, commonly referred to as the flu, is an infectious illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily impact the respiratory system, including the nose, throat, and lungs. This disease is known for its sudden onset of symptoms and can lead to severe health complications if not treated effectively. It's important to understand the nature, transmission, prevention, treatment, and historical context of influenza to minimize its effects on public health.\\n\\n## Types of Influenza Viruses\\nInfluenza viruses are categorized into four main types:\\n\\n1. **Influenza A**: This is the most widespread type of influenza virus responsible for causing seasonal outbreaks and pandemics. It can infect various animals, including birds and pigs, as well as humans. Influenza A is often associated with the most severe illness during flu seasons.\\n\\n2. **Influenza B**: Predominantly found in humans, this type causes seasonal outbreaks but does not lead to widespread pandemics. Vaccines targeting influenza B are included in the annual flu vaccination.\\n\\n3. **Influenza C**: This type causes mild respiratory infections and is less frequent than types A and B. It does not typically lead to significant outbreaks or severe health issues.\\n\\n4. **Influenza D**: Mainly affects cattle and does not pose a direct threat to human health, as it rarely infects people.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can survive on surfaces, making it possible for individuals to become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their faces. Understanding these transmission methods is crucial for effective prevention.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms generally appear between one to four days after exposure and can last anywhere from two to eight days. Common symptoms include:\\n\\n- **Fever**: A high temperature is often present.\\n- **Cough**: Frequent and persistent.\\n- **Sore throat**: Discomfort while swallowing.\\n- **Muscle aches**: General body pain and discomfort.\\n- **Headache**: Pain in the head region.\\n- **Fatigue**: A deep sense of tiredness.\\n- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Such as diarrhea and vomiting, particularly more common in children.\\n\\nSymptoms can be intense and may lead to further health issues if not managed appropriately.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nThe most effective ways to prevent influenza include:\\n\\n- **Annual flu vaccines**: Recommended for everyone aged six months and older, these vaccines protect against multiple strains of influenza A and B.\\n- **Good hygiene practices**: Regular handwashing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and cleaning commonly touched surfaces can help prevent infection.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nWhen it comes to treating influenza, standard approaches include:\\n\\n- **Supportive care**: For mild cases, rest, staying hydrated, and over-the-counter medications can help manage symptoms.\\n- **Antiviral medications**: Drugs like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be used, especially for severe cases or for individuals at high risk of complications.\\n\\n## Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations including:\\n\\n- **Pneumonia**: Life-threatening lung infection.\\n- **Bronchitis**: Inflammation of the airways.\\n- **Sinus and ear infections**: Secondary infections that may develop.\\n- **Worsening of chronic conditions**: Such as asthma or heart disease.\\n\\nYoung children, older adults, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing health issues are especially at risk for severe influenza impact.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nInfluenza causes seasonal epidemics, especially in temperate regions, with peaks during winter months.

This rash can feel warm but is generally not itchy or painful.\\n- **Flu-like symptoms**: These may include fever, chills, fatigue, headaches, and muscle or joint pains.\\n\\n### Early Disseminated Stage (weeks to months post-bite)\\nIf untreated, the *Borrelia* bacteria can spread through the bloodstream:\\n- Multiple rashes can appear on various parts of the body.\\n- Symptoms of neuroborreliosis: Weakness in facial muscles (facial palsy), neck stiffness, and possibly severe heart rhythm issues (known as Lyme carditis).\\n\\n### Late Stage (months to years post-bite)\\n- **Lyme arthritis**: This can cause recurring pain and swelling in large joints, particularly in the knees.\\n- Neurological problems may arise, which can include cognitive difficulties, often described as \\\"brain fog,\\\" and other persistent chronic symptoms even after treatment.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease usually involves assessing symptoms and history of tick exposure, particularly checking for the characteristic rash. In some cases, blood tests may be utilized to confirm the presence of antibodies against *Borrelia*.\\n\\n### Testing Protocol\\n1. **ELISA Test**: The initial screening test known for its sensitivity.\\n2. **Western Blot Test**: A more specific follow-up test if the ELISA is positive.\\n\\n### Challenges\\nEarly testing might yield false negatives as the body may not have produced enough antibodies yet.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe main treatment for Lyme disease is antibiotics. The specific antibiotic used and the duration of treatment can differ based on the disease's stage:\\n- **For early localized disease**: Common antibiotics include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime.\\n- **For advanced stages**: Intravenous ceftriaxone may be necessary, especially for cases affecting the heart or nervous system.\\n\\n### Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)\\nSome patients may continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue and muscle pain despite completing antibiotic treatment, a condition known as PTLDS.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventing Lyme disease primarily revolves around avoiding tick bites, which can be managed by:\\n- Applying insect repellent containing DEET or permethrin onto clothing.\\n- Wearing protective clothing like long sleeves and pants in wooded or grassy areas.\\n- Conducting tick checks after being outdoors.\\n- Removing any ticks promptly with fine-tipped tweezers.\\n\\n### Environmental Control\\nManaging your surroundings can significantly reduce tick populations and their habitats to lower exposure risk.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease can be effectively treated, especially with early diagnosis. Understanding the symptoms, taking appropriate preventive steps, and seeking timely medical care are crucial in managing the disease and minimizing long-lasting complications. Ongoing research remains essential to improve our understanding, treatment options, and possible vaccination development.\\n\\n## References\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html)\\n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease)\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11586-lyme-disease)\\n- [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/lymedisease.html)\\n- [Penn Medicine](https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/lyme-disease)\\n- [AVMA on Lyme Disease in Dogs](https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/lyme-disease-dogs)\\n\\nThis report captures essential insights and recommendations regarding Lyme disease, encompassing its understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Lyme Disease Senior Summarizer\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}], \"token_usage\": {\"total_tokens\": 222941, \"prompt_tokens\": 219571, \"cached_prompt_tokens\": 148736, \"completion_tokens\": 3370, \"successful_requests\": 11}}]"}

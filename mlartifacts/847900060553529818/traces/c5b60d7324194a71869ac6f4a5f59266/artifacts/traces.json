The flu is distinguished from the \\\"stomach flu,\\\" which is a gastrointestinal illness, and varies in severity from mild to potentially life-threatening diseases.\\n\\n### **Symptoms of Influenza:**\\nFlu symptoms typically occur suddenly and can include:\\n- Fever and chills\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Muscle or body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Fatigue (tiredness)\\n- Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\nSymptoms may differ in severity and some people might experience all symptoms, while others may have only a few.\\n\\n### **Causes of Influenza:**\\nInfluenza is caused by various influenza viruses, with types A and B responsible for seasonal flu epidemics. The virus spreads mainly through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.\\n\\n### **Risk Factors:**\\nCertain individuals are at a greater risk of developing serious complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially younger than 5 years)\\n- Adults aged 65 and older\\n- Pregnant individuals\\n- Anyone with chronic health issues (diabetes, asthma, heart disease)\\n- Immunocompromised individuals\\n\\n### **Complications:**\\nPotential complications of the flu can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Sinus infections\\n- Worsening of chronic health conditions\\n\\nIn severe cases, hospitalization or even death can occur, particularly in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n### **Diagnosis:**\\nThe diagnosis of the flu typically involves a healthcare provider evaluating medical history and symptoms, often accompanied by diagnostic tests, such as swabs taken from the nasal passage to detect the virus.\\n\\n### **Treatment:**\\nTreatment strategies may include:\\n- Antiviral medications (e.g., Oseltamivir [Tamiflu], Zanamivir, Peramivir), particularly if started within 48 hours of symptom onset.\\n- Over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms (e.g., pain relievers, decongestants).\\n- Home care through rest and increased fluid intake.\\n\\n### **Prevention:**\\nPrevention methods include:\\n- **Vaccination:** Annual flu vaccines are recommended for most people over the age of 6 months.\\n- **Hygiene Practices:** Regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when symptomatic.\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes, and disinfecting commonly-touched surfaces.\\n\\n### **Mortality and Morbidity:**\\nOn average, seasonal flu can lead to tens of thousands of deaths annually in the U.S. alone. Vaccination significantly helps reduce the risk of severe complications.\\n\\n### **Conclusion:**\\nInfluenza remains a significant public health concern that requires attention, particularly among at-risk populations. Annual vaccinations, coupled with effective hygiene practices, provide the best defense against this contagious virus.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\\n- Mayo Clinic\\n- Cleveland Clinic\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Influenza (Flu) Senior Data Researcher\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_1", "context": {"span_id": "0xb0d6b036521d8f22", "trace_id": "0x0fa45aa3efd514c07798b53a79543b62"}, "parent_id": "0x74ec63f2dd7eef69", "start_time": 1742647412663067309, "end_time": 1742647429327233195, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"c5b60d7324194a71869ac6f4a5f59266\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"\", \"tools\": [{\"name\": \"Search the internet with Serper\", \"description\": \"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours.

The flu and COVID-19 can be severe, but colds rarely are. What is the flu (influenza)? The flu is an illness you get from the influenza virus. It causes symptoms like head and body aches, sore throat, fever and respiratory symptoms, which can be severe. Flu is most common in winter months, when many people can get sick at once (an epidemic). Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy When is flu season? Flu season — when cases of the flu go up dramatically — in the Northern Hemisphere (which includes the U.S.) is October through May. The highest number of cases (peak) usually happen between December and February. How common is the flu? The flu is one of the most common infectious diseases . Every flu season, about 20 to 40 million people in the U.S. catch the flu. What is the difference between the flu and the common cold? The flu and the common cold can have similar symptoms, like runny nose and cough. But cold symptoms are usually mild and flu symptoms can be severe and lead to serious complications. Different viruses cause colds and the flu. How do I know if I have the flu or COVID-19? Since they have similar symptoms, the only way to know for sure if you have the flu or COVID-19 is to get tested. They both have a risk of serious illness. But different viruses cause these infections, and providers treat them with different medications. Who is at higher risk for complications from the flu? Certain health conditions can put you at higher risk for severe illness from the flu. This includes life-threatening complications that require hospitalization. You’re at higher risk for serious illness if you: Have asthma , COPD or another chronic lung disease. Have a history of kidney, liver, neurological, heart or blood vessels disease, including stroke . Have a condition that causes issues with muscle function or makes it difficult to cough, swallow or clear fluids from your airways. Have diabetes . Have a weakened immune system (from HIV/AIDS , cancer or immunosuppressive medications ). Have a blood disorder, like sickle cell disease . Have a BMI greater than 30 (have obesity). Are under 5 years old or over 65 years old. Are pregnant. Are under 19 years old and take aspirin regularly. Live in a long-term care facility. Advertisement Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic American Indians, Alaska Native people and Hispanic or Latino people have the highest rates of severe illness from the flu compared to non-Hispanic White people and non-Hispanic Asian people. Symptoms and Causes With so many symptoms in common, it can be hard to tell the difference between a cold and the flu. Here’s how to tell which is which. What are the symptoms of the flu? Symptoms of the flu usually come on quickly, and can include: Fever . Chills . Body aches. Cough . Headache . Sore throat . Runny or stuffy nose ( congestion ). Tiredness or feeling run down. Diarrhea or vomiting (usually only in kids). You may not have all of these symptoms. What causes the flu? The influenza virus causes flu. Influenza A, B and C are the most common types that infect people. Influenza A and B are seasonal (most people get them in the winter) and have more severe symptoms. Influenza C doesn’t cause severe symptoms and it’s not seasonal — the number of cases stays about the same throughout the year. H1N1 (“swine flu”) and bird flu are both subtypes of influenza A. Is the flu contagious? Yes, the flu is contagious (it spreads from person to person). For every person infected, they spread the flu to one to two more people. How does the flu spread? The influenza virus spreads from direct or indirect contact with someone else who’s infected. Common ways to get the flu include: From someone nearby coughing, sneezing or talking. Droplets can either get onto your hands or move through the air to get into your nose or mouth. The flu then moves into your lungs. By touching a surface that’s contaminated by the flu virus, then touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. This includes things like door knobs, desks, computers and phones. By touching the hands or face of someone who has the flu, then touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. How long after exposure will I get the flu? If infected, you’ll usually get symptoms of the flu one to four days after exposure (incubation period). Diagnosis and Tests How is the flu diagnosed? Your provider diagnoses the flu by listening to your symptoms and testing a sample of mucus from your nose. They’ll put a long stick with a soft tip (swab) in your nose to test for influenza . Results may take a few minutes or your provider may send the sample to a lab, where you’ll get results in a day or two. Management and Treatment How is the flu treated? Providers can treat the flu with antiviral medications under certain circumstances. Antivirals can reduce your risk of severe illness and shorten the amount of time you’re sick. Many people can treat the flu without prescription medications. Providers prescribe antivirals if you: Have had symptoms for under 48 hours. Antivirals are less likely to work if you start them after two days of symptoms. The virus has already made more copies of itself and your body has started to fight it off with its own antibodies . Have an underlying condition or are at risk for severe illness. Providers may prescribe antivirals even if you’ve had symptoms for longer than 48 hours. Have severe symptoms, even if you’ve been sick for longer than 48 hours. Live with or care for people who are at risk for severe complications of the flu. Advertisement What medications treat the flu? Antiviral drugs for influenza include: Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®). You take oseltamivir by mouth as a pill or a liquid. You usually take it for several days. Zanamivir (Relenza®). You breathe zanamivir in through your mouth with an inhaler . You usually have to take it for several days. Zanamivir isn’t recommended for people with breathing issues, like asthma or COPD. Peramivir (Rapivap®). Your provider gives you peramivir directly into your veins using an IV. You usually only need one dose of peramivir. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). You take baloxavir marboxil by mouth as a pill or a liquid. You only take one dose. Baloxavir isn’t recommended if you’re pregnant, breastfeeding, hospitalized or have certain medical conditions. Tell your provider about any health conditions you have before starting an antiviral medication. Side effects of treatment Each antiviral medication has different side effects, but common ones include nausea and diarrhea. Inhaled medications can cause spasms that tighten and narrow your airways ( bronchospasm ). How do I manage symptoms of the flu? Many people can manage the symptoms of flu at home with over-the-counter (OTC) medications and other therapies, including: Getting plenty of rest. Drinking fluids like water or broth to help prevent dehydration. Applying heat packs or hot water bottles can help with aching muscles. Taking acetaminophen (Tylenol®) or NSAIDs (Advil®, Motrin®, Aleve®) can help lower your fever and relieve head and body aches. Using spray or oral decongestants like phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine can help with a runny or stuffy nose. Taking cough suppressants (antitussives) like dextromethorphan can help calm a nagging cough. Using expectorants like guaifenesin make it easier to clear mucus out of your lungs. Advertisement Not everyone should take certain OTCs, so check with your provider before you use them. It’s also a good idea to make sure certain medications are okay to use together or with supplements. Don’t give aspirin to children under the age of 16 unless their provider says it’s okay. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention How can I prevent the flu? The best way to reduce your risk is to get the flu vaccine yearly. You can get it as a shot or a mist sprayed into your nose. The influenza virus can change (mutate) over time, so you need to get vaccinated every year. Other ways to reduce your risk of getting the flu include: Wash your hands often with soap and water. If you can’t use soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough. Cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue rather than your bare hand. Avoid being around other people when you or they are sick with the flu or other infectious diseases. Consider wearing a mask if you’re sick and can’t avoid being around others. Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose and mouth. Don’t share food or eating utensils (forks, spoons, cups) with others. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have the flu? Most people are able to manage flu symptoms at home and recover within a few days to a week. Because it can cause severe illness, it’s important to keep an eye on your symptoms and get medical attention if you need it. This is especially important if you have an underlying health condition. Advertisement If you’re sick with the flu, you should avoid being around others, except to seek medical care. How long does the flu last? Flu can last from a few days to two weeks. Symptoms like fever and body aches can come on suddenly but usually go away faster than other symptoms. A cough or runny nose can last longer. How long is the flu contagious? You can be contagious with the flu from a day before your symptoms start to up to a week after. You’re most contagious for three to four days after your symptoms start. People with weakened immune systems and infants may be contagious for longer. When can I go back to work/school? To avoid spreading the flu to others, you shouldn’t go back to work or school until it’s been at least 24 hours since you’ve had a fever (without taking fever-reducing medications). Your employer or school may have different requirements for returning. Complications The flu virus itself can cause complications or it can weaken your immune system and allow bacteria to infect different parts of your body (secondary infection). Complications and secondary infections include: Ear infections . Sinus infections . Severe lung infection ( pneumonia ). Pneumonia can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening conditions. Pregnancy loss (miscarriage) . Neural tube defects (NTDs) in the developing fetus of a pregnant woman. How many people die from the flu each year? In a typical flu season in the U.S., it’s estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 people die from the flu. Another 300,000 to 500,000 require hospitalization for serious illness. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? If you think you have the flu, it’s important to get tested early on so that antiviral medications are most effective if your provider prescribes them. Contact a healthcare provider right away if: You have flu symptoms and an underlying condition that puts you at higher risk for severe illness. Your symptoms don’t start to improve after seven to 10 days or if you have a fever lasting longer than three days. You’re pregnant and have a fever or other flu symptoms. When should I go to ER? Go to the ER or seek immediate medical attention if you have symptoms of severe illness, including: High fever (over 103 F/40 C). Difficulty breathing. Not peeing or peeing very little. Pain in your chest or stomach (abdomen) that doesn’t go away. Persistent dizziness. Confusion. Severe muscle pain or weakness. Seizures . Bluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis, which can be a sign of low oxygen levels in your blood or tissues ). Fever or cough that gets better or goes away but then get worse. Worsening of other health conditions. What questions should I ask my doctor? How do I take my medication? What over-the-counter medications can I use? How do I treat my symptoms at home? What severe symptoms should I look out for? When should I go to the ER? When should I follow up with you? How long might it take to feel better? Additional Common Questions Is the stomach flu influenza? No, gastroenteritis, commonly called “stomach flu,” isn’t caused by the influenza virus. It’s not related to the seasonal flu. A note from Cleveland Clinic While the flu is very common, it’s also important to remember that it can lead to life-threatening complications. Getting your flu shot is the best way to avoid getting sick and protect your loved ones and neighbors, too. If you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant, talk to your provider about reducing your risk of flu. Having the flu isn’t fun for anyone, but most people can get through with some movies and chicken soup at home.

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu and COVID-19 can be severe, but colds rarely are. What is the flu (influenza)? The flu is an illness you get from the influenza virus. It causes symptoms like head and body aches, sore throat, fever and respiratory symptoms, which can be severe. Flu is most common in winter months, when many people can get sick at once (an epidemic). Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Flu season — when cases of the flu go up dramatically — in the Northern Hemisphere (which includes the U.S.) is October through May. The highest number of cases (peak) usually happen between December and February. How common is the flu? The flu is one of the most common infectious diseases . Every flu season, about 20 to 40 million people in the U.S. catch the flu. What is the difference between the flu and the common cold? The flu and the common cold can have similar symptoms, like runny nose and cough. But cold symptoms are usually mild and flu symptoms can be severe and lead to serious complications. Different viruses cause colds and the flu. How do I know if I have the flu or COVID-19? Since they have similar symptoms, the only way to know for sure if you have the flu or COVID-19 is to get tested. They both have a risk of serious illness. But different viruses cause these infections, and providers treat them with different medications. Who is at higher risk for complications from the flu? Certain health conditions can put you at higher risk for severe illness from the flu. This includes life-threatening complications that require hospitalization. You’re at higher risk for serious illness if you: Have asthma , COPD or another chronic lung disease. Have a history of kidney, liver, neurological, heart or blood vessels disease, including stroke . Have a condition that causes issues with muscle function or makes it difficult to cough, swallow or clear fluids from your airways. Have diabetes . Have a weakened immune system (from HIV/AIDS , cancer or immunosuppressive medications ). Have a blood disorder, like sickle cell disease . Have a BMI greater than 30 (have obesity). Are under 5 years old or over 65 years old. Are pregnant. Are under 19 years old and take aspirin regularly. Live in a long-term care facility. Advertisement Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic American Indians, Alaska Native people and Hispanic or Latino people have the highest rates of severe illness from the flu compared to non-Hispanic White people and non-Hispanic Asian people. Symptoms and Causes With so many symptoms in common, it can be hard to tell the difference between a cold and the flu. Here’s how to tell which is which. What are the symptoms of the flu? Symptoms of the flu usually come on quickly, and can include: Fever . Chills . Body aches. Cough . Headache . Sore throat . Runny or stuffy nose ( congestion ). Tiredness or feeling run down. Diarrhea or vomiting (usually only in kids). You may not have all of these symptoms. What causes the flu? The influenza virus causes flu. Influenza A, B and C are the most common types that infect people. Influenza A and B are seasonal (most people get them in the winter) and have more severe symptoms. Influenza C doesn’t cause severe symptoms and it’s not seasonal — the number of cases stays about the same throughout the year. H1N1 (“swine flu”) and bird flu are both subtypes of influenza A. Is the flu contagious? Yes, the flu is contagious (it spreads from person to person). For every person infected, they spread the flu to one to two more people. How does the flu spread? The influenza virus spreads from direct or indirect contact with someone else who’s infected. Common ways to get the flu include: From someone nearby coughing, sneezing or talking. Droplets can either get onto your hands or move through the air to get into your nose or mouth. The flu then moves into your lungs. By touching a surface that’s contaminated by the flu virus, then touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. This includes things like door knobs, desks, computers and phones. By touching the hands or face of someone who has the flu, then touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. How long after exposure will I get the flu? If infected, you’ll usually get symptoms of the flu one to four days after exposure (incubation period). Diagnosis and Tests How is the flu diagnosed? Your provider diagnoses the flu by listening to your symptoms and testing a sample of mucus from your nose. They’ll put a long stick with a soft tip (swab) in your nose to test for influenza . Results may take a few minutes or your provider may send the sample to a lab, where you’ll get results in a day or two. Management and Treatment How is the flu treated? Providers can treat the flu with antiviral medications under certain circumstances. Antivirals can reduce your risk of severe illness and shorten the amount of time you’re sick. Many people can treat the flu without prescription medications. Providers prescribe antivirals if you: Have had symptoms for under 48 hours. Antivirals are less likely to work if you start them after two days of symptoms. The virus has already made more copies of itself and your body has started to fight it off with its own antibodies . Have an underlying condition or are at risk for severe illness. Providers may prescribe antivirals even if you’ve had symptoms for longer than 48 hours. Have severe symptoms, even if you’ve been sick for longer than 48 hours. Live with or care for people who are at risk for severe complications of the flu. Advertisement What medications treat the flu? Antiviral drugs for influenza include: Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®). You take oseltamivir by mouth as a pill or a liquid. You usually take it for several days. Zanamivir (Relenza®). You breathe zanamivir in through your mouth with an inhaler . You usually have to take it for several days. Zanamivir isn’t recommended for people with breathing issues, like asthma or COPD. Peramivir (Rapivap®). Your provider gives you peramivir directly into your veins using an IV. You usually only need one dose of peramivir. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). You take baloxavir marboxil by mouth as a pill or a liquid. You only take one dose. Baloxavir isn’t recommended if you’re pregnant, breastfeeding, hospitalized or have certain medical conditions. Tell your provider about any health conditions you have before starting an antiviral medication. Side effects of treatment Each antiviral medication has different side effects, but common ones include nausea and diarrhea. Inhaled medications can cause spasms that tighten and narrow your airways ( bronchospasm ). How do I manage symptoms of the flu? Many people can manage the symptoms of flu at home with over-the-counter (OTC) medications and other therapies, including: Getting plenty of rest. Drinking fluids like water or broth to help prevent dehydration. Applying heat packs or hot water bottles can help with aching muscles. Taking acetaminophen (Tylenol®) or NSAIDs (Advil®, Motrin®, Aleve®) can help lower your fever and relieve head and body aches. Using spray or oral decongestants like phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine can help with a runny or stuffy nose. Taking cough suppressants (antitussives) like dextromethorphan can help calm a nagging cough. Using expectorants like guaifenesin make it easier to clear mucus out of your lungs. Advertisement Not everyone should take certain OTCs, so check with your provider before you use them. It’s also a good idea to make sure certain medications are okay to use together or with supplements. Don’t give aspirin to children under the age of 16 unless their provider says it’s okay. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention How can I prevent the flu? The best way to reduce your risk is to get the flu vaccine yearly. You can get it as a shot or a mist sprayed into your nose. The influenza virus can change (mutate) over time, so you need to get vaccinated every year. Other ways to reduce your risk of getting the flu include: Wash your hands often with soap and water. If you can’t use soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough. Cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue rather than your bare hand. Avoid being around other people when you or they are sick with the flu or other infectious diseases. Consider wearing a mask if you’re sick and can’t avoid being around others. Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose and mouth. Don’t share food or eating utensils (forks, spoons, cups) with others. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have the flu? Most people are able to manage flu symptoms at home and recover within a few days to a week. Because it can cause severe illness, it’s important to keep an eye on your symptoms and get medical attention if you need it. This is especially important if you have an underlying health condition. Advertisement If you’re sick with the flu, you should avoid being around others, except to seek medical care. How long does the flu last? Flu can last from a few days to two weeks. Symptoms like fever and body aches can come on suddenly but usually go away faster than other symptoms. A cough or runny nose can last longer. How long is the flu contagious? You can be contagious with the flu from a day before your symptoms start to up to a week after. You’re most contagious for three to four days after your symptoms start. People with weakened immune systems and infants may be contagious for longer. When can I go back to work/school? To avoid spreading the flu to others, you shouldn’t go back to work or school until it’s been at least 24 hours since you’ve had a fever (without taking fever-reducing medications). Your employer or school may have different requirements for returning. Complications The flu virus itself can cause complications or it can weaken your immune system and allow bacteria to infect different parts of your body (secondary infection). Complications and secondary infections include: Ear infections . Sinus infections . Severe lung infection ( pneumonia ). Pneumonia can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening conditions. Pregnancy loss (miscarriage) . Neural tube defects (NTDs) in the developing fetus of a pregnant woman. How many people die from the flu each year? In a typical flu season in the U.S., it’s estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 people die from the flu. Another 300,000 to 500,000 require hospitalization for serious illness. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? If you think you have the flu, it’s important to get tested early on so that antiviral medications are most effective if your provider prescribes them. Contact a healthcare provider right away if: You have flu symptoms and an underlying condition that puts you at higher risk for severe illness. Your symptoms don’t start to improve after seven to 10 days or if you have a fever lasting longer than three days. You’re pregnant and have a fever or other flu symptoms. When should I go to ER? Go to the ER or seek immediate medical attention if you have symptoms of severe illness, including: High fever (over 103 F/40 C). Difficulty breathing. Not peeing or peeing very little. Pain in your chest or stomach (abdomen) that doesn’t go away. Persistent dizziness. Confusion. Severe muscle pain or weakness. Seizures . Bluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis, which can be a sign of low oxygen levels in your blood or tissues ). Fever or cough that gets better or goes away but then get worse. Worsening of other health conditions. What questions should I ask my doctor? How do I take my medication? What over-the-counter medications can I use? How do I treat my symptoms at home? What severe symptoms should I look out for? When should I go to the ER? When should I follow up with you? How long might it take to feel better? Additional Common Questions Is the stomach flu influenza? No, gastroenteritis, commonly called “stomach flu,” isn’t caused by the influenza virus. It’s not related to the seasonal flu. A note from Cleveland Clinic While the flu is very common, it’s also important to remember that it can lead to life-threatening complications. Getting your flu shot is the best way to avoid getting sick and protect your loved ones and neighbors, too. If you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant, talk to your provider about reducing your risk of flu. Having the flu isn’t fun for anyone, but most people can get through with some movies and chicken soup at home.

While often confused with the \\\"stomach flu,\\\" influenza is distinct and can range in severity from mild to potentially life-threatening. The flu remains a significant public health concern, particularly during seasonal epidemics, affecting millions globally.\\n\\n## **Symptoms of Influenza**\\nFlu symptoms typically manifest suddenly and encompass a range of indicators, including:\\n- **Fever and chills**: Commonly experienced, although some individuals may not exhibit a fever.\\n- **Cough**: Often a dry cough that may worsen.\\n- **Sore throat**: A common complaint that can cause discomfort.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: Nasal congestion is frequently reported.\\n- **Muscle or body aches**: Generalized pain is typical.\\n- **Headaches**: Can vary in intensity but is a common symptom.\\n- **Fatigue (tiredness)**: A persistent feeling of exhaustion that can last for weeks.\\n- **Vomiting and diarrhea**: More prevalent in children, these gastrointestinal symptoms can accompany the flu.\\n\\nIndividuals may experience varying combinations of these symptoms, with some only suffering mild discomfort, while others can suffer severely.\\n\\n## **Causes of Influenza**\\nInfluenza is primarily caused by types A and B virus subtypes, which account for seasonal flu epidemics. The virus spreads easily through:\\n- **Respiratory droplets**: Transmitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.\\n- **Contaminated surfaces**: Touching surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus and then touching the face can lead to infection.\\n\\n## **Risk Factors**\\nCertain groups are at heightened risk for severe complications from the flu, including:\\n- **Young children**: Especially those under the age of 5.\\n- **Adults aged 65 and older**: This demographic often experiences more severe health issues.\\n- **Pregnant individuals**: They are more susceptible to complications.\\n- **Chronic health conditions**: Such as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease can exacerbate flu symptoms.\\n- **Immunocompromised individuals**: Those with weakened immune systems are at greater risk.\\n\\n## **Complications**\\nPotential complications from flu may include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: A severe lung infection that can be life-threatening.\\n- **Bronchitis**: Inflammation of the bronchial tubes can occur.\\n- **Sinus infections**: Bacterial infections may develop as a secondary complication.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health conditions**: Pre-existing conditions can deteriorate due to the flu.\\n\\nIn severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary, and flu-related deaths occur, particularly among the high-risk population.\\n\\n## **Diagnosis**\\nDiagnosing influenza involves:\\n- **Medical history and symptoms evaluation**: A healthcare provider reviews symptoms and may ask about exposure to others who have flu-like symptoms.\\n- **Diagnostic tests**: Such as rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) or PCR tests which confirm the presence of flu viruses.\\n\\n## **Treatment**\\nTreatment for influenza may include:\\n- **Antiviral medications**: Such as Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Peramivir, which are most effective when initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset.\\n- **Symptomatic relief**: Over-the-counter medications for fever and pain relief can alleviate discomfort.\\n- **Home care**: Increased hydration and rest are recommended, helping the body recover from the illness.\\n\\n## **Prevention**\\nPreventative measures against influenza include:\\n- **Vaccination**: Annual flu vaccines are essential for most individuals over six months old.\\n- **Hygiene practices**: Regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when symptomatic can mitigate spread.\\n- **Respiratory etiquette**: Covering coughs and sneezes and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces play a critical role in prevention.\\n\\n## **Mortality and Morbidity**\\nAccording to continuous surveillance, seasonal influenza can result in tens of thousands of deaths annually within the U.S. Vaccination has proven effective in dramatically reducing instances of severe complications.\\n\\n## **Seasonal Severity Assessment**\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies the severity of each flu season. For the 2023-2024 season, the influenza activity is classified as moderately severe, drawing comparisons to pre-COVID-19 seasons. Recent fluctuations in peak activity have seen notable increases in hospitalization rates and mortality statistics.\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\nInfluenza continues to pose a substantial public health challenge, particularly for vulnerable populations. The combination of annual vaccinations and adherence to recommended hygiene practices offers the most effective defense against this prevalent virus.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\\n- World Health Organization (WHO)\\n- Mayo Clinic\\n- Cleveland Clinic\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Influenza (Flu) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_2", "context": {"span_id": "0x8a9cd0a061ee5761", "trace_id": "0x0fa45aa3efd514c07798b53a79543b62"}, "parent_id": "0xe3dd91ca85ec0cf8", "start_time": 1742647429341553963, "end_time": 1742647465180930012, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"c5b60d7324194a71869ac6f4a5f59266\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"**Influenza (Flu) Overview:**\\n\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect the nose, throat, and lungs.

The flu is distinguished from the \\\"stomach flu,\\\" which is a gastrointestinal illness, and varies in severity from mild to potentially life-threatening diseases.\\n\\n### **Symptoms of Influenza:**\\nFlu symptoms typically occur suddenly and can include:\\n- Fever and chills\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Muscle or body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Fatigue (tiredness)\\n- Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\nSymptoms may differ in severity and some people might experience all symptoms, while others may have only a few.\\n\\n### **Causes of Influenza:**\\nInfluenza is caused by various influenza viruses, with types A and B responsible for seasonal flu epidemics. The virus spreads mainly through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.\\n\\n### **Risk Factors:**\\nCertain individuals are at a greater risk of developing serious complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially younger than 5 years)\\n- Adults aged 65 and older\\n- Pregnant individuals\\n- Anyone with chronic health issues (diabetes, asthma, heart disease)\\n- Immunocompromised individuals\\n\\n### **Complications:**\\nPotential complications of the flu can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Sinus infections\\n- Worsening of chronic health conditions\\n\\nIn severe cases, hospitalization or even death can occur, particularly in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n### **Diagnosis:**\\nThe diagnosis of the flu typically involves a healthcare provider evaluating medical history and symptoms, often accompanied by diagnostic tests, such as swabs taken from the nasal passage to detect the virus.\\n\\n### **Treatment:**\\nTreatment strategies may include:\\n- Antiviral medications (e.g., Oseltamivir [Tamiflu], Zanamivir, Peramivir), particularly if started within 48 hours of symptom onset.\\n- Over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms (e.g., pain relievers, decongestants).\\n- Home care through rest and increased fluid intake.\\n\\n### **Prevention:**\\nPrevention methods include:\\n- **Vaccination:** Annual flu vaccines are recommended for most people over the age of 6 months.\\n- **Hygiene Practices:** Regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when symptomatic.\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes, and disinfecting commonly-touched surfaces.\\n\\n### **Mortality and Morbidity:**\\nOn average, seasonal flu can lead to tens of thousands of deaths annually in the U.S. alone. Vaccination significantly helps reduce the risk of severe complications.\\n\\n### **Conclusion:**\\nInfluenza remains a significant public health concern that requires attention, particularly among at-risk populations. Annual vaccinations, coupled with effective hygiene practices, provide the best defense against this contagious virus.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\\n- Mayo Clinic\\n- Cleveland Clinic\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

Influenza activity in the United States during the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024) was moderately severe and within the range seen during pre-COVID-19 seasons for both timing and intensity of activity. During the 2023–2024 season, influenza activity began to increase in early November and peaked in late December 2023. Activity declined for a few weeks in January 2024 and then remained relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 before declining to inter-seasonal levels in May 2024. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus circulating during the 2023–2024 season. However, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses later in the season as overall influenza activity began to decrease. This is the third season in a row without influenza B/Yamagata viruses in circulation.\\nThis report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024) as reported to CDC through its collaborative efforts with clinical and public health laboratories, outpatient providers, emergency departments, hospitals, vital statistics offices, and public health departments. It also includes the composition of the Northern Hemisphere 2024–2025 influenza vaccines and a brief update on influenza activity occurring during the summer of 2024 in the Southern Hemisphere.\\nVirus Surveillance\\nThe influenza virologic surveillance system is comprised of the U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating laboratories and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories, which include both clinical and public health laboratories throughout the United States. Clinical laboratories primarily test for diagnostic purposes and their data are used to understand timing and intensity of influenza activity, while public health laboratories primarily test specimens for influenza for surveillance purposes to understand what influenza virus subtypes and lineages are circulating and the ages of people that are infected 1 . During the 2023–2024 influenza season, clinical laboratories reporting to CDC tested 3,910,204 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses using clinical diagnostic tests. Among these, 351,460 (9.0%) specimens tested positive, including 243,048 (69.2%) for influenza A and 108,401 (30.8%) for influenza B viruses. The overall percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza nationally each week ranged from 0.4% to 18.3% and peaked during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) before declining slightly and remaining relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 (Figure 1). The timing of peak activity for influenza A and influenza B varied (late December and late February, respectively) which contributed to the sustained period of elevated activity overall.\\nBased on the percentage of specimens testing positive in clinical laboratories, peak influenza activity in the 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions occurred between mid-December 2023 and late February 2024: HHS Regions 9 and 10 (West Coast and Pacific Northwest) peaked in mid-December; Regions 2, 3, 4, and 8 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Mountain) peaked in late December; Region 6 (South Central) peaked late in January; Region 1 (New England) peaked in early February; and Regions 5 and 7 (Midwest and Central) peaked late in February.\\nFigure 1.

Among 25,906 seasonal influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 16,875 (65.1%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 9,031 (34.9%) were influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Influenza B lineage information was available for 8,010 (87.1%) influenza B viruses, with all of them belonging to the Victoria lineage (Figure 2). No influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses have been identified worldwide since March 2020.\\nFigure 2. Influenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories*, National Summary, 2023–2024 Season\\nView Larger\\nInfluenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories*, National Summary, 2023–2024 Season\\n*This graph reflects the number of specimens tested and the number determined to be positive for influenza viruses at the public health lab (specimens tested is not the same as cases). It does not reflect specimens tested only at CDC and could include more than one specimen tested per person. Specimens tested as part of routine influenza surveillance as well as those tested as part of targeted testing for people exposed to influenza A(H5) are included. The guidance for influenza A/H5 testing recommends testing both a conjunctival and respiratory swab for people with conjunctivitis which has resulted in more specimens testing positive for influenza A/H5 than the number of human H5 cases. For more information on the number of people infected with A/H5, please visit the \\\" How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation \\\"\\nNationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus during the 2023–2024 influenza season as a whole and for each week from early November 2023 through the end of February 2024. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses co-circulated at lower levels during that time. However, as overall influenza activity decreased, A(H3N2) or B viruses were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. The co-circulation of these strains likely contributed to extending the duration of the season, with A(H3N2) and B viruses increasing as A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses decreased and A(H3N2) viruses taking over as the predominant virus in early April 2024 (Figure 2). On a regional level, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant during the season as a whole in all 10 HHS regions; however, the extent and timing of A(H3N2) and B viruses varied by region. For additional regional level data, please visit FluView Interactive.\\nAmong the influenza A viruses that were subtyped, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common virus among all age groups comprising 68.8% of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses identified in persons aged 0–4 years, 63.8% in 5–24 years, 66.0% in 25–64 years, and 63.6% in those aged 65 years or older. However, the second most frequently identified virus varied by age group: influenza B in those 0–4 and 5–24 years old, influenza A(H3N2) in those 65 years and older and approximately equal proportions of influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses in those 25–64 years.\\nVirus Characterization & Antiviral Susceptibility\\nGenetic characterization of the viruses circulating during this time period was conducted using next generation sequencing, and the genomic data were analyzed and submitted to publicly accessible databases (GenBank: GenBank Overview and EpiFlu: Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2025 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season announced ). Phylogenies of representative subsets of genetic data from CDC and other submitters can be visualized in real time at Nextstrain .\\nTo evaluate whether genetic changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) of circulating viruses affected antigenicity, antigenic characterizations were conducted using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2 and B viruses) or High-content Imaging-based micro-Neutralization Test ( HINT ) (A(H3N2) viruses) and post-infection ferret antisera raised to reference viruses representing the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses. Both assays determine how well antibodies raised to the influenza vaccine reference viruses recognize or bind to circulating viruses. HI assay measures how well antibodies inhibit the binding between the HA of the virus and the sialic acid receptors on the surface of red blood cells, whereas HINT measures how well antibodies neutralize or block virus infection of a cell.\\nCDC genetically characterized 5,348 viruses (3,865 influenza A and 1,483 influenza B) collected in the United States during October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, and antigenically characterized viruses representing various genetic clades. Overall, the vaccine antigens for each of the three major groups of the influenza viruses circulating in people (i.e., A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria) elicited antibodies that reacted well with most of the co-circulating viruses during this period (Figure 3). Detailed characterization data for each group are bellow.\\nInfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09\\nPhylogenetic analysis of the HA demonstrated that all viruses tested belonged to the 6B.1A.5a lineage and were classified in 2 clades. Clade 5a.2a represented 24.4% (n=480), and 75.6% (n=1,491) were clade 5a.2a.1. The A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines contain HA genes from clade 5a.2a.1. Nearly all (99.8%, n=573) of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were well recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses which represent the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\\nInfluenza A(H3N2)\\nAll 1,894 genetically characterized A(H3N2) viruses belonged to subclades of the 3C.2a1b.2a clade, with the majority (99.8%, n=1,891) belonging to the 2a.3a.1 subclade. The A(H3N2) component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines contain HA genes from the 3C.2a1b.2a clade. Antigenic analysis showed that 629 (95.0%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI or HINT by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses that represent the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\\nInfluenza B\\nAll influenza B viruses for which characterization was possible belonged to the B/Victoria-lineage. Infections with B/Yamagata viruses have not been identified globally since March of 2020. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes showed that all (n=1,483) belonged to clade V1A.3a.2. The genetic clade of the B/Victoria-lineage component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines is this V1A.3a.2 clade.\\nFigure 3. Genetic Clades of HA genes Based on Phylogenic Analysis of Influenza Viruses Collected Since October 1, 2023\\nView Larger\\nGenetic Clades of HA genes Based on Phylogenic Analysis of Influenza Viruses Collected Since October 1, 2023\\nCDC also assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral medications. Between October 1, 2023, and August 31, 2024, a total of 5,163 viruses collected in the United States were characterized for susceptibility to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors using sequence-based analysis, and a subset of 478 viruses (9.3%) were tested using a functional assay. Based on sequence analysis, all viruses, except 10, lacked known or suspected mutations associated with reduced inhibition by the neuraminidase inhibitors. Of these 10 viruses, 5 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses contained an NA-H275Y amino acid substitution and 1 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had a combination of NA substitutions I223V + S247N. The remaining 4 viruses were from B/Victoria lineage; two of them had a new substitution NA-A245G; one had NA-D197N; and 1 virus had NA-H273Y substitution. All viruses lacking NA mutations displayed normal inhibition by the neuraminidase inhibitors. As expected, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses containing NA-H275Y showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with substitutions I223V + S247N showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Two B/Victoria viruses with NA-A245G showed reduced inhibition by peramivir. One B/Victoria virus with NA-D197N showed reduced inhibition by peramivir and zanamivir, while another B/Victoria virus with NA-H273Y showed highly reduced inhibition by peramivir.\\nA total of 5,069 viruses were characterized for susceptibility to the polymerase acidic (PA) cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using sequence-based analysis, and a subset of 585 viruses (11.5%) were tested phenotypically. All tested viruses were susceptible to baloxavir, except 1 A(H3N2) virus with a PA-I38T amino acid substitution, which showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.\\nTable 1.

The A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria lineage and B/Yamagata lineage components are unchanged from the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. Both the egg-based and cell- or recombinant-based vaccines had a change in the A(H3N2) component. In the egg-based vaccine it was changed to an A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus and in cell- or recombinant-based vaccines it was changed to an A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus 2 3 . The genetic clade and subclade for the recommended vaccine viruses were 5a.2a.1 for A(H1N1)pdm09, 3C.2a1b.2a.3a.1 for A(H3N2), V1A.3a.2 for B/Victoria, and Y3 for B/Yamagata.\\nDue to the lack of detections of circulating B/Yamagata lineage viruses worldwide after March 2020, FDA further recommended vaccines manufactured for the U.S. population for the 2024–2025 season be trivalent, including only one B component from the B/Victoria lineage 4 .\\nTable 2.

Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be understood, and appropriate public health measures can be taken 1 .\\nFrom October 1, 2023, through August 31, 2024, a total of 21 novel influenza A virus infections were reported to CDC (Figure 4). Of the 21 novel influenza A virus infections reported, 14 avian influenza A (H5) virus detections in people were reported from 4 states (1-TX, 2-MI,10-CO, 1-MO). Four of the 14 cases were associated with exposure to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 infected dairy cattle, 9 were associated with poultry culling operations, and one case did not have a determined source. All 14 cases occurred in adults, 13 reported mild illness, and one patient with underlying medical conditions was hospitalized at the time the specimen for influenza testing was collected. All have recovered from their illness. No human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A (H5) viruses was identified associated with these cases.\\nCurrently in the United States, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in wild birds, and there have been outbreaks among other animals including commercial poultry, backyard flocks, and dairy cows. Sporadic infections in wild mammals also have been reported by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 5 . The first detections of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in dairy cows and unpasteurized milk samples from cows in Texas and Kansas were reported by USDA on March 25, 2024. As of August 31, 2024, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in 201 dairy herds from 14 states. Since 2022, HPAI A(H5) virus has been detected in commercial and backyard flocks in 48 states and has impacted over 100 million birds 5 . Updates on surveillance activities and symptom monitoring among persons exposed to animals infected with H5N1 are available at: How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation .\\nCDC recommends that state and local public health departments monitor people who are exposed to birds or other animals (including livestock) suspected to be infected with avian influenza A viruses for signs and symptoms consistent with influenza virus infection until 10 days after their last exposure and that people who develop illness be tested for influenza and treated with antiviral medication if indicated 6 . During February 9, 2022 — August 31, 2024, over 14,100 people were monitored following exposure to HPAI A(H5N1) virus infected birds, cows, or other animals.\\nOf the 21 novel influenza A virus infections reported during the 2023–2024 season, 7 were confirmed to be variant viruses (i.e., a swine influenza virus identified in a human and designated with a \\\"v\\\"). One H1N1v (OH), 4 H1N2v (PA), and 2 H3N2v (1-CO, 1-MI) virus infections were detected and reported to CDC. Among the 7 individuals infected with variant influenza viruses, 6 had documented swine exposure prior to illness, and for one the investigation did not determine a source. Among the 7 cases, 4 were hospitalized, and all recovered from their illness. Three were children <18 years old, and 4 were adults. No human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses was identified associated with these cases.\\nFigure 4.

Nationally, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for ILI recorded in ILINet was at or above the national baseline of 2.9% for 22 consecutive weeks from late October 2023 to late March 2024 and peaked at 6.9% during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) (Figure 5). The timing and peak percentage of visits for ILI during the 2023–2024 season were within the range of what was reported during seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be attributable to respiratory virus circulation and healthcare seeking behavior that was more similar to pre-COVID seasons than what occurred during the 2020–2021, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023 seasons.\\nOn a regional level, 8 of 10 HHS regions reported ILI activity that peaked during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52); however, Region 6 (South Central) peaked during the week ending December 23, 2023 (week 51) and Region 7 (Central) peaked during the week ending February 24, 2024 (week 8). The number of weeks of elevated activity (weeks above the region-specific baseline) varied slightly by region: Region 1 (New England) was above baseline for 23 weeks; Regions 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 4 (Southeast), 5 (Midwest), 6 (South Central), and 7 (Central) were above baseline for 20-21 weeks; Regions 2 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands), 8 (Mountain) and 9 (Pacific) were above baseline for 17-18 weeks; and Region 10 (Pacific Northwest) was above baseline for 14 weeks. Multiple respiratory viruses co-circulated during the 2023–2024 season and the contribution of influenza viruses to ILI likely varied by week and location.\\nFigure 5.

Both pediatric age groups (0–4 years and 5–24 years) had a higher percentage of visits for ILI compared to the adult age groups throughout the season. Peak activity among those 5–24 years occurred during the week ending December 23, 2023, while activity in all other age groups occurred during the week ending December 30, 2023 (Figure 6).\\nFigure 6. Percentage of Outpatient Visits by Age Group for Respiratory Illness as Reported by ILINet — United States, October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024\\nView Larger\\nPercentage of Outpatient Visits by Age Group for Respiratory Illness as Reported by ILINet — United States, October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024\\nILINet data are used to produce weekly jurisdiction and core-based statistical area (CBSA)-level measures of ILI activity. From the 2008–2009 season through the 2018–2019 season ILI activity categories ranged from minimal to high; during the 2019–20 season the very high category was added 1 . For the weeks ending December 23, 2023–January 6, 2024, and February 10, 2024 (weeks 51-1, 6), more than 50% of the 55 jurisdictions experienced high or very high ILI activity each week, with the highest number (41; 74.5%) occurring during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52). This is similar to the peak weekly percentage of jurisdictions experiencing high of very high ILI activity during the past 2 seasons (2022–2023 [86%], 2021–2022 [58%]) and during the 2 seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019–20 [87.0%], 2018–2019 [59.3%]). For a weekly snapshot of geographic activity levels of ILI, please see FluView Interactive .\\nHospitalization Surveillance\\nCDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections through two surveillance systems: the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which covers approximately 9% of the U.S. population, and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance which consists of reports from all hospitals across the country (1).\\nFrom October 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024, a total of 25,390 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites. Hospitalization rates peaked nationally during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) at 8.9 per 100,000 population. This is the third highest weekly rate observed during all seasons going back to 2010–2011 (Figure 7). This season follows the 2017–2018 season which peaked at 10.2 per 100,000 during the week ending January 6, 2018 (week 1) and the 2014–2015 season which peaked at 9.0 per 100,000 during the week ending December 27, 2014 (week 52).\\nFigure 7.

Data from the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. Hospitalization rates are updated weekly as data becomes available.\\n**In 2021–2022, rates reflect cases hospitalized beginning October 1, 2021 (MMWR Week 39), but given late influenza season activity, the season was extended to June 11, 2022 (MMWR Week 23). In 2023–2024, surveillance was extended beyond April 30 for situational awareness during the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus among birds, poultry, dairy cattle, and other animals in the United States.\\nThe overall cumulative hospitalization rate through April 27, 2024 (to coincide with when FluSurv-NET surveillance typically ends) was 83.1 per 100,000 population. Since the 2009–2010 season, this is the second highest cumulative rate based, (Figure 8).\\nFigure 8. Cumulative Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations — United States, 2014–2015 to 2023–2024 influenza seasons\\nView Larger\\nCumulative Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations — United States, 2014–2015 to 2023–2024 influenza seasons\\n*In 2021–2022, rates reflect cases hospitalized beginning October 1, 2021 (MMWR Week 39), but given late influenza season activity, the season was extended to June 11, 2022 (MMWR Week 23). In 2023–2024, surveillance was extended beyond April 30 for situational awareness during the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus among birds, poultry, dairy cattle, and other animals in the United States. Because surveillance for the 2023–2024 season was extended, it is recommended to not compare the cumulative rate from this season to cumulative rates from past seasons in which surveillance ended earlier.\\nAmong 25,390 influenza-associated hospitalizations, most (84.6%) were associated with influenza A virus, with 14.8% associated with influenza B virus. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 67.6% were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 32.4% were A(H3N2).\\nWhen examining rates by age, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among adults aged ≥65 years (231.0), followed by adults aged 50–64 years (98.9), children aged 0–4 years (86.1), adults aged 18–49 years (40.2), and was lowest among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years (34.3) (Figure 9). When examining age-adjusted rates by race and ethnicity, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (149.5), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (120.4), Hispanic/Latino persons (85.9), non-Hispanic White persons (65.5), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (47.5).\\nFigure 9. Cumulative Rate of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations by Age — United States, 2023–2024 influenza season\\nView Larger\\nCumulative Rate of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations by Age — United States, 2023–2024 influenza season\\nAmong 5,990 adults with information on underlying medical conditions who were hospitalized between October 1, 2023, and April 30, 2024, 94.5% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and obesity. Among 1,980 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15–49 years) with information on pregnancy status, 21.7% were pregnant. Among 1,429 hospitalized children and adolescents with information about underlying conditions, 70.7% reported at least one underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were asthma, neurologic disease, and obesity.\\nReporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance Component, the second surveillance system that tracks hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections, was between October 1, 2023, and May 4, 2024. During that time, 229,442 influenza associated hospitalizations were reported yielding a cumulative national influenza associated hospitalization rate of 69.2 per 100,000 population for the season. Hospitalizations began to increase in early November, peaking nationally during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) at 20,534 hospitalizations (6.2 hospitalizations per 100,000 population) before declining slightly and remaining relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 (Figure 10). While the peak weekly number of hospitalizations during the 2023–2024 season (20,534) was slightly lower than the peak weekly number during the 2022–2023 season (25,882), the total number of hospitalizations was higher this season (229,442) than it was during the same time period of the 2022–2023 season (209,338) due to the extended period of elevated activity this season.\\nFigure 10.

Regions 1 (New England) and 6 (South Central) peaked one week later (the week ending January 6, 2024) and Region 7 (Central) peaked during the week ending March 2, 2024 (week 9). Hospitalization rates in Regions 1 (New England), 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 5 (Midwest), and 6 (South Central) had a bimodal distribution, with smaller secondary peaks occurring in early March 2024 following the initial peak in late December and early January 2024. On a regional level, cumulative hospitalization rates ranged from 39.7 to 82.7 per 100,000 with 7 regions reporting a cumulative rate greater than 70 per 100,000. For additional details, see FluView Interactive .\\nMortality Surveillance\\nAccording to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance System 1 , during October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, a total of 2,774,168 deaths from all causes were reported nationally. Among these, 10,289 (0.4%) had influenza listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death. The weekly percentage of deaths due to influenza ranged from 0.03% to 1.3% and peaked during the week ending January 6, 2024 (week 1) (Figure 11). Influenza deaths began to increase in late November 2023, peaking in early January 2024 (week 1), and then declined. This peak occurred later in the season compared to the 2022–2023 influenza season, which peaked at 1.6% during mid-December 2022; however, it was slightly earlier than recent pre-COVID influenza seasons, which peaked between late January 2018 (2017–2018 season) and mid-March 2016 (2015–2016 season). While the peak weekly percentage of deaths due to influenza was lower during this season compared to last, the cumulative percentage of deaths due to influenza was slightly higher (0.4% during 2023–2024 compared with 0.3% during 2022–2023) due to longer duration of elevated influenza-associated mortality.\\nFigure 11. Influenza Mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, 2019–20 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\nView Larger\\nInfluenza Mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, 2019–20 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\n*Data presented are current as of September 9, 2024.\\nCDC monitors influenza-associated deaths in children younger than 18 years of age through the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System 1 . During October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, a total of 197 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC (Figure 12); this is nearly equal to the highest number of deaths reported during a seasonal influenza epidemic (199 deaths reported during the 2019–2020 season). Since influenza-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of influenza-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 during the 2011–2012 season to 199 during the 2019–20 season. This season, 104 of the reported deaths were associated with influenza A viruses, 90 were associated with influenza B viruses, and 3 were associated with influenza A and B virus co-infection. Of 60 influenza A viruses with a reported subtype, 44 (73.3%) were influenza A (H1N1) and 16 (26.7%) were influenza A (H3N2). Fourteen deaths associated with influenza B viruses had a lineage reported, and all were B/Victoria lineage viruses. No pediatric deaths associated with influenza B/Yamagata have been reported since the 2017–2018 season. The mean age at death was 7 years (range = 4 weeks–17 years). Location of deaths were known for all children and adolescents; most (112 [56.9%]) died after hospital admission; 56 (28.4%) died in an emergency room; and 29 (14.7%) died outside of a hospital setting. Among the 187 children and adolescents with a known medical history, 93 (49.7%) had at least one underlying medical condition associated with higher risk for developing serious influenza-related complications 7 . Among the 157 children and adolescents who were eligible for influenza vaccination (age ≥6 months at date of illness onset) and for whom vaccination status was known, 130 (82.8%) were not fully vaccinated.\\nFigure 12. Number of Influenza-Associated Pediatric Deaths by Virus Type and Week of Death, 2020–2021 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\nView Larger\\nNumber of Influenza-Associated Pediatric Deaths by Virus Type and Week of Death, 2020–2021 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\n*Data shown are current as of September 9, 2024, and include deaths occurring until August 31, 2024. Additional pediatric deaths that occurred during this time period may continue to be reported as they are identified. The total number of deaths will be updated in FluView and on FluView Interactive as they are received.\\nInfluenza Disease Burden and Prevented Burden from Vaccination\\nCDC does not know the exact number of people who have been sick and affected by influenza viruses because influenza virus infection is not a reportable disease in most areas of the United States. However, CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the number of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occur each season 8 . Preliminary end of season estimates of influenza disease burden in the United States for the 2023–2024 season, from October 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024, show that influenza virus infection likely resulted in between 34 million–75 million symptomatic illnesses, 15 million-33 million medical visits, 380,000-900,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000-100,000 deaths. Older adults (≥65 years) accounted for 51% of hospitalizations and 68% of deaths.\\nIn addition to estimating the disease burden, CDC also estimates the benefit of influenza vaccination by calculating the number of illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that are prevented by vaccination. CDC uses a compartmental model to estimate the burden that would have occurred without vaccination and the burden that occurred with vaccination 8 . The difference between these two estimates is the vaccine prevented burden. During the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – April 30, 2024), influenza vaccine coverage ranged from 37% among those 18–49 years to 73% among older adults ≥65 years (FluVaxView: Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard ) Influenza vaccine effectiveness in outpatient settings ranged from 34% to 64% depending on age group 9 . For the 2023–2024 season, CDC preliminarily estimates that influenza vaccination prevented between 7.4 million-15 million symptomatic illnesses, 3.6 million-7.4 million medical visits, 100,000-240,000 hospitalizations, and 3,500-34,000) deaths.\\nBoth disease and prevented burden will be updated later in the calendar year and updated estimates will be posted to the CDC websites for disease burden and averted burden.\\nSeasonal Severity Assessment\\nEach season, CDC classifies influenza season severity at the end of each season using influenza virus activity data, including influenza-like illness, influenza hospitalization rates, and influenza deaths to compare to the same data from past seasons and to classify the severity of the influenza season 10 . Severity is classified across all age groups and for children, adults, and older adults. The severity of the 2023–2024 season was classified as moderately severe across all age groups and for children, adults, and older adults.\\nInfluenza Activity in the Southern Hemisphere\\nInfluenza follows a seasonal pattern in Southern Hemisphere countries, with activity usually occurring between April and September and sometimes lasting until October or November. Based on data collected and submitted by countries to the World Health Organization's FluNet system 11 , as of late-August 2024, influenza activity peaked and is declining in most Southern Hemisphere countries in South America, while activity in countries in Southern Africa and Oceania persists. In South America and Australia (which provides most of the data for the Oceania region), most influenza virus detections reported this season have been influenza A(H3N2) viruses, except in Ecuador where influenza B predominated. In Southern Africa, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have predominated, though influenza B detections have increased in recent weeks.\\nIn comparison to seasonal influenza trends observed before the COVID-19 pandemic, three South American countries—Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay—reported data suggesting an earlier start to their 2024 influenza seasons while the remaining countries reported timing of activity similar to what was observed before the COVID-19 pandemic. Most countries in South America, Southern Africa, and Oceania have had influenza activity reach moderate levels, in line with levels observed in prior seasons, though two countries experienced very high influenza virus detection levels: Chile and Zambia driven by circulation of A(H3N2) and co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses, respectively. Influenza virus detections among individuals with severe acute respiratory infections (i.e., SARI cases, defined as a hospitalized case reporting a cough and fever, with symptom onset in the last 10 days) reached very high levels in Chile and Zambia, and high levels in Uruguay, Ecuador, and South Africa 12 13 .\\nOf note, Ghana, Senegal, and Lao People's Democratic Republic, which are tropical countries in the Northern Hemisphere, have reported higher levels of influenza detections than expected for this time of year compared to seasonal influenza trends observed before the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nDiscussion\\nThe 2023–2024 influenza season in the United States is considered moderately severe with an estimate of at least 34 million symptomatic illnesses, 15 million medical visits, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000 deaths caused by influenza virus infection. The predominant influenza virus overall during the 2023–2024 influenza season was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. However, as A(H1N1)pdm09 activity declined, A(H3N2) and B/Victoria virus activity continued to increase for several more weeks and, each were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from early March until mid-May. From June through August, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses co-circulated and influenza B viruses were reported in small numbers. Eight of the previous 25 seasons (1997–98 through 2022–2023, excluding the 2020–2021 season due to low influenza virus circulation), were characterized by A(H1N1) as the predominant virus (5 were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3 were the older A(H1N1) viruses); the predominant virus was influenza A(H3N2) during 16 seasons and equal proportions A(H1N1) and B in one season. Eleven seasons during this 25-year time period had two waves of influenza activity; influenza B was responsible for the second wave in 8 (73%) of those seasons (seven following A(H3N2) activity and one following A(H1N1) activity). Three seasons had a second wave of influenza A activity (two A(H3N2) and one A(H1N1)pdm09, all occurring since the 2018–2019 season.\\nMost (75% – 100%) of the influenza viruses genetically and antigenically characterized were in the same genetic subclade as, and antigenically similar to, the vaccine reference viruses included in the season's influenza vaccine. Almost all (>99.7%) of the influenza viruses collected and tested for antiviral resistance by CDC, were susceptible to zanamivir, peramivir, oseltamivir, and baloxavir .\\nThe level of influenza activity this season and during the 2022–2023 influenza season was more similar to those seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic than what was observed in the two seasons immediately after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (2020–2021 and 2021–2022). The peak percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza (18.3%) as reported to CDC from clinical laboratories nationally was slightly less than the average peak percentage positive (26.5%) during the five influenza seasons (2015–2016 – 2019–2020) immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, but this could be influenced by the addition of another virus causing significant respiratory illness. Compared to the most recent pre-COVID seasons, the cumulative rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations as reported in FluSurv-NET this season was higher than all but one season (2017–2018 season).\\nMortality attributed to influenza this season also was similar to the 2022–2023 influenza season and to what was seen in the most recent pre-COVID seasons. The peak percentage of deaths this season (1.4%) was slightly less than the 2022–2023 season (1.6%), but much more similar to pre-pandemic levels than the 2020–2021 (0.05%) and 2021–2022 seasons (0.2%). The number of pediatric deaths reported this season (197) is the second highest number of pediatric deaths attributed to influenza since the 2004–2005 season, excluding the 2009 influenza pandemic, when it became a nationally notifiable condition. The highest number of reported pediatric deaths due to influenza occurred during the 2019–20 season (199).\\nFor the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of peak influenza activity occurred within the range of what was expected based on pre-COVID-19 activity (more than 80% of seasons between 1997–98 and 2019–20 peaked between late December and late February) and activity returned to low levels by mid-May. During the 2022–2023 season, influenza activity peaked earlier than expected (early December) and the 2021–2022 season continued longer than expected (through mid-June).\\nWhile not always a predictor of the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season, Southern Hemisphere activity in the summer is often considered when planning for what could be expected during the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season. However, due to continued varied influenza activity among Southern Hemisphere countries, different influenza viruses predominating in different parts of the world, and the possibility of variations in population immunity between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, Southern Hemisphere activity cannot be used to definitively predict the timing or intensity of influenza activity in the United States this fall and winter.\\nThough influenza activity has remained low in the summer, maintaining vigilance for influenza virus infections in the United States year-round is important. Sporadic seasonal influenza virus infections and novel influenza A virus infections associated with exposure to swine during animal exhibitions often are reported during the summer months 6 . In addition, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus continue among dairy cows, poultry, and other animals, so it is important that providers and persons with exposure to sick or infected birds, cows, or other livestock remain attentive to any new symptoms, including conjunctivitis, that could be consistent with influenza virus infection 6 . Patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should isolate at home away from household members and not go to work or school until they are proven not to be infected with a novel influenza A virus or have recovered from their illness. Specimens from patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should be collected and referred to state public health departments for testing and treatment with influenza antiviral medications should be initiated immediately 14 15 .\\nWhile we do not know exactly what the coming influenza season will look like, influenza causes a significant public health burden in the United States every winter. For persons aged ≥6 months, receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences. There are also everyday preventive actions, including avoiding close contact with people who are sick, limiting contact with others if sick, and covering coughs and sneezes, that can help reduce the spread of influenza. Influenza antiviral drugs are another way to minimize the impact of influenza this coming season. CDC recommends initiating influenza antiviral drug treatment as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at increased risk for influenza-associated complications 15 . Four influenza antiviral drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration are currently recommended for use in the United States.\\nInfluenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly( Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report ) Additional information regarding influenza viruses, surveillance, vaccines, antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available online ( Influenza (Flu) ).\\nContributors: A Colón, MPH.

The flu is distinguished from the \\\"stomach flu,\\\" which is a gastrointestinal illness, and varies in severity from mild to potentially life-threatening diseases.\\n\\n### **Symptoms of Influenza:**\\nFlu symptoms typically occur suddenly and can include:\\n- Fever and chills\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Muscle or body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Fatigue (tiredness)\\n- Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\nSymptoms may differ in severity and some people might experience all symptoms, while others may have only a few.\\n\\n### **Causes of Influenza:**\\nInfluenza is caused by various influenza viruses, with types A and B responsible for seasonal flu epidemics. The virus spreads mainly through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.\\n\\n### **Risk Factors:**\\nCertain individuals are at a greater risk of developing serious complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially younger than 5 years)\\n- Adults aged 65 and older\\n- Pregnant individuals\\n- Anyone with chronic health issues (diabetes, asthma, heart disease)\\n- Immunocompromised individuals\\n\\n### **Complications:**\\nPotential complications of the flu can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Sinus infections\\n- Worsening of chronic health conditions\\n\\nIn severe cases, hospitalization or even death can occur, particularly in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n### **Diagnosis:**\\nThe diagnosis of the flu typically involves a healthcare provider evaluating medical history and symptoms, often accompanied by diagnostic tests, such as swabs taken from the nasal passage to detect the virus.\\n\\n### **Treatment:**\\nTreatment strategies may include:\\n- Antiviral medications (e.g., Oseltamivir [Tamiflu], Zanamivir, Peramivir), particularly if started within 48 hours of symptom onset.\\n- Over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms (e.g., pain relievers, decongestants).\\n- Home care through rest and increased fluid intake.\\n\\n### **Prevention:**\\nPrevention methods include:\\n- **Vaccination:** Annual flu vaccines are recommended for most people over the age of 6 months.\\n- **Hygiene Practices:** Regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when symptomatic.\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes, and disinfecting commonly-touched surfaces.\\n\\n### **Mortality and Morbidity:**\\nOn average, seasonal flu can lead to tens of thousands of deaths annually in the U.S. alone. Vaccination significantly helps reduce the risk of severe complications.\\n\\n### **Conclusion:**\\nInfluenza remains a significant public health concern that requires attention, particularly among at-risk populations. Annual vaccinations, coupled with effective hygiene practices, provide the best defense against this contagious virus.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\\n- Mayo Clinic\\n- Cleveland Clinic\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

Influenza activity in the United States during the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024) was moderately severe and within the range seen during pre-COVID-19 seasons for both timing and intensity of activity. During the 2023–2024 season, influenza activity began to increase in early November and peaked in late December 2023. Activity declined for a few weeks in January 2024 and then remained relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 before declining to inter-seasonal levels in May 2024. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus circulating during the 2023–2024 season. However, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses later in the season as overall influenza activity began to decrease. This is the third season in a row without influenza B/Yamagata viruses in circulation.\\nThis report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024) as reported to CDC through its collaborative efforts with clinical and public health laboratories, outpatient providers, emergency departments, hospitals, vital statistics offices, and public health departments. It also includes the composition of the Northern Hemisphere 2024–2025 influenza vaccines and a brief update on influenza activity occurring during the summer of 2024 in the Southern Hemisphere.\\nVirus Surveillance\\nThe influenza virologic surveillance system is comprised of the U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating laboratories and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories, which include both clinical and public health laboratories throughout the United States. Clinical laboratories primarily test for diagnostic purposes and their data are used to understand timing and intensity of influenza activity, while public health laboratories primarily test specimens for influenza for surveillance purposes to understand what influenza virus subtypes and lineages are circulating and the ages of people that are infected 1 . During the 2023–2024 influenza season, clinical laboratories reporting to CDC tested 3,910,204 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses using clinical diagnostic tests. Among these, 351,460 (9.0%) specimens tested positive, including 243,048 (69.2%) for influenza A and 108,401 (30.8%) for influenza B viruses. The overall percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza nationally each week ranged from 0.4% to 18.3% and peaked during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) before declining slightly and remaining relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 (Figure 1). The timing of peak activity for influenza A and influenza B varied (late December and late February, respectively) which contributed to the sustained period of elevated activity overall.\\nBased on the percentage of specimens testing positive in clinical laboratories, peak influenza activity in the 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions occurred between mid-December 2023 and late February 2024: HHS Regions 9 and 10 (West Coast and Pacific Northwest) peaked in mid-December; Regions 2, 3, 4, and 8 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Mountain) peaked in late December; Region 6 (South Central) peaked late in January; Region 1 (New England) peaked in early February; and Regions 5 and 7 (Midwest and Central) peaked late in February.\\nFigure 1.

Among 25,906 seasonal influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 16,875 (65.1%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 9,031 (34.9%) were influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Influenza B lineage information was available for 8,010 (87.1%) influenza B viruses, with all of them belonging to the Victoria lineage (Figure 2). No influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses have been identified worldwide since March 2020.\\nFigure 2. Influenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories*, National Summary, 2023–2024 Season\\nView Larger\\nInfluenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories*, National Summary, 2023–2024 Season\\n*This graph reflects the number of specimens tested and the number determined to be positive for influenza viruses at the public health lab (specimens tested is not the same as cases). It does not reflect specimens tested only at CDC and could include more than one specimen tested per person. Specimens tested as part of routine influenza surveillance as well as those tested as part of targeted testing for people exposed to influenza A(H5) are included. The guidance for influenza A/H5 testing recommends testing both a conjunctival and respiratory swab for people with conjunctivitis which has resulted in more specimens testing positive for influenza A/H5 than the number of human H5 cases. For more information on the number of people infected with A/H5, please visit the \\\" How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation \\\"\\nNationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus during the 2023–2024 influenza season as a whole and for each week from early November 2023 through the end of February 2024. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses co-circulated at lower levels during that time. However, as overall influenza activity decreased, A(H3N2) or B viruses were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. The co-circulation of these strains likely contributed to extending the duration of the season, with A(H3N2) and B viruses increasing as A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses decreased and A(H3N2) viruses taking over as the predominant virus in early April 2024 (Figure 2). On a regional level, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant during the season as a whole in all 10 HHS regions; however, the extent and timing of A(H3N2) and B viruses varied by region. For additional regional level data, please visit FluView Interactive.\\nAmong the influenza A viruses that were subtyped, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common virus among all age groups comprising 68.8% of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses identified in persons aged 0–4 years, 63.8% in 5–24 years, 66.0% in 25–64 years, and 63.6% in those aged 65 years or older. However, the second most frequently identified virus varied by age group: influenza B in those 0–4 and 5–24 years old, influenza A(H3N2) in those 65 years and older and approximately equal proportions of influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses in those 25–64 years.\\nVirus Characterization & Antiviral Susceptibility\\nGenetic characterization of the viruses circulating during this time period was conducted using next generation sequencing, and the genomic data were analyzed and submitted to publicly accessible databases (GenBank: GenBank Overview and EpiFlu: Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2025 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season announced ). Phylogenies of representative subsets of genetic data from CDC and other submitters can be visualized in real time at Nextstrain .\\nTo evaluate whether genetic changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) of circulating viruses affected antigenicity, antigenic characterizations were conducted using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2 and B viruses) or High-content Imaging-based micro-Neutralization Test ( HINT ) (A(H3N2) viruses) and post-infection ferret antisera raised to reference viruses representing the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses. Both assays determine how well antibodies raised to the influenza vaccine reference viruses recognize or bind to circulating viruses. HI assay measures how well antibodies inhibit the binding between the HA of the virus and the sialic acid receptors on the surface of red blood cells, whereas HINT measures how well antibodies neutralize or block virus infection of a cell.\\nCDC genetically characterized 5,348 viruses (3,865 influenza A and 1,483 influenza B) collected in the United States during October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, and antigenically characterized viruses representing various genetic clades. Overall, the vaccine antigens for each of the three major groups of the influenza viruses circulating in people (i.e., A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria) elicited antibodies that reacted well with most of the co-circulating viruses during this period (Figure 3). Detailed characterization data for each group are bellow.\\nInfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09\\nPhylogenetic analysis of the HA demonstrated that all viruses tested belonged to the 6B.1A.5a lineage and were classified in 2 clades. Clade 5a.2a represented 24.4% (n=480), and 75.6% (n=1,491) were clade 5a.2a.1. The A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines contain HA genes from clade 5a.2a.1. Nearly all (99.8%, n=573) of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were well recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses which represent the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\\nInfluenza A(H3N2)\\nAll 1,894 genetically characterized A(H3N2) viruses belonged to subclades of the 3C.2a1b.2a clade, with the majority (99.8%, n=1,891) belonging to the 2a.3a.1 subclade. The A(H3N2) component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines contain HA genes from the 3C.2a1b.2a clade. Antigenic analysis showed that 629 (95.0%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI or HINT by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses that represent the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\\nInfluenza B\\nAll influenza B viruses for which characterization was possible belonged to the B/Victoria-lineage. Infections with B/Yamagata viruses have not been identified globally since March of 2020. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes showed that all (n=1,483) belonged to clade V1A.3a.2. The genetic clade of the B/Victoria-lineage component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines is this V1A.3a.2 clade.\\nFigure 3. Genetic Clades of HA genes Based on Phylogenic Analysis of Influenza Viruses Collected Since October 1, 2023\\nView Larger\\nGenetic Clades of HA genes Based on Phylogenic Analysis of Influenza Viruses Collected Since October 1, 2023\\nCDC also assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral medications. Between October 1, 2023, and August 31, 2024, a total of 5,163 viruses collected in the United States were characterized for susceptibility to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors using sequence-based analysis, and a subset of 478 viruses (9.3%) were tested using a functional assay. Based on sequence analysis, all viruses, except 10, lacked known or suspected mutations associated with reduced inhibition by the neuraminidase inhibitors. Of these 10 viruses, 5 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses contained an NA-H275Y amino acid substitution and 1 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had a combination of NA substitutions I223V + S247N. The remaining 4 viruses were from B/Victoria lineage; two of them had a new substitution NA-A245G; one had NA-D197N; and 1 virus had NA-H273Y substitution. All viruses lacking NA mutations displayed normal inhibition by the neuraminidase inhibitors. As expected, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses containing NA-H275Y showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with substitutions I223V + S247N showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Two B/Victoria viruses with NA-A245G showed reduced inhibition by peramivir. One B/Victoria virus with NA-D197N showed reduced inhibition by peramivir and zanamivir, while another B/Victoria virus with NA-H273Y showed highly reduced inhibition by peramivir.\\nA total of 5,069 viruses were characterized for susceptibility to the polymerase acidic (PA) cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using sequence-based analysis, and a subset of 585 viruses (11.5%) were tested phenotypically. All tested viruses were susceptible to baloxavir, except 1 A(H3N2) virus with a PA-I38T amino acid substitution, which showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.\\nTable 1.

The A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria lineage and B/Yamagata lineage components are unchanged from the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. Both the egg-based and cell- or recombinant-based vaccines had a change in the A(H3N2) component. In the egg-based vaccine it was changed to an A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus and in cell- or recombinant-based vaccines it was changed to an A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus 2 3 . The genetic clade and subclade for the recommended vaccine viruses were 5a.2a.1 for A(H1N1)pdm09, 3C.2a1b.2a.3a.1 for A(H3N2), V1A.3a.2 for B/Victoria, and Y3 for B/Yamagata.\\nDue to the lack of detections of circulating B/Yamagata lineage viruses worldwide after March 2020, FDA further recommended vaccines manufactured for the U.S. population for the 2024–2025 season be trivalent, including only one B component from the B/Victoria lineage 4 .\\nTable 2.

Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be understood, and appropriate public health measures can be taken 1 .\\nFrom October 1, 2023, through August 31, 2024, a total of 21 novel influenza A virus infections were reported to CDC (Figure 4). Of the 21 novel influenza A virus infections reported, 14 avian influenza A (H5) virus detections in people were reported from 4 states (1-TX, 2-MI,10-CO, 1-MO). Four of the 14 cases were associated with exposure to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 infected dairy cattle, 9 were associated with poultry culling operations, and one case did not have a determined source. All 14 cases occurred in adults, 13 reported mild illness, and one patient with underlying medical conditions was hospitalized at the time the specimen for influenza testing was collected. All have recovered from their illness. No human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A (H5) viruses was identified associated with these cases.\\nCurrently in the United States, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in wild birds, and there have been outbreaks among other animals including commercial poultry, backyard flocks, and dairy cows. Sporadic infections in wild mammals also have been reported by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 5 . The first detections of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in dairy cows and unpasteurized milk samples from cows in Texas and Kansas were reported by USDA on March 25, 2024. As of August 31, 2024, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in 201 dairy herds from 14 states. Since 2022, HPAI A(H5) virus has been detected in commercial and backyard flocks in 48 states and has impacted over 100 million birds 5 . Updates on surveillance activities and symptom monitoring among persons exposed to animals infected with H5N1 are available at: How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation .\\nCDC recommends that state and local public health departments monitor people who are exposed to birds or other animals (including livestock) suspected to be infected with avian influenza A viruses for signs and symptoms consistent with influenza virus infection until 10 days after their last exposure and that people who develop illness be tested for influenza and treated with antiviral medication if indicated 6 . During February 9, 2022 — August 31, 2024, over 14,100 people were monitored following exposure to HPAI A(H5N1) virus infected birds, cows, or other animals.\\nOf the 21 novel influenza A virus infections reported during the 2023–2024 season, 7 were confirmed to be variant viruses (i.e., a swine influenza virus identified in a human and designated with a \\\"v\\\"). One H1N1v (OH), 4 H1N2v (PA), and 2 H3N2v (1-CO, 1-MI) virus infections were detected and reported to CDC. Among the 7 individuals infected with variant influenza viruses, 6 had documented swine exposure prior to illness, and for one the investigation did not determine a source. Among the 7 cases, 4 were hospitalized, and all recovered from their illness. Three were children <18 years old, and 4 were adults. No human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses was identified associated with these cases.\\nFigure 4. Novel Influenza A Virus Cases by Season— United States, 2010–2011 to 2023–2024 Season\\nView Larger\\nNovel Influenza A Virus Cases by Season— United States, 2010–2011 to 2023–2024 Season\\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance\\nInformation on outpatient visits to health care providers for respiratory illness, referred to as influenza-like illness ([ILI], fever plus cough or sore throat), is collected through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) 1 . Nationally, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for ILI recorded in ILINet was at or above the national baseline of 2.9% for 22 consecutive weeks from late October 2023 to late March 2024 and peaked at 6.9% during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) (Figure 5). The timing and peak percentage of visits for ILI during the 2023–2024 season were within the range of what was reported during seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be attributable to respiratory virus circulation and healthcare seeking behavior that was more similar to pre-COVID seasons than what occurred during the 2020–2021, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023 seasons.\\nOn a regional level, 8 of 10 HHS regions reported ILI activity that peaked during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52); however, Region 6 (South Central) peaked during the week ending December 23, 2023 (week 51) and Region 7 (Central) peaked during the week ending February 24, 2024 (week 8). The number of weeks of elevated activity (weeks above the region-specific baseline) varied slightly by region: Region 1 (New England) was above baseline for 23 weeks; Regions 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 4 (Southeast), 5 (Midwest), 6 (South Central), and 7 (Central) were above baseline for 20-21 weeks; Regions 2 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands), 8 (Mountain) and 9 (Pacific) were above baseline for 17-18 weeks; and Region 10 (Pacific Northwest) was above baseline for 14 weeks. Multiple respiratory viruses co-circulated during the 2023–2024 season and the contribution of influenza viruses to ILI likely varied by week and location.\\nFigure 5.

Both pediatric age groups (0–4 years and 5–24 years) had a higher percentage of visits for ILI compared to the adult age groups throughout the season. Peak activity among those 5–24 years occurred during the week ending December 23, 2023, while activity in all other age groups occurred during the week ending December 30, 2023 (Figure 6).\\nFigure 6.

From the 2008–2009 season through the 2018–2019 season ILI activity categories ranged from minimal to high; during the 2019–20 season the very high category was added 1 . For the weeks ending December 23, 2023–January 6, 2024, and February 10, 2024 (weeks 51-1, 6), more than 50% of the 55 jurisdictions experienced high or very high ILI activity each week, with the highest number (41; 74.5%) occurring during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52). This is similar to the peak weekly percentage of jurisdictions experiencing high of very high ILI activity during the past 2 seasons (2022–2023 [86%], 2021–2022 [58%]) and during the 2 seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019–20 [87.0%], 2018–2019 [59.3%]). For a weekly snapshot of geographic activity levels of ILI, please see FluView Interactive .\\nHospitalization Surveillance\\nCDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections through two surveillance systems: the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which covers approximately 9% of the U.S. population, and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance which consists of reports from all hospitals across the country (1).\\nFrom October 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024, a total of 25,390 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites. Hospitalization rates peaked nationally during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) at 8.9 per 100,000 population. This is the third highest weekly rate observed during all seasons going back to 2010–2011 (Figure 7). This season follows the 2017–2018 season which peaked at 10.2 per 100,000 during the week ending January 6, 2018 (week 1) and the 2014–2015 season which peaked at 9.0 per 100,000 during the week ending December 27, 2014 (week 52).\\nFigure 7.

Data from the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. Hospitalization rates are updated weekly as data becomes available.\\n**In 2021–2022, rates reflect cases hospitalized beginning October 1, 2021 (MMWR Week 39), but given late influenza season activity, the season was extended to June 11, 2022 (MMWR Week 23). In 2023–2024, surveillance was extended beyond April 30 for situational awareness during the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus among birds, poultry, dairy cattle, and other animals in the United States.\\nThe overall cumulative hospitalization rate through April 27, 2024 (to coincide with when FluSurv-NET surveillance typically ends) was 83.1 per 100,000 population. Since the 2009–2010 season, this is the second highest cumulative rate based, (Figure 8).\\nFigure 8.

Because surveillance for the 2023–2024 season was extended, it is recommended to not compare the cumulative rate from this season to cumulative rates from past seasons in which surveillance ended earlier.\\nAmong 25,390 influenza-associated hospitalizations, most (84.6%) were associated with influenza A virus, with 14.8% associated with influenza B virus. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 67.6% were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 32.4% were A(H3N2).\\nWhen examining rates by age, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among adults aged ≥65 years (231.0), followed by adults aged 50–64 years (98.9), children aged 0–4 years (86.1), adults aged 18–49 years (40.2), and was lowest among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years (34.3) (Figure 9). When examining age-adjusted rates by race and ethnicity, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (149.5), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (120.4), Hispanic/Latino persons (85.9), non-Hispanic White persons (65.5), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (47.5).\\nFigure 9. Cumulative Rate of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations by Age — United States, 2023–2024 influenza season\\nView Larger\\nCumulative Rate of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations by Age — United States, 2023–2024 influenza season\\nAmong 5,990 adults with information on underlying medical conditions who were hospitalized between October 1, 2023, and April 30, 2024, 94.5% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and obesity. Among 1,980 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15–49 years) with information on pregnancy status, 21.7% were pregnant. Among 1,429 hospitalized children and adolescents with information about underlying conditions, 70.7% reported at least one underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were asthma, neurologic disease, and obesity.\\nReporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance Component, the second surveillance system that tracks hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections, was between October 1, 2023, and May 4, 2024. During that time, 229,442 influenza associated hospitalizations were reported yielding a cumulative national influenza associated hospitalization rate of 69.2 per 100,000 population for the season. Hospitalizations began to increase in early November, peaking nationally during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) at 20,534 hospitalizations (6.2 hospitalizations per 100,000 population) before declining slightly and remaining relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 (Figure 10). While the peak weekly number of hospitalizations during the 2023–2024 season (20,534) was slightly lower than the peak weekly number during the 2022–2023 season (25,882), the total number of hospitalizations was higher this season (229,442) than it was during the same time period of the 2022–2023 season (209,338) due to the extended period of elevated activity this season.\\nFigure 10.

Regions 1 (New England) and 6 (South Central) peaked one week later (the week ending January 6, 2024) and Region 7 (Central) peaked during the week ending March 2, 2024 (week 9). Hospitalization rates in Regions 1 (New England), 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 5 (Midwest), and 6 (South Central) had a bimodal distribution, with smaller secondary peaks occurring in early March 2024 following the initial peak in late December and early January 2024. On a regional level, cumulative hospitalization rates ranged from 39.7 to 82.7 per 100,000 with 7 regions reporting a cumulative rate greater than 70 per 100,000. For additional details, see FluView Interactive .\\nMortality Surveillance\\nAccording to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance System 1 , during October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, a total of 2,774,168 deaths from all causes were reported nationally. Among these, 10,289 (0.4%) had influenza listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death. The weekly percentage of deaths due to influenza ranged from 0.03% to 1.3% and peaked during the week ending January 6, 2024 (week 1) (Figure 11). Influenza deaths began to increase in late November 2023, peaking in early January 2024 (week 1), and then declined. This peak occurred later in the season compared to the 2022–2023 influenza season, which peaked at 1.6% during mid-December 2022; however, it was slightly earlier than recent pre-COVID influenza seasons, which peaked between late January 2018 (2017–2018 season) and mid-March 2016 (2015–2016 season). While the peak weekly percentage of deaths due to influenza was lower during this season compared to last, the cumulative percentage of deaths due to influenza was slightly higher (0.4% during 2023–2024 compared with 0.3% during 2022–2023) due to longer duration of elevated influenza-associated mortality.\\nFigure 11. Influenza Mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, 2019–20 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\nView Larger\\nInfluenza Mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, 2019–20 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\n*Data presented are current as of September 9, 2024.\\nCDC monitors influenza-associated deaths in children younger than 18 years of age through the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System 1 . During October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, a total of 197 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC (Figure 12); this is nearly equal to the highest number of deaths reported during a seasonal influenza epidemic (199 deaths reported during the 2019–2020 season). Since influenza-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of influenza-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 during the 2011–2012 season to 199 during the 2019–20 season. This season, 104 of the reported deaths were associated with influenza A viruses, 90 were associated with influenza B viruses, and 3 were associated with influenza A and B virus co-infection. Of 60 influenza A viruses with a reported subtype, 44 (73.3%) were influenza A (H1N1) and 16 (26.7%) were influenza A (H3N2). Fourteen deaths associated with influenza B viruses had a lineage reported, and all were B/Victoria lineage viruses. No pediatric deaths associated with influenza B/Yamagata have been reported since the 2017–2018 season. The mean age at death was 7 years (range = 4 weeks–17 years). Location of deaths were known for all children and adolescents; most (112 [56.9%]) died after hospital admission; 56 (28.4%) died in an emergency room; and 29 (14.7%) died outside of a hospital setting. Among the 187 children and adolescents with a known medical history, 93 (49.7%) had at least one underlying medical condition associated with higher risk for developing serious influenza-related complications 7 . Among the 157 children and adolescents who were eligible for influenza vaccination (age ≥6 months at date of illness onset) and for whom vaccination status was known, 130 (82.8%) were not fully vaccinated.\\nFigure 12. Number of Influenza-Associated Pediatric Deaths by Virus Type and Week of Death, 2020–2021 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\nView Larger\\nNumber of Influenza-Associated Pediatric Deaths by Virus Type and Week of Death, 2020–2021 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\n*Data shown are current as of September 9, 2024, and include deaths occurring until August 31, 2024. Additional pediatric deaths that occurred during this time period may continue to be reported as they are identified. The total number of deaths will be updated in FluView and on FluView Interactive as they are received.\\nInfluenza Disease Burden and Prevented Burden from Vaccination\\nCDC does not know the exact number of people who have been sick and affected by influenza viruses because influenza virus infection is not a reportable disease in most areas of the United States. However, CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the number of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occur each season 8 . Preliminary end of season estimates of influenza disease burden in the United States for the 2023–2024 season, from October 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024, show that influenza virus infection likely resulted in between 34 million–75 million symptomatic illnesses, 15 million-33 million medical visits, 380,000-900,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000-100,000 deaths. Older adults (≥65 years) accounted for 51% of hospitalizations and 68% of deaths.\\nIn addition to estimating the disease burden, CDC also estimates the benefit of influenza vaccination by calculating the number of illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that are prevented by vaccination. CDC uses a compartmental model to estimate the burden that would have occurred without vaccination and the burden that occurred with vaccination 8 . The difference between these two estimates is the vaccine prevented burden. During the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – April 30, 2024), influenza vaccine coverage ranged from 37% among those 18–49 years to 73% among older adults ≥65 years (FluVaxView: Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard ) Influenza vaccine effectiveness in outpatient settings ranged from 34% to 64% depending on age group 9 . For the 2023–2024 season, CDC preliminarily estimates that influenza vaccination prevented between 7.4 million-15 million symptomatic illnesses, 3.6 million-7.4 million medical visits, 100,000-240,000 hospitalizations, and 3,500-34,000) deaths.\\nBoth disease and prevented burden will be updated later in the calendar year and updated estimates will be posted to the CDC websites for disease burden and averted burden.\\nSeasonal Severity Assessment\\nEach season, CDC classifies influenza season severity at the end of each season using influenza virus activity data, including influenza-like illness, influenza hospitalization rates, and influenza deaths to compare to the same data from past seasons and to classify the severity of the influenza season 10 . Severity is classified across all age groups and for children, adults, and older adults. The severity of the 2023–2024 season was classified as moderately severe across all age groups and for children, adults, and older adults.\\nInfluenza Activity in the Southern Hemisphere\\nInfluenza follows a seasonal pattern in Southern Hemisphere countries, with activity usually occurring between April and September and sometimes lasting until October or November. Based on data collected and submitted by countries to the World Health Organization's FluNet system 11 , as of late-August 2024, influenza activity peaked and is declining in most Southern Hemisphere countries in South America, while activity in countries in Southern Africa and Oceania persists. In South America and Australia (which provides most of the data for the Oceania region), most influenza virus detections reported this season have been influenza A(H3N2) viruses, except in Ecuador where influenza B predominated. In Southern Africa, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have predominated, though influenza B detections have increased in recent weeks.\\nIn comparison to seasonal influenza trends observed before the COVID-19 pandemic, three South American countries—Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay—reported data suggesting an earlier start to their 2024 influenza seasons while the remaining countries reported timing of activity similar to what was observed before the COVID-19 pandemic. Most countries in South America, Southern Africa, and Oceania have had influenza activity reach moderate levels, in line with levels observed in prior seasons, though two countries experienced very high influenza virus detection levels: Chile and Zambia driven by circulation of A(H3N2) and co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses, respectively. Influenza virus detections among individuals with severe acute respiratory infections (i.e., SARI cases, defined as a hospitalized case reporting a cough and fever, with symptom onset in the last 10 days) reached very high levels in Chile and Zambia, and high levels in Uruguay, Ecuador, and South Africa 12 13 .\\nOf note, Ghana, Senegal, and Lao People's Democratic Republic, which are tropical countries in the Northern Hemisphere, have reported higher levels of influenza detections than expected for this time of year compared to seasonal influenza trends observed before the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nDiscussion\\nThe 2023–2024 influenza season in the United States is considered moderately severe with an estimate of at least 34 million symptomatic illnesses, 15 million medical visits, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000 deaths caused by influenza virus infection. The predominant influenza virus overall during the 2023–2024 influenza season was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. However, as A(H1N1)pdm09 activity declined, A(H3N2) and B/Victoria virus activity continued to increase for several more weeks and, each were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from early March until mid-May. From June through August, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses co-circulated and influenza B viruses were reported in small numbers. Eight of the previous 25 seasons (1997–98 through 2022–2023, excluding the 2020–2021 season due to low influenza virus circulation), were characterized by A(H1N1) as the predominant virus (5 were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3 were the older A(H1N1) viruses); the predominant virus was influenza A(H3N2) during 16 seasons and equal proportions A(H1N1) and B in one season. Eleven seasons during this 25-year time period had two waves of influenza activity; influenza B was responsible for the second wave in 8 (73%) of those seasons (seven following A(H3N2) activity and one following A(H1N1) activity). Three seasons had a second wave of influenza A activity (two A(H3N2) and one A(H1N1)pdm09, all occurring since the 2018–2019 season.\\nMost (75% – 100%) of the influenza viruses genetically and antigenically characterized were in the same genetic subclade as, and antigenically similar to, the vaccine reference viruses included in the season's influenza vaccine. Almost all (>99.7%) of the influenza viruses collected and tested for antiviral resistance by CDC, were susceptible to zanamivir, peramivir, oseltamivir, and baloxavir .\\nThe level of influenza activity this season and during the 2022–2023 influenza season was more similar to those seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic than what was observed in the two seasons immediately after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (2020–2021 and 2021–2022). The peak percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza (18.3%) as reported to CDC from clinical laboratories nationally was slightly less than the average peak percentage positive (26.5%) during the five influenza seasons (2015–2016 – 2019–2020) immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, but this could be influenced by the addition of another virus causing significant respiratory illness. Compared to the most recent pre-COVID seasons, the cumulative rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations as reported in FluSurv-NET this season was higher than all but one season (2017–2018 season).\\nMortality attributed to influenza this season also was similar to the 2022–2023 influenza season and to what was seen in the most recent pre-COVID seasons. The peak percentage of deaths this season (1.4%) was slightly less than the 2022–2023 season (1.6%), but much more similar to pre-pandemic levels than the 2020–2021 (0.05%) and 2021–2022 seasons (0.2%). The number of pediatric deaths reported this season (197) is the second highest number of pediatric deaths attributed to influenza since the 2004–2005 season, excluding the 2009 influenza pandemic, when it became a nationally notifiable condition. The highest number of reported pediatric deaths due to influenza occurred during the 2019–20 season (199).\\nFor the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of peak influenza activity occurred within the range of what was expected based on pre-COVID-19 activity (more than 80% of seasons between 1997–98 and 2019–20 peaked between late December and late February) and activity returned to low levels by mid-May. During the 2022–2023 season, influenza activity peaked earlier than expected (early December) and the 2021–2022 season continued longer than expected (through mid-June).\\nWhile not always a predictor of the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season, Southern Hemisphere activity in the summer is often considered when planning for what could be expected during the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season. However, due to continued varied influenza activity among Southern Hemisphere countries, different influenza viruses predominating in different parts of the world, and the possibility of variations in population immunity between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, Southern Hemisphere activity cannot be used to definitively predict the timing or intensity of influenza activity in the United States this fall and winter.\\nThough influenza activity has remained low in the summer, maintaining vigilance for influenza virus infections in the United States year-round is important. Sporadic seasonal influenza virus infections and novel influenza A virus infections associated with exposure to swine during animal exhibitions often are reported during the summer months 6 . In addition, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus continue among dairy cows, poultry, and other animals, so it is important that providers and persons with exposure to sick or infected birds, cows, or other livestock remain attentive to any new symptoms, including conjunctivitis, that could be consistent with influenza virus infection 6 . Patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should isolate at home away from household members and not go to work or school until they are proven not to be infected with a novel influenza A virus or have recovered from their illness. Specimens from patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should be collected and referred to state public health departments for testing and treatment with influenza antiviral medications should be initiated immediately 14 15 .\\nWhile we do not know exactly what the coming influenza season will look like, influenza causes a significant public health burden in the United States every winter. For persons aged ≥6 months, receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences. There are also everyday preventive actions, including avoiding close contact with people who are sick, limiting contact with others if sick, and covering coughs and sneezes, that can help reduce the spread of influenza. Influenza antiviral drugs are another way to minimize the impact of influenza this coming season. CDC recommends initiating influenza antiviral drug treatment as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at increased risk for influenza-associated complications 15 . Four influenza antiviral drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration are currently recommended for use in the United States.\\nInfluenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly( Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report ) Additional information regarding influenza viruses, surveillance, vaccines, antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available online ( Influenza (Flu) ).\\nContributors: A Colón, MPH.

Unlike the common misconception, influenza is not to be confused with the \\\"stomach flu,\\\" which refers to gastrointestinal illnesses.

The flu is distinguished from the \\\"stomach flu,\\\" which is a gastrointestinal illness, and varies in severity from mild to potentially life-threatening diseases.\\n\\n### **Symptoms of Influenza:**\\nFlu symptoms typically occur suddenly and can include:\\n- Fever and chills\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Muscle or body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Fatigue (tiredness)\\n- Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\nSymptoms may differ in severity and some people might experience all symptoms, while others may have only a few.\\n\\n### **Causes of Influenza:**\\nInfluenza is caused by various influenza viruses, with types A and B responsible for seasonal flu epidemics. The virus spreads mainly through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.\\n\\n### **Risk Factors:**\\nCertain individuals are at a greater risk of developing serious complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially younger than 5 years)\\n- Adults aged 65 and older\\n- Pregnant individuals\\n- Anyone with chronic health issues (diabetes, asthma, heart disease)\\n- Immunocompromised individuals\\n\\n### **Complications:**\\nPotential complications of the flu can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Sinus infections\\n- Worsening of chronic health conditions\\n\\nIn severe cases, hospitalization or even death can occur, particularly in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n### **Diagnosis:**\\nThe diagnosis of the flu typically involves a healthcare provider evaluating medical history and symptoms, often accompanied by diagnostic tests, such as swabs taken from the nasal passage to detect the virus.\\n\\n### **Treatment:**\\nTreatment strategies may include:\\n- Antiviral medications (e.g., Oseltamivir [Tamiflu], Zanamivir, Peramivir), particularly if started within 48 hours of symptom onset.\\n- Over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms (e.g., pain relievers, decongestants).\\n- Home care through rest and increased fluid intake.\\n\\n### **Prevention:**\\nPrevention methods include:\\n- **Vaccination:** Annual flu vaccines are recommended for most people over the age of 6 months.\\n- **Hygiene Practices:** Regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when symptomatic.\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes, and disinfecting commonly-touched surfaces.\\n\\n### **Mortality and Morbidity:**\\nOn average, seasonal flu can lead to tens of thousands of deaths annually in the U.S. alone. Vaccination significantly helps reduce the risk of severe complications.\\n\\n### **Conclusion:**\\nInfluenza remains a significant public health concern that requires attention, particularly among at-risk populations. Annual vaccinations, coupled with effective hygiene practices, provide the best defense against this contagious virus.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\\n- Mayo Clinic\\n- Cleveland Clinic\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

Influenza activity in the United States during the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024) was moderately severe and within the range seen during pre-COVID-19 seasons for both timing and intensity of activity. During the 2023–2024 season, influenza activity began to increase in early November and peaked in late December 2023. Activity declined for a few weeks in January 2024 and then remained relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 before declining to inter-seasonal levels in May 2024. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus circulating during the 2023–2024 season. However, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses later in the season as overall influenza activity began to decrease. This is the third season in a row without influenza B/Yamagata viruses in circulation.\\nThis report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024) as reported to CDC through its collaborative efforts with clinical and public health laboratories, outpatient providers, emergency departments, hospitals, vital statistics offices, and public health departments. It also includes the composition of the Northern Hemisphere 2024–2025 influenza vaccines and a brief update on influenza activity occurring during the summer of 2024 in the Southern Hemisphere.\\nVirus Surveillance\\nThe influenza virologic surveillance system is comprised of the U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating laboratories and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories, which include both clinical and public health laboratories throughout the United States. Clinical laboratories primarily test for diagnostic purposes and their data are used to understand timing and intensity of influenza activity, while public health laboratories primarily test specimens for influenza for surveillance purposes to understand what influenza virus subtypes and lineages are circulating and the ages of people that are infected 1 . During the 2023–2024 influenza season, clinical laboratories reporting to CDC tested 3,910,204 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses using clinical diagnostic tests. Among these, 351,460 (9.0%) specimens tested positive, including 243,048 (69.2%) for influenza A and 108,401 (30.8%) for influenza B viruses. The overall percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza nationally each week ranged from 0.4% to 18.3% and peaked during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) before declining slightly and remaining relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 (Figure 1). The timing of peak activity for influenza A and influenza B varied (late December and late February, respectively) which contributed to the sustained period of elevated activity overall.\\nBased on the percentage of specimens testing positive in clinical laboratories, peak influenza activity in the 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions occurred between mid-December 2023 and late February 2024: HHS Regions 9 and 10 (West Coast and Pacific Northwest) peaked in mid-December; Regions 2, 3, 4, and 8 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Mountain) peaked in late December; Region 6 (South Central) peaked late in January; Region 1 (New England) peaked in early February; and Regions 5 and 7 (Midwest and Central) peaked late in February.\\nFigure 1.

Among 25,906 seasonal influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 16,875 (65.1%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 9,031 (34.9%) were influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Influenza B lineage information was available for 8,010 (87.1%) influenza B viruses, with all of them belonging to the Victoria lineage (Figure 2). No influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses have been identified worldwide since March 2020.\\nFigure 2. Influenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories*, National Summary, 2023–2024 Season\\nView Larger\\nInfluenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories*, National Summary, 2023–2024 Season\\n*This graph reflects the number of specimens tested and the number determined to be positive for influenza viruses at the public health lab (specimens tested is not the same as cases). It does not reflect specimens tested only at CDC and could include more than one specimen tested per person. Specimens tested as part of routine influenza surveillance as well as those tested as part of targeted testing for people exposed to influenza A(H5) are included. The guidance for influenza A/H5 testing recommends testing both a conjunctival and respiratory swab for people with conjunctivitis which has resulted in more specimens testing positive for influenza A/H5 than the number of human H5 cases. For more information on the number of people infected with A/H5, please visit the \\\" How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation \\\"\\nNationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus during the 2023–2024 influenza season as a whole and for each week from early November 2023 through the end of February 2024. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses co-circulated at lower levels during that time. However, as overall influenza activity decreased, A(H3N2) or B viruses were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. The co-circulation of these strains likely contributed to extending the duration of the season, with A(H3N2) and B viruses increasing as A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses decreased and A(H3N2) viruses taking over as the predominant virus in early April 2024 (Figure 2). On a regional level, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant during the season as a whole in all 10 HHS regions; however, the extent and timing of A(H3N2) and B viruses varied by region. For additional regional level data, please visit FluView Interactive.\\nAmong the influenza A viruses that were subtyped, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common virus among all age groups comprising 68.8% of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses identified in persons aged 0–4 years, 63.8% in 5–24 years, 66.0% in 25–64 years, and 63.6% in those aged 65 years or older. However, the second most frequently identified virus varied by age group: influenza B in those 0–4 and 5–24 years old, influenza A(H3N2) in those 65 years and older and approximately equal proportions of influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses in those 25–64 years.\\nVirus Characterization & Antiviral Susceptibility\\nGenetic characterization of the viruses circulating during this time period was conducted using next generation sequencing, and the genomic data were analyzed and submitted to publicly accessible databases (GenBank: GenBank Overview and EpiFlu: Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2025 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season announced ). Phylogenies of representative subsets of genetic data from CDC and other submitters can be visualized in real time at Nextstrain .\\nTo evaluate whether genetic changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) of circulating viruses affected antigenicity, antigenic characterizations were conducted using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2 and B viruses) or High-content Imaging-based micro-Neutralization Test ( HINT ) (A(H3N2) viruses) and post-infection ferret antisera raised to reference viruses representing the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses. Both assays determine how well antibodies raised to the influenza vaccine reference viruses recognize or bind to circulating viruses. HI assay measures how well antibodies inhibit the binding between the HA of the virus and the sialic acid receptors on the surface of red blood cells, whereas HINT measures how well antibodies neutralize or block virus infection of a cell.\\nCDC genetically characterized 5,348 viruses (3,865 influenza A and 1,483 influenza B) collected in the United States during October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, and antigenically characterized viruses representing various genetic clades. Overall, the vaccine antigens for each of the three major groups of the influenza viruses circulating in people (i.e., A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria) elicited antibodies that reacted well with most of the co-circulating viruses during this period (Figure 3). Detailed characterization data for each group are bellow.\\nInfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09\\nPhylogenetic analysis of the HA demonstrated that all viruses tested belonged to the 6B.1A.5a lineage and were classified in 2 clades. Clade 5a.2a represented 24.4% (n=480), and 75.6% (n=1,491) were clade 5a.2a.1. The A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines contain HA genes from clade 5a.2a.1. Nearly all (99.8%, n=573) of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were well recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses which represent the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\\nInfluenza A(H3N2)\\nAll 1,894 genetically characterized A(H3N2) viruses belonged to subclades of the 3C.2a1b.2a clade, with the majority (99.8%, n=1,891) belonging to the 2a.3a.1 subclade. The A(H3N2) component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines contain HA genes from the 3C.2a1b.2a clade. Antigenic analysis showed that 629 (95.0%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI or HINT by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses that represent the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\\nInfluenza B\\nAll influenza B viruses for which characterization was possible belonged to the B/Victoria-lineage. Infections with B/Yamagata viruses have not been identified globally since March of 2020. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes showed that all (n=1,483) belonged to clade V1A.3a.2. The genetic clade of the B/Victoria-lineage component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines is this V1A.3a.2 clade.\\nFigure 3.

Between October 1, 2023, and August 31, 2024, a total of 5,163 viruses collected in the United States were characterized for susceptibility to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors using sequence-based analysis, and a subset of 478 viruses (9.3%) were tested using a functional assay. Based on sequence analysis, all viruses, except 10, lacked known or suspected mutations associated with reduced inhibition by the neuraminidase inhibitors. Of these 10 viruses, 5 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses contained an NA-H275Y amino acid substitution and 1 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had a combination of NA substitutions I223V + S247N. The remaining 4 viruses were from B/Victoria lineage; two of them had a new substitution NA-A245G; one had NA-D197N; and 1 virus had NA-H273Y substitution. All viruses lacking NA mutations displayed normal inhibition by the neuraminidase inhibitors. As expected, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses containing NA-H275Y showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with substitutions I223V + S247N showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Two B/Victoria viruses with NA-A245G showed reduced inhibition by peramivir. One B/Victoria virus with NA-D197N showed reduced inhibition by peramivir and zanamivir, while another B/Victoria virus with NA-H273Y showed highly reduced inhibition by peramivir.\\nA total of 5,069 viruses were characterized for susceptibility to the polymerase acidic (PA) cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using sequence-based analysis, and a subset of 585 viruses (11.5%) were tested phenotypically. All tested viruses were susceptible to baloxavir, except 1 A(H3N2) virus with a PA-I38T amino acid substitution, which showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.\\nTable 1.

The A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria lineage and B/Yamagata lineage components are unchanged from the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. Both the egg-based and cell- or recombinant-based vaccines had a change in the A(H3N2) component. In the egg-based vaccine it was changed to an A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus and in cell- or recombinant-based vaccines it was changed to an A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus 2 3 . The genetic clade and subclade for the recommended vaccine viruses were 5a.2a.1 for A(H1N1)pdm09, 3C.2a1b.2a.3a.1 for A(H3N2), V1A.3a.2 for B/Victoria, and Y3 for B/Yamagata.\\nDue to the lack of detections of circulating B/Yamagata lineage viruses worldwide after March 2020, FDA further recommended vaccines manufactured for the U.S. population for the 2024–2025 season be trivalent, including only one B component from the B/Victoria lineage 4 .\\nTable 2.

Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be understood, and appropriate public health measures can be taken 1 .\\nFrom October 1, 2023, through August 31, 2024, a total of 21 novel influenza A virus infections were reported to CDC (Figure 4). Of the 21 novel influenza A virus infections reported, 14 avian influenza A (H5) virus detections in people were reported from 4 states (1-TX, 2-MI,10-CO, 1-MO). Four of the 14 cases were associated with exposure to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 infected dairy cattle, 9 were associated with poultry culling operations, and one case did not have a determined source. All 14 cases occurred in adults, 13 reported mild illness, and one patient with underlying medical conditions was hospitalized at the time the specimen for influenza testing was collected. All have recovered from their illness. No human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A (H5) viruses was identified associated with these cases.\\nCurrently in the United States, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in wild birds, and there have been outbreaks among other animals including commercial poultry, backyard flocks, and dairy cows. Sporadic infections in wild mammals also have been reported by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 5 . The first detections of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in dairy cows and unpasteurized milk samples from cows in Texas and Kansas were reported by USDA on March 25, 2024. As of August 31, 2024, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in 201 dairy herds from 14 states. Since 2022, HPAI A(H5) virus has been detected in commercial and backyard flocks in 48 states and has impacted over 100 million birds 5 . Updates on surveillance activities and symptom monitoring among persons exposed to animals infected with H5N1 are available at: How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation .\\nCDC recommends that state and local public health departments monitor people who are exposed to birds or other animals (including livestock) suspected to be infected with avian influenza A viruses for signs and symptoms consistent with influenza virus infection until 10 days after their last exposure and that people who develop illness be tested for influenza and treated with antiviral medication if indicated 6 . During February 9, 2022 — August 31, 2024, over 14,100 people were monitored following exposure to HPAI A(H5N1) virus infected birds, cows, or other animals.\\nOf the 21 novel influenza A virus infections reported during the 2023–2024 season, 7 were confirmed to be variant viruses (i.e., a swine influenza virus identified in a human and designated with a \\\"v\\\"). One H1N1v (OH), 4 H1N2v (PA), and 2 H3N2v (1-CO, 1-MI) virus infections were detected and reported to CDC. Among the 7 individuals infected with variant influenza viruses, 6 had documented swine exposure prior to illness, and for one the investigation did not determine a source. Among the 7 cases, 4 were hospitalized, and all recovered from their illness. Three were children <18 years old, and 4 were adults. No human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses was identified associated with these cases.\\nFigure 4. Novel Influenza A Virus Cases by Season— United States, 2010–2011 to 2023–2024 Season\\nView Larger\\nNovel Influenza A Virus Cases by Season— United States, 2010–2011 to 2023–2024 Season\\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance\\nInformation on outpatient visits to health care providers for respiratory illness, referred to as influenza-like illness ([ILI], fever plus cough or sore throat), is collected through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) 1 . Nationally, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for ILI recorded in ILINet was at or above the national baseline of 2.9% for 22 consecutive weeks from late October 2023 to late March 2024 and peaked at 6.9% during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) (Figure 5). The timing and peak percentage of visits for ILI during the 2023–2024 season were within the range of what was reported during seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be attributable to respiratory virus circulation and healthcare seeking behavior that was more similar to pre-COVID seasons than what occurred during the 2020–2021, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023 seasons.\\nOn a regional level, 8 of 10 HHS regions reported ILI activity that peaked during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52); however, Region 6 (South Central) peaked during the week ending December 23, 2023 (week 51) and Region 7 (Central) peaked during the week ending February 24, 2024 (week 8). The number of weeks of elevated activity (weeks above the region-specific baseline) varied slightly by region: Region 1 (New England) was above baseline for 23 weeks; Regions 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 4 (Southeast), 5 (Midwest), 6 (South Central), and 7 (Central) were above baseline for 20-21 weeks; Regions 2 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands), 8 (Mountain) and 9 (Pacific) were above baseline for 17-18 weeks; and Region 10 (Pacific Northwest) was above baseline for 14 weeks. Multiple respiratory viruses co-circulated during the 2023–2024 season and the contribution of influenza viruses to ILI likely varied by week and location.\\nFigure 5.

Both pediatric age groups (0–4 years and 5–24 years) had a higher percentage of visits for ILI compared to the adult age groups throughout the season. Peak activity among those 5–24 years occurred during the week ending December 23, 2023, while activity in all other age groups occurred during the week ending December 30, 2023 (Figure 6).\\nFigure 6.

From the 2008–2009 season through the 2018–2019 season ILI activity categories ranged from minimal to high; during the 2019–20 season the very high category was added 1 . For the weeks ending December 23, 2023–January 6, 2024, and February 10, 2024 (weeks 51-1, 6), more than 50% of the 55 jurisdictions experienced high or very high ILI activity each week, with the highest number (41; 74.5%) occurring during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52). This is similar to the peak weekly percentage of jurisdictions experiencing high of very high ILI activity during the past 2 seasons (2022–2023 [86%], 2021–2022 [58%]) and during the 2 seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019–20 [87.0%], 2018–2019 [59.3%]). For a weekly snapshot of geographic activity levels of ILI, please see FluView Interactive .\\nHospitalization Surveillance\\nCDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections through two surveillance systems: the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which covers approximately 9% of the U.S. population, and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance which consists of reports from all hospitals across the country (1).\\nFrom October 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024, a total of 25,390 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites. Hospitalization rates peaked nationally during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) at 8.9 per 100,000 population. This is the third highest weekly rate observed during all seasons going back to 2010–2011 (Figure 7). This season follows the 2017–2018 season which peaked at 10.2 per 100,000 during the week ending January 6, 2018 (week 1) and the 2014–2015 season which peaked at 9.0 per 100,000 during the week ending December 27, 2014 (week 52).\\nFigure 7.

Data from the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. Hospitalization rates are updated weekly as data becomes available.\\n**In 2021–2022, rates reflect cases hospitalized beginning October 1, 2021 (MMWR Week 39), but given late influenza season activity, the season was extended to June 11, 2022 (MMWR Week 23). In 2023–2024, surveillance was extended beyond April 30 for situational awareness during the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus among birds, poultry, dairy cattle, and other animals in the United States.\\nThe overall cumulative hospitalization rate through April 27, 2024 (to coincide with when FluSurv-NET surveillance typically ends) was 83.1 per 100,000 population. Since the 2009–2010 season, this is the second highest cumulative rate based, (Figure 8).\\nFigure 8. Cumulative Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations — United States, 2014–2015 to 2023–2024 influenza seasons\\nView Larger\\nCumulative Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations — United States, 2014–2015 to 2023–2024 influenza seasons\\n*In 2021–2022, rates reflect cases hospitalized beginning October 1, 2021 (MMWR Week 39), but given late influenza season activity, the season was extended to June 11, 2022 (MMWR Week 23). In 2023–2024, surveillance was extended beyond April 30 for situational awareness during the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus among birds, poultry, dairy cattle, and other animals in the United States. Because surveillance for the 2023–2024 season was extended, it is recommended to not compare the cumulative rate from this season to cumulative rates from past seasons in which surveillance ended earlier.\\nAmong 25,390 influenza-associated hospitalizations, most (84.6%) were associated with influenza A virus, with 14.8% associated with influenza B virus. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 67.6% were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 32.4% were A(H3N2).\\nWhen examining rates by age, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among adults aged ≥65 years (231.0), followed by adults aged 50–64 years (98.9), children aged 0–4 years (86.1), adults aged 18–49 years (40.2), and was lowest among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years (34.3) (Figure 9). When examining age-adjusted rates by race and ethnicity, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (149.5), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (120.4), Hispanic/Latino persons (85.9), non-Hispanic White persons (65.5), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (47.5).\\nFigure 9. Cumulative Rate of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations by Age — United States, 2023–2024 influenza season\\nView Larger\\nCumulative Rate of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations by Age — United States, 2023–2024 influenza season\\nAmong 5,990 adults with information on underlying medical conditions who were hospitalized between October 1, 2023, and April 30, 2024, 94.5% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and obesity. Among 1,980 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15–49 years) with information on pregnancy status, 21.7% were pregnant. Among 1,429 hospitalized children and adolescents with information about underlying conditions, 70.7% reported at least one underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were asthma, neurologic disease, and obesity.\\nReporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance Component, the second surveillance system that tracks hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections, was between October 1, 2023, and May 4, 2024. During that time, 229,442 influenza associated hospitalizations were reported yielding a cumulative national influenza associated hospitalization rate of 69.2 per 100,000 population for the season. Hospitalizations began to increase in early November, peaking nationally during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) at 20,534 hospitalizations (6.2 hospitalizations per 100,000 population) before declining slightly and remaining relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 (Figure 10). While the peak weekly number of hospitalizations during the 2023–2024 season (20,534) was slightly lower than the peak weekly number during the 2022–2023 season (25,882), the total number of hospitalizations was higher this season (229,442) than it was during the same time period of the 2022–2023 season (209,338) due to the extended period of elevated activity this season.\\nFigure 10.

Regions 1 (New England) and 6 (South Central) peaked one week later (the week ending January 6, 2024) and Region 7 (Central) peaked during the week ending March 2, 2024 (week 9). Hospitalization rates in Regions 1 (New England), 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 5 (Midwest), and 6 (South Central) had a bimodal distribution, with smaller secondary peaks occurring in early March 2024 following the initial peak in late December and early January 2024. On a regional level, cumulative hospitalization rates ranged from 39.7 to 82.7 per 100,000 with 7 regions reporting a cumulative rate greater than 70 per 100,000. For additional details, see FluView Interactive .\\nMortality Surveillance\\nAccording to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance System 1 , during October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, a total of 2,774,168 deaths from all causes were reported nationally. Among these, 10,289 (0.4%) had influenza listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death. The weekly percentage of deaths due to influenza ranged from 0.03% to 1.3% and peaked during the week ending January 6, 2024 (week 1) (Figure 11). Influenza deaths began to increase in late November 2023, peaking in early January 2024 (week 1), and then declined. This peak occurred later in the season compared to the 2022–2023 influenza season, which peaked at 1.6% during mid-December 2022; however, it was slightly earlier than recent pre-COVID influenza seasons, which peaked between late January 2018 (2017–2018 season) and mid-March 2016 (2015–2016 season). While the peak weekly percentage of deaths due to influenza was lower during this season compared to last, the cumulative percentage of deaths due to influenza was slightly higher (0.4% during 2023–2024 compared with 0.3% during 2022–2023) due to longer duration of elevated influenza-associated mortality.\\nFigure 11. Influenza Mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, 2019–20 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\nView Larger\\nInfluenza Mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, 2019–20 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\n*Data presented are current as of September 9, 2024.\\nCDC monitors influenza-associated deaths in children younger than 18 years of age through the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System 1 . During October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, a total of 197 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC (Figure 12); this is nearly equal to the highest number of deaths reported during a seasonal influenza epidemic (199 deaths reported during the 2019–2020 season). Since influenza-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of influenza-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 during the 2011–2012 season to 199 during the 2019–20 season. This season, 104 of the reported deaths were associated with influenza A viruses, 90 were associated with influenza B viruses, and 3 were associated with influenza A and B virus co-infection. Of 60 influenza A viruses with a reported subtype, 44 (73.3%) were influenza A (H1N1) and 16 (26.7%) were influenza A (H3N2). Fourteen deaths associated with influenza B viruses had a lineage reported, and all were B/Victoria lineage viruses. No pediatric deaths associated with influenza B/Yamagata have been reported since the 2017–2018 season. The mean age at death was 7 years (range = 4 weeks–17 years). Location of deaths were known for all children and adolescents; most (112 [56.9%]) died after hospital admission; 56 (28.4%) died in an emergency room; and 29 (14.7%) died outside of a hospital setting. Among the 187 children and adolescents with a known medical history, 93 (49.7%) had at least one underlying medical condition associated with higher risk for developing serious influenza-related complications 7 . Among the 157 children and adolescents who were eligible for influenza vaccination (age ≥6 months at date of illness onset) and for whom vaccination status was known, 130 (82.8%) were not fully vaccinated.\\nFigure 12. Number of Influenza-Associated Pediatric Deaths by Virus Type and Week of Death, 2020–2021 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\nView Larger\\nNumber of Influenza-Associated Pediatric Deaths by Virus Type and Week of Death, 2020–2021 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\n*Data shown are current as of September 9, 2024, and include deaths occurring until August 31, 2024. Additional pediatric deaths that occurred during this time period may continue to be reported as they are identified. The total number of deaths will be updated in FluView and on FluView Interactive as they are received.\\nInfluenza Disease Burden and Prevented Burden from Vaccination\\nCDC does not know the exact number of people who have been sick and affected by influenza viruses because influenza virus infection is not a reportable disease in most areas of the United States. However, CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the number of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occur each season 8 . Preliminary end of season estimates of influenza disease burden in the United States for the 2023–2024 season, from October 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024, show that influenza virus infection likely resulted in between 34 million–75 million symptomatic illnesses, 15 million-33 million medical visits, 380,000-900,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000-100,000 deaths. Older adults (≥65 years) accounted for 51% of hospitalizations and 68% of deaths.\\nIn addition to estimating the disease burden, CDC also estimates the benefit of influenza vaccination by calculating the number of illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that are prevented by vaccination. CDC uses a compartmental model to estimate the burden that would have occurred without vaccination and the burden that occurred with vaccination 8 . The difference between these two estimates is the vaccine prevented burden. During the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – April 30, 2024), influenza vaccine coverage ranged from 37% among those 18–49 years to 73% among older adults ≥65 years (FluVaxView: Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard ) Influenza vaccine effectiveness in outpatient settings ranged from 34% to 64% depending on age group 9 . For the 2023–2024 season, CDC preliminarily estimates that influenza vaccination prevented between 7.4 million-15 million symptomatic illnesses, 3.6 million-7.4 million medical visits, 100,000-240,000 hospitalizations, and 3,500-34,000) deaths.\\nBoth disease and prevented burden will be updated later in the calendar year and updated estimates will be posted to the CDC websites for disease burden and averted burden.\\nSeasonal Severity Assessment\\nEach season, CDC classifies influenza season severity at the end of each season using influenza virus activity data, including influenza-like illness, influenza hospitalization rates, and influenza deaths to compare to the same data from past seasons and to classify the severity of the influenza season 10 . Severity is classified across all age groups and for children, adults, and older adults. The severity of the 2023–2024 season was classified as moderately severe across all age groups and for children, adults, and older adults.\\nInfluenza Activity in the Southern Hemisphere\\nInfluenza follows a seasonal pattern in Southern Hemisphere countries, with activity usually occurring between April and September and sometimes lasting until October or November. Based on data collected and submitted by countries to the World Health Organization's FluNet system 11 , as of late-August 2024, influenza activity peaked and is declining in most Southern Hemisphere countries in South America, while activity in countries in Southern Africa and Oceania persists. In South America and Australia (which provides most of the data for the Oceania region), most influenza virus detections reported this season have been influenza A(H3N2) viruses, except in Ecuador where influenza B predominated. In Southern Africa, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have predominated, though influenza B detections have increased in recent weeks.\\nIn comparison to seasonal influenza trends observed before the COVID-19 pandemic, three South American countries—Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay—reported data suggesting an earlier start to their 2024 influenza seasons while the remaining countries reported timing of activity similar to what was observed before the COVID-19 pandemic. Most countries in South America, Southern Africa, and Oceania have had influenza activity reach moderate levels, in line with levels observed in prior seasons, though two countries experienced very high influenza virus detection levels: Chile and Zambia driven by circulation of A(H3N2) and co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses, respectively. Influenza virus detections among individuals with severe acute respiratory infections (i.e., SARI cases, defined as a hospitalized case reporting a cough and fever, with symptom onset in the last 10 days) reached very high levels in Chile and Zambia, and high levels in Uruguay, Ecuador, and South Africa 12 13 .\\nOf note, Ghana, Senegal, and Lao People's Democratic Republic, which are tropical countries in the Northern Hemisphere, have reported higher levels of influenza detections than expected for this time of year compared to seasonal influenza trends observed before the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nDiscussion\\nThe 2023–2024 influenza season in the United States is considered moderately severe with an estimate of at least 34 million symptomatic illnesses, 15 million medical visits, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000 deaths caused by influenza virus infection. The predominant influenza virus overall during the 2023–2024 influenza season was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. However, as A(H1N1)pdm09 activity declined, A(H3N2) and B/Victoria virus activity continued to increase for several more weeks and, each were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from early March until mid-May. From June through August, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses co-circulated and influenza B viruses were reported in small numbers. Eight of the previous 25 seasons (1997–98 through 2022–2023, excluding the 2020–2021 season due to low influenza virus circulation), were characterized by A(H1N1) as the predominant virus (5 were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3 were the older A(H1N1) viruses); the predominant virus was influenza A(H3N2) during 16 seasons and equal proportions A(H1N1) and B in one season. Eleven seasons during this 25-year time period had two waves of influenza activity; influenza B was responsible for the second wave in 8 (73%) of those seasons (seven following A(H3N2) activity and one following A(H1N1) activity). Three seasons had a second wave of influenza A activity (two A(H3N2) and one A(H1N1)pdm09, all occurring since the 2018–2019 season.\\nMost (75% – 100%) of the influenza viruses genetically and antigenically characterized were in the same genetic subclade as, and antigenically similar to, the vaccine reference viruses included in the season's influenza vaccine. Almost all (>99.7%) of the influenza viruses collected and tested for antiviral resistance by CDC, were susceptible to zanamivir, peramivir, oseltamivir, and baloxavir .\\nThe level of influenza activity this season and during the 2022–2023 influenza season was more similar to those seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic than what was observed in the two seasons immediately after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (2020–2021 and 2021–2022). The peak percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza (18.3%) as reported to CDC from clinical laboratories nationally was slightly less than the average peak percentage positive (26.5%) during the five influenza seasons (2015–2016 – 2019–2020) immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, but this could be influenced by the addition of another virus causing significant respiratory illness. Compared to the most recent pre-COVID seasons, the cumulative rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations as reported in FluSurv-NET this season was higher than all but one season (2017–2018 season).\\nMortality attributed to influenza this season also was similar to the 2022–2023 influenza season and to what was seen in the most recent pre-COVID seasons. The peak percentage of deaths this season (1.4%) was slightly less than the 2022–2023 season (1.6%), but much more similar to pre-pandemic levels than the 2020–2021 (0.05%) and 2021–2022 seasons (0.2%). The number of pediatric deaths reported this season (197) is the second highest number of pediatric deaths attributed to influenza since the 2004–2005 season, excluding the 2009 influenza pandemic, when it became a nationally notifiable condition. The highest number of reported pediatric deaths due to influenza occurred during the 2019–20 season (199).\\nFor the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of peak influenza activity occurred within the range of what was expected based on pre-COVID-19 activity (more than 80% of seasons between 1997–98 and 2019–20 peaked between late December and late February) and activity returned to low levels by mid-May. During the 2022–2023 season, influenza activity peaked earlier than expected (early December) and the 2021–2022 season continued longer than expected (through mid-June).\\nWhile not always a predictor of the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season, Southern Hemisphere activity in the summer is often considered when planning for what could be expected during the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season. However, due to continued varied influenza activity among Southern Hemisphere countries, different influenza viruses predominating in different parts of the world, and the possibility of variations in population immunity between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, Southern Hemisphere activity cannot be used to definitively predict the timing or intensity of influenza activity in the United States this fall and winter.\\nThough influenza activity has remained low in the summer, maintaining vigilance for influenza virus infections in the United States year-round is important. Sporadic seasonal influenza virus infections and novel influenza A virus infections associated with exposure to swine during animal exhibitions often are reported during the summer months 6 . In addition, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus continue among dairy cows, poultry, and other animals, so it is important that providers and persons with exposure to sick or infected birds, cows, or other livestock remain attentive to any new symptoms, including conjunctivitis, that could be consistent with influenza virus infection 6 . Patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should isolate at home away from household members and not go to work or school until they are proven not to be infected with a novel influenza A virus or have recovered from their illness. Specimens from patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should be collected and referred to state public health departments for testing and treatment with influenza antiviral medications should be initiated immediately 14 15 .\\nWhile we do not know exactly what the coming influenza season will look like, influenza causes a significant public health burden in the United States every winter. For persons aged ≥6 months, receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences. There are also everyday preventive actions, including avoiding close contact with people who are sick, limiting contact with others if sick, and covering coughs and sneezes, that can help reduce the spread of influenza. Influenza antiviral drugs are another way to minimize the impact of influenza this coming season. CDC recommends initiating influenza antiviral drug treatment as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at increased risk for influenza-associated complications 15 . Four influenza antiviral drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration are currently recommended for use in the United States.\\nInfluenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly( Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report ) Additional information regarding influenza viruses, surveillance, vaccines, antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available online ( Influenza (Flu) ).\\nContributors: A Colón, MPH.

The flu is distinguished from the \\\"stomach flu,\\\" which is a gastrointestinal illness, and varies in severity from mild to potentially life-threatening diseases.\\n\\n### **Symptoms of Influenza:**\\nFlu symptoms typically occur suddenly and can include:\\n- Fever and chills\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Muscle or body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Fatigue (tiredness)\\n- Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\nSymptoms may differ in severity and some people might experience all symptoms, while others may have only a few.\\n\\n### **Causes of Influenza:**\\nInfluenza is caused by various influenza viruses, with types A and B responsible for seasonal flu epidemics. The virus spreads mainly through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.\\n\\n### **Risk Factors:**\\nCertain individuals are at a greater risk of developing serious complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially younger than 5 years)\\n- Adults aged 65 and older\\n- Pregnant individuals\\n- Anyone with chronic health issues (diabetes, asthma, heart disease)\\n- Immunocompromised individuals\\n\\n### **Complications:**\\nPotential complications of the flu can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Sinus infections\\n- Worsening of chronic health conditions\\n\\nIn severe cases, hospitalization or even death can occur, particularly in vulnerable populations.\\n\\n### **Diagnosis:**\\nThe diagnosis of the flu typically involves a healthcare provider evaluating medical history and symptoms, often accompanied by diagnostic tests, such as swabs taken from the nasal passage to detect the virus.\\n\\n### **Treatment:**\\nTreatment strategies may include:\\n- Antiviral medications (e.g., Oseltamivir [Tamiflu], Zanamivir, Peramivir), particularly if started within 48 hours of symptom onset.\\n- Over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms (e.g., pain relievers, decongestants).\\n- Home care through rest and increased fluid intake.\\n\\n### **Prevention:**\\nPrevention methods include:\\n- **Vaccination:** Annual flu vaccines are recommended for most people over the age of 6 months.\\n- **Hygiene Practices:** Regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when symptomatic.\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes, and disinfecting commonly-touched surfaces.\\n\\n### **Mortality and Morbidity:**\\nOn average, seasonal flu can lead to tens of thousands of deaths annually in the U.S. alone. Vaccination significantly helps reduce the risk of severe complications.\\n\\n### **Conclusion:**\\nInfluenza remains a significant public health concern that requires attention, particularly among at-risk populations.

Influenza activity in the United States during the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024) was moderately severe and within the range seen during pre-COVID-19 seasons for both timing and intensity of activity. During the 2023–2024 season, influenza activity began to increase in early November and peaked in late December 2023. Activity declined for a few weeks in January 2024 and then remained relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 before declining to inter-seasonal levels in May 2024. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus circulating during the 2023–2024 season. However, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses later in the season as overall influenza activity began to decrease. This is the third season in a row without influenza B/Yamagata viruses in circulation.\\nThis report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024) as reported to CDC through its collaborative efforts with clinical and public health laboratories, outpatient providers, emergency departments, hospitals, vital statistics offices, and public health departments. It also includes the composition of the Northern Hemisphere 2024–2025 influenza vaccines and a brief update on influenza activity occurring during the summer of 2024 in the Southern Hemisphere.\\nVirus Surveillance\\nThe influenza virologic surveillance system is comprised of the U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating laboratories and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories, which include both clinical and public health laboratories throughout the United States. Clinical laboratories primarily test for diagnostic purposes and their data are used to understand timing and intensity of influenza activity, while public health laboratories primarily test specimens for influenza for surveillance purposes to understand what influenza virus subtypes and lineages are circulating and the ages of people that are infected 1 . During the 2023–2024 influenza season, clinical laboratories reporting to CDC tested 3,910,204 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses using clinical diagnostic tests. Among these, 351,460 (9.0%) specimens tested positive, including 243,048 (69.2%) for influenza A and 108,401 (30.8%) for influenza B viruses. The overall percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza nationally each week ranged from 0.4% to 18.3% and peaked during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) before declining slightly and remaining relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 (Figure 1). The timing of peak activity for influenza A and influenza B varied (late December and late February, respectively) which contributed to the sustained period of elevated activity overall.\\nBased on the percentage of specimens testing positive in clinical laboratories, peak influenza activity in the 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions occurred between mid-December 2023 and late February 2024: HHS Regions 9 and 10 (West Coast and Pacific Northwest) peaked in mid-December; Regions 2, 3, 4, and 8 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Mountain) peaked in late December; Region 6 (South Central) peaked late in January; Region 1 (New England) peaked in early February; and Regions 5 and 7 (Midwest and Central) peaked late in February.\\nFigure 1.

Among 25,906 seasonal influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 16,875 (65.1%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 9,031 (34.9%) were influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Influenza B lineage information was available for 8,010 (87.1%) influenza B viruses, with all of them belonging to the Victoria lineage (Figure 2). No influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses have been identified worldwide since March 2020.\\nFigure 2. Influenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories*, National Summary, 2023–2024 Season\\nView Larger\\nInfluenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories*, National Summary, 2023–2024 Season\\n*This graph reflects the number of specimens tested and the number determined to be positive for influenza viruses at the public health lab (specimens tested is not the same as cases). It does not reflect specimens tested only at CDC and could include more than one specimen tested per person. Specimens tested as part of routine influenza surveillance as well as those tested as part of targeted testing for people exposed to influenza A(H5) are included. The guidance for influenza A/H5 testing recommends testing both a conjunctival and respiratory swab for people with conjunctivitis which has resulted in more specimens testing positive for influenza A/H5 than the number of human H5 cases. For more information on the number of people infected with A/H5, please visit the \\\" How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation \\\"\\nNationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus during the 2023–2024 influenza season as a whole and for each week from early November 2023 through the end of February 2024. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses co-circulated at lower levels during that time. However, as overall influenza activity decreased, A(H3N2) or B viruses were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. The co-circulation of these strains likely contributed to extending the duration of the season, with A(H3N2) and B viruses increasing as A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses decreased and A(H3N2) viruses taking over as the predominant virus in early April 2024 (Figure 2). On a regional level, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant during the season as a whole in all 10 HHS regions; however, the extent and timing of A(H3N2) and B viruses varied by region. For additional regional level data, please visit FluView Interactive.\\nAmong the influenza A viruses that were subtyped, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common virus among all age groups comprising 68.8% of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses identified in persons aged 0–4 years, 63.8% in 5–24 years, 66.0% in 25–64 years, and 63.6% in those aged 65 years or older. However, the second most frequently identified virus varied by age group: influenza B in those 0–4 and 5–24 years old, influenza A(H3N2) in those 65 years and older and approximately equal proportions of influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses in those 25–64 years.\\nVirus Characterization & Antiviral Susceptibility\\nGenetic characterization of the viruses circulating during this time period was conducted using next generation sequencing, and the genomic data were analyzed and submitted to publicly accessible databases (GenBank: GenBank Overview and EpiFlu: Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2025 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season announced ). Phylogenies of representative subsets of genetic data from CDC and other submitters can be visualized in real time at Nextstrain .\\nTo evaluate whether genetic changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) of circulating viruses affected antigenicity, antigenic characterizations were conducted using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2 and B viruses) or High-content Imaging-based micro-Neutralization Test ( HINT ) (A(H3N2) viruses) and post-infection ferret antisera raised to reference viruses representing the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses. Both assays determine how well antibodies raised to the influenza vaccine reference viruses recognize or bind to circulating viruses. HI assay measures how well antibodies inhibit the binding between the HA of the virus and the sialic acid receptors on the surface of red blood cells, whereas HINT measures how well antibodies neutralize or block virus infection of a cell.\\nCDC genetically characterized 5,348 viruses (3,865 influenza A and 1,483 influenza B) collected in the United States during October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, and antigenically characterized viruses representing various genetic clades. Overall, the vaccine antigens for each of the three major groups of the influenza viruses circulating in people (i.e., A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria) elicited antibodies that reacted well with most of the co-circulating viruses during this period (Figure 3). Detailed characterization data for each group are bellow.\\nInfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09\\nPhylogenetic analysis of the HA demonstrated that all viruses tested belonged to the 6B.1A.5a lineage and were classified in 2 clades. Clade 5a.2a represented 24.4% (n=480), and 75.6% (n=1,491) were clade 5a.2a.1. The A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines contain HA genes from clade 5a.2a.1. Nearly all (99.8%, n=573) of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were well recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses which represent the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\\nInfluenza A(H3N2)\\nAll 1,894 genetically characterized A(H3N2) viruses belonged to subclades of the 3C.2a1b.2a clade, with the majority (99.8%, n=1,891) belonging to the 2a.3a.1 subclade. The A(H3N2) component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines contain HA genes from the 3C.2a1b.2a clade. Antigenic analysis showed that 629 (95.0%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI or HINT by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses that represent the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\\nInfluenza B\\nAll influenza B viruses for which characterization was possible belonged to the B/Victoria-lineage. Infections with B/Yamagata viruses have not been identified globally since March of 2020. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes showed that all (n=1,483) belonged to clade V1A.3a.2. The genetic clade of the B/Victoria-lineage component for the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines is this V1A.3a.2 clade.\\nFigure 3. Genetic Clades of HA genes Based on Phylogenic Analysis of Influenza Viruses Collected Since October 1, 2023\\nView Larger\\nGenetic Clades of HA genes Based on Phylogenic Analysis of Influenza Viruses Collected Since October 1, 2023\\nCDC also assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral medications. Between October 1, 2023, and August 31, 2024, a total of 5,163 viruses collected in the United States were characterized for susceptibility to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors using sequence-based analysis, and a subset of 478 viruses (9.3%) were tested using a functional assay. Based on sequence analysis, all viruses, except 10, lacked known or suspected mutations associated with reduced inhibition by the neuraminidase inhibitors. Of these 10 viruses, 5 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses contained an NA-H275Y amino acid substitution and 1 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had a combination of NA substitutions I223V + S247N. The remaining 4 viruses were from B/Victoria lineage; two of them had a new substitution NA-A245G; one had NA-D197N; and 1 virus had NA-H273Y substitution. All viruses lacking NA mutations displayed normal inhibition by the neuraminidase inhibitors. As expected, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses containing NA-H275Y showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with substitutions I223V + S247N showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Two B/Victoria viruses with NA-A245G showed reduced inhibition by peramivir. One B/Victoria virus with NA-D197N showed reduced inhibition by peramivir and zanamivir, while another B/Victoria virus with NA-H273Y showed highly reduced inhibition by peramivir.\\nA total of 5,069 viruses were characterized for susceptibility to the polymerase acidic (PA) cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using sequence-based analysis, and a subset of 585 viruses (11.5%) were tested phenotypically. All tested viruses were susceptible to baloxavir, except 1 A(H3N2) virus with a PA-I38T amino acid substitution, which showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.\\nTable 1.

The A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria lineage and B/Yamagata lineage components are unchanged from the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. Both the egg-based and cell- or recombinant-based vaccines had a change in the A(H3N2) component. In the egg-based vaccine it was changed to an A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus and in cell- or recombinant-based vaccines it was changed to an A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus 2 3 . The genetic clade and subclade for the recommended vaccine viruses were 5a.2a.1 for A(H1N1)pdm09, 3C.2a1b.2a.3a.1 for A(H3N2), V1A.3a.2 for B/Victoria, and Y3 for B/Yamagata.\\nDue to the lack of detections of circulating B/Yamagata lineage viruses worldwide after March 2020, FDA further recommended vaccines manufactured for the U.S. population for the 2024–2025 season be trivalent, including only one B component from the B/Victoria lineage 4 .\\nTable 2.

Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be understood, and appropriate public health measures can be taken 1 .\\nFrom October 1, 2023, through August 31, 2024, a total of 21 novel influenza A virus infections were reported to CDC (Figure 4). Of the 21 novel influenza A virus infections reported, 14 avian influenza A (H5) virus detections in people were reported from 4 states (1-TX, 2-MI,10-CO, 1-MO). Four of the 14 cases were associated with exposure to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 infected dairy cattle, 9 were associated with poultry culling operations, and one case did not have a determined source. All 14 cases occurred in adults, 13 reported mild illness, and one patient with underlying medical conditions was hospitalized at the time the specimen for influenza testing was collected. All have recovered from their illness. No human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A (H5) viruses was identified associated with these cases.\\nCurrently in the United States, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in wild birds, and there have been outbreaks among other animals including commercial poultry, backyard flocks, and dairy cows. Sporadic infections in wild mammals also have been reported by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 5 . The first detections of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in dairy cows and unpasteurized milk samples from cows in Texas and Kansas were reported by USDA on March 25, 2024. As of August 31, 2024, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in 201 dairy herds from 14 states. Since 2022, HPAI A(H5) virus has been detected in commercial and backyard flocks in 48 states and has impacted over 100 million birds 5 . Updates on surveillance activities and symptom monitoring among persons exposed to animals infected with H5N1 are available at: How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation .\\nCDC recommends that state and local public health departments monitor people who are exposed to birds or other animals (including livestock) suspected to be infected with avian influenza A viruses for signs and symptoms consistent with influenza virus infection until 10 days after their last exposure and that people who develop illness be tested for influenza and treated with antiviral medication if indicated 6 . During February 9, 2022 — August 31, 2024, over 14,100 people were monitored following exposure to HPAI A(H5N1) virus infected birds, cows, or other animals.\\nOf the 21 novel influenza A virus infections reported during the 2023–2024 season, 7 were confirmed to be variant viruses (i.e., a swine influenza virus identified in a human and designated with a \\\"v\\\"). One H1N1v (OH), 4 H1N2v (PA), and 2 H3N2v (1-CO, 1-MI) virus infections were detected and reported to CDC. Among the 7 individuals infected with variant influenza viruses, 6 had documented swine exposure prior to illness, and for one the investigation did not determine a source. Among the 7 cases, 4 were hospitalized, and all recovered from their illness. Three were children <18 years old, and 4 were adults. No human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses was identified associated with these cases.\\nFigure 4.

Nationally, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for ILI recorded in ILINet was at or above the national baseline of 2.9% for 22 consecutive weeks from late October 2023 to late March 2024 and peaked at 6.9% during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) (Figure 5). The timing and peak percentage of visits for ILI during the 2023–2024 season were within the range of what was reported during seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be attributable to respiratory virus circulation and healthcare seeking behavior that was more similar to pre-COVID seasons than what occurred during the 2020–2021, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023 seasons.\\nOn a regional level, 8 of 10 HHS regions reported ILI activity that peaked during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52); however, Region 6 (South Central) peaked during the week ending December 23, 2023 (week 51) and Region 7 (Central) peaked during the week ending February 24, 2024 (week 8). The number of weeks of elevated activity (weeks above the region-specific baseline) varied slightly by region: Region 1 (New England) was above baseline for 23 weeks; Regions 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 4 (Southeast), 5 (Midwest), 6 (South Central), and 7 (Central) were above baseline for 20-21 weeks; Regions 2 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands), 8 (Mountain) and 9 (Pacific) were above baseline for 17-18 weeks; and Region 10 (Pacific Northwest) was above baseline for 14 weeks. Multiple respiratory viruses co-circulated during the 2023–2024 season and the contribution of influenza viruses to ILI likely varied by week and location.\\nFigure 5.

Both pediatric age groups (0–4 years and 5–24 years) had a higher percentage of visits for ILI compared to the adult age groups throughout the season. Peak activity among those 5–24 years occurred during the week ending December 23, 2023, while activity in all other age groups occurred during the week ending December 30, 2023 (Figure 6).\\nFigure 6. Percentage of Outpatient Visits by Age Group for Respiratory Illness as Reported by ILINet — United States, October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024\\nView Larger\\nPercentage of Outpatient Visits by Age Group for Respiratory Illness as Reported by ILINet — United States, October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024\\nILINet data are used to produce weekly jurisdiction and core-based statistical area (CBSA)-level measures of ILI activity. From the 2008–2009 season through the 2018–2019 season ILI activity categories ranged from minimal to high; during the 2019–20 season the very high category was added 1 . For the weeks ending December 23, 2023–January 6, 2024, and February 10, 2024 (weeks 51-1, 6), more than 50% of the 55 jurisdictions experienced high or very high ILI activity each week, with the highest number (41; 74.5%) occurring during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52). This is similar to the peak weekly percentage of jurisdictions experiencing high of very high ILI activity during the past 2 seasons (2022–2023 [86%], 2021–2022 [58%]) and during the 2 seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019–20 [87.0%], 2018–2019 [59.3%]). For a weekly snapshot of geographic activity levels of ILI, please see FluView Interactive .\\nHospitalization Surveillance\\nCDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections through two surveillance systems: the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which covers approximately 9% of the U.S. population, and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance which consists of reports from all hospitals across the country (1).\\nFrom October 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024, a total of 25,390 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites. Hospitalization rates peaked nationally during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) at 8.9 per 100,000 population. This is the third highest weekly rate observed during all seasons going back to 2010–2011 (Figure 7). This season follows the 2017–2018 season which peaked at 10.2 per 100,000 during the week ending January 6, 2018 (week 1) and the 2014–2015 season which peaked at 9.0 per 100,000 during the week ending December 27, 2014 (week 52).\\nFigure 7.

Data from the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. Hospitalization rates are updated weekly as data becomes available.\\n**In 2021–2022, rates reflect cases hospitalized beginning October 1, 2021 (MMWR Week 39), but given late influenza season activity, the season was extended to June 11, 2022 (MMWR Week 23). In 2023–2024, surveillance was extended beyond April 30 for situational awareness during the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus among birds, poultry, dairy cattle, and other animals in the United States.\\nThe overall cumulative hospitalization rate through April 27, 2024 (to coincide with when FluSurv-NET surveillance typically ends) was 83.1 per 100,000 population. Since the 2009–2010 season, this is the second highest cumulative rate based, (Figure 8).\\nFigure 8. Cumulative Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations — United States, 2014–2015 to 2023–2024 influenza seasons\\nView Larger\\nCumulative Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations — United States, 2014–2015 to 2023–2024 influenza seasons\\n*In 2021–2022, rates reflect cases hospitalized beginning October 1, 2021 (MMWR Week 39), but given late influenza season activity, the season was extended to June 11, 2022 (MMWR Week 23). In 2023–2024, surveillance was extended beyond April 30 for situational awareness during the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus among birds, poultry, dairy cattle, and other animals in the United States. Because surveillance for the 2023–2024 season was extended, it is recommended to not compare the cumulative rate from this season to cumulative rates from past seasons in which surveillance ended earlier.\\nAmong 25,390 influenza-associated hospitalizations, most (84.6%) were associated with influenza A virus, with 14.8% associated with influenza B virus. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 67.6% were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 32.4% were A(H3N2).\\nWhen examining rates by age, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among adults aged ≥65 years (231.0), followed by adults aged 50–64 years (98.9), children aged 0–4 years (86.1), adults aged 18–49 years (40.2), and was lowest among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years (34.3) (Figure 9). When examining age-adjusted rates by race and ethnicity, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (149.5), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (120.4), Hispanic/Latino persons (85.9), non-Hispanic White persons (65.5), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (47.5).\\nFigure 9. Cumulative Rate of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations by Age — United States, 2023–2024 influenza season\\nView Larger\\nCumulative Rate of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations by Age — United States, 2023–2024 influenza season\\nAmong 5,990 adults with information on underlying medical conditions who were hospitalized between October 1, 2023, and April 30, 2024, 94.5% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and obesity. Among 1,980 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15–49 years) with information on pregnancy status, 21.7% were pregnant. Among 1,429 hospitalized children and adolescents with information about underlying conditions, 70.7% reported at least one underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were asthma, neurologic disease, and obesity.\\nReporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance Component, the second surveillance system that tracks hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections, was between October 1, 2023, and May 4, 2024. During that time, 229,442 influenza associated hospitalizations were reported yielding a cumulative national influenza associated hospitalization rate of 69.2 per 100,000 population for the season. Hospitalizations began to increase in early November, peaking nationally during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) at 20,534 hospitalizations (6.2 hospitalizations per 100,000 population) before declining slightly and remaining relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 (Figure 10). While the peak weekly number of hospitalizations during the 2023–2024 season (20,534) was slightly lower than the peak weekly number during the 2022–2023 season (25,882), the total number of hospitalizations was higher this season (229,442) than it was during the same time period of the 2022–2023 season (209,338) due to the extended period of elevated activity this season.\\nFigure 10.

Regions 1 (New England) and 6 (South Central) peaked one week later (the week ending January 6, 2024) and Region 7 (Central) peaked during the week ending March 2, 2024 (week 9). Hospitalization rates in Regions 1 (New England), 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 5 (Midwest), and 6 (South Central) had a bimodal distribution, with smaller secondary peaks occurring in early March 2024 following the initial peak in late December and early January 2024. On a regional level, cumulative hospitalization rates ranged from 39.7 to 82.7 per 100,000 with 7 regions reporting a cumulative rate greater than 70 per 100,000. For additional details, see FluView Interactive .\\nMortality Surveillance\\nAccording to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance System 1 , during October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, a total of 2,774,168 deaths from all causes were reported nationally. Among these, 10,289 (0.4%) had influenza listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death. The weekly percentage of deaths due to influenza ranged from 0.03% to 1.3% and peaked during the week ending January 6, 2024 (week 1) (Figure 11). Influenza deaths began to increase in late November 2023, peaking in early January 2024 (week 1), and then declined. This peak occurred later in the season compared to the 2022–2023 influenza season, which peaked at 1.6% during mid-December 2022; however, it was slightly earlier than recent pre-COVID influenza seasons, which peaked between late January 2018 (2017–2018 season) and mid-March 2016 (2015–2016 season). While the peak weekly percentage of deaths due to influenza was lower during this season compared to last, the cumulative percentage of deaths due to influenza was slightly higher (0.4% during 2023–2024 compared with 0.3% during 2022–2023) due to longer duration of elevated influenza-associated mortality.\\nFigure 11. Influenza Mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, 2019–20 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\nView Larger\\nInfluenza Mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, 2019–20 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\n*Data presented are current as of September 9, 2024.\\nCDC monitors influenza-associated deaths in children younger than 18 years of age through the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System 1 . During October 1, 2023 – August 31, 2024, a total of 197 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC (Figure 12); this is nearly equal to the highest number of deaths reported during a seasonal influenza epidemic (199 deaths reported during the 2019–2020 season). Since influenza-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of influenza-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 during the 2011–2012 season to 199 during the 2019–20 season. This season, 104 of the reported deaths were associated with influenza A viruses, 90 were associated with influenza B viruses, and 3 were associated with influenza A and B virus co-infection. Of 60 influenza A viruses with a reported subtype, 44 (73.3%) were influenza A (H1N1) and 16 (26.7%) were influenza A (H3N2). Fourteen deaths associated with influenza B viruses had a lineage reported, and all were B/Victoria lineage viruses. No pediatric deaths associated with influenza B/Yamagata have been reported since the 2017–2018 season. The mean age at death was 7 years (range = 4 weeks–17 years). Location of deaths were known for all children and adolescents; most (112 [56.9%]) died after hospital admission; 56 (28.4%) died in an emergency room; and 29 (14.7%) died outside of a hospital setting. Among the 187 children and adolescents with a known medical history, 93 (49.7%) had at least one underlying medical condition associated with higher risk for developing serious influenza-related complications 7 . Among the 157 children and adolescents who were eligible for influenza vaccination (age ≥6 months at date of illness onset) and for whom vaccination status was known, 130 (82.8%) were not fully vaccinated.\\nFigure 12. Number of Influenza-Associated Pediatric Deaths by Virus Type and Week of Death, 2020–2021 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\nView Larger\\nNumber of Influenza-Associated Pediatric Deaths by Virus Type and Week of Death, 2020–2021 to 2023–2024 Seasons*\\n*Data shown are current as of September 9, 2024, and include deaths occurring until August 31, 2024. Additional pediatric deaths that occurred during this time period may continue to be reported as they are identified. The total number of deaths will be updated in FluView and on FluView Interactive as they are received.\\nInfluenza Disease Burden and Prevented Burden from Vaccination\\nCDC does not know the exact number of people who have been sick and affected by influenza viruses because influenza virus infection is not a reportable disease in most areas of the United States. However, CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the number of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occur each season 8 . Preliminary end of season estimates of influenza disease burden in the United States for the 2023–2024 season, from October 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024, show that influenza virus infection likely resulted in between 34 million–75 million symptomatic illnesses, 15 million-33 million medical visits, 380,000-900,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000-100,000 deaths. Older adults (≥65 years) accounted for 51% of hospitalizations and 68% of deaths.\\nIn addition to estimating the disease burden, CDC also estimates the benefit of influenza vaccination by calculating the number of illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that are prevented by vaccination. CDC uses a compartmental model to estimate the burden that would have occurred without vaccination and the burden that occurred with vaccination 8 . The difference between these two estimates is the vaccine prevented burden. During the 2023–2024 season (October 1, 2023 – April 30, 2024), influenza vaccine coverage ranged from 37% among those 18–49 years to 73% among older adults ≥65 years (FluVaxView: Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard ) Influenza vaccine effectiveness in outpatient settings ranged from 34% to 64% depending on age group 9 . For the 2023–2024 season, CDC preliminarily estimates that influenza vaccination prevented between 7.4 million-15 million symptomatic illnesses, 3.6 million-7.4 million medical visits, 100,000-240,000 hospitalizations, and 3,500-34,000) deaths.\\nBoth disease and prevented burden will be updated later in the calendar year and updated estimates will be posted to the CDC websites for disease burden and averted burden.\\nSeasonal Severity Assessment\\nEach season, CDC classifies influenza season severity at the end of each season using influenza virus activity data, including influenza-like illness, influenza hospitalization rates, and influenza deaths to compare to the same data from past seasons and to classify the severity of the influenza season 10 . Severity is classified across all age groups and for children, adults, and older adults. The severity of the 2023–2024 season was classified as moderately severe across all age groups and for children, adults, and older adults.\\nInfluenza Activity in the Southern Hemisphere\\nInfluenza follows a seasonal pattern in Southern Hemisphere countries, with activity usually occurring between April and September and sometimes lasting until October or November. Based on data collected and submitted by countries to the World Health Organization's FluNet system 11 , as of late-August 2024, influenza activity peaked and is declining in most Southern Hemisphere countries in South America, while activity in countries in Southern Africa and Oceania persists. In South America and Australia (which provides most of the data for the Oceania region), most influenza virus detections reported this season have been influenza A(H3N2) viruses, except in Ecuador where influenza B predominated. In Southern Africa, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have predominated, though influenza B detections have increased in recent weeks.\\nIn comparison to seasonal influenza trends observed before the COVID-19 pandemic, three South American countries—Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay—reported data suggesting an earlier start to their 2024 influenza seasons while the remaining countries reported timing of activity similar to what was observed before the COVID-19 pandemic. Most countries in South America, Southern Africa, and Oceania have had influenza activity reach moderate levels, in line with levels observed in prior seasons, though two countries experienced very high influenza virus detection levels: Chile and Zambia driven by circulation of A(H3N2) and co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses, respectively. Influenza virus detections among individuals with severe acute respiratory infections (i.e., SARI cases, defined as a hospitalized case reporting a cough and fever, with symptom onset in the last 10 days) reached very high levels in Chile and Zambia, and high levels in Uruguay, Ecuador, and South Africa 12 13 .\\nOf note, Ghana, Senegal, and Lao People's Democratic Republic, which are tropical countries in the Northern Hemisphere, have reported higher levels of influenza detections than expected for this time of year compared to seasonal influenza trends observed before the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nDiscussion\\nThe 2023–2024 influenza season in the United States is considered moderately severe with an estimate of at least 34 million symptomatic illnesses, 15 million medical visits, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000 deaths caused by influenza virus infection. The predominant influenza virus overall during the 2023–2024 influenza season was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. However, as A(H1N1)pdm09 activity declined, A(H3N2) and B/Victoria virus activity continued to increase for several more weeks and, each were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from early March until mid-May. From June through August, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses co-circulated and influenza B viruses were reported in small numbers. Eight of the previous 25 seasons (1997–98 through 2022–2023, excluding the 2020–2021 season due to low influenza virus circulation), were characterized by A(H1N1) as the predominant virus (5 were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3 were the older A(H1N1) viruses); the predominant virus was influenza A(H3N2) during 16 seasons and equal proportions A(H1N1) and B in one season. Eleven seasons during this 25-year time period had two waves of influenza activity; influenza B was responsible for the second wave in 8 (73%) of those seasons (seven following A(H3N2) activity and one following A(H1N1) activity). Three seasons had a second wave of influenza A activity (two A(H3N2) and one A(H1N1)pdm09, all occurring since the 2018–2019 season.\\nMost (75% – 100%) of the influenza viruses genetically and antigenically characterized were in the same genetic subclade as, and antigenically similar to, the vaccine reference viruses included in the season's influenza vaccine. Almost all (>99.7%) of the influenza viruses collected and tested for antiviral resistance by CDC, were susceptible to zanamivir, peramivir, oseltamivir, and baloxavir .\\nThe level of influenza activity this season and during the 2022–2023 influenza season was more similar to those seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic than what was observed in the two seasons immediately after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (2020–2021 and 2021–2022). The peak percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza (18.3%) as reported to CDC from clinical laboratories nationally was slightly less than the average peak percentage positive (26.5%) during the five influenza seasons (2015–2016 – 2019–2020) immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, but this could be influenced by the addition of another virus causing significant respiratory illness. Compared to the most recent pre-COVID seasons, the cumulative rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations as reported in FluSurv-NET this season was higher than all but one season (2017–2018 season).\\nMortality attributed to influenza this season also was similar to the 2022–2023 influenza season and to what was seen in the most recent pre-COVID seasons. The peak percentage of deaths this season (1.4%) was slightly less than the 2022–2023 season (1.6%), but much more similar to pre-pandemic levels than the 2020–2021 (0.05%) and 2021–2022 seasons (0.2%). The number of pediatric deaths reported this season (197) is the second highest number of pediatric deaths attributed to influenza since the 2004–2005 season, excluding the 2009 influenza pandemic, when it became a nationally notifiable condition. The highest number of reported pediatric deaths due to influenza occurred during the 2019–20 season (199).\\nFor the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of peak influenza activity occurred within the range of what was expected based on pre-COVID-19 activity (more than 80% of seasons between 1997–98 and 2019–20 peaked between late December and late February) and activity returned to low levels by mid-May. During the 2022–2023 season, influenza activity peaked earlier than expected (early December) and the 2021–2022 season continued longer than expected (through mid-June).\\nWhile not always a predictor of the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season, Southern Hemisphere activity in the summer is often considered when planning for what could be expected during the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season. However, due to continued varied influenza activity among Southern Hemisphere countries, different influenza viruses predominating in different parts of the world, and the possibility of variations in population immunity between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, Southern Hemisphere activity cannot be used to definitively predict the timing or intensity of influenza activity in the United States this fall and winter.\\nThough influenza activity has remained low in the summer, maintaining vigilance for influenza virus infections in the United States year-round is important. Sporadic seasonal influenza virus infections and novel influenza A virus infections associated with exposure to swine during animal exhibitions often are reported during the summer months 6 . In addition, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus continue among dairy cows, poultry, and other animals, so it is important that providers and persons with exposure to sick or infected birds, cows, or other livestock remain attentive to any new symptoms, including conjunctivitis, that could be consistent with influenza virus infection 6 . Patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should isolate at home away from household members and not go to work or school until they are proven not to be infected with a novel influenza A virus or have recovered from their illness. Specimens from patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should be collected and referred to state public health departments for testing and treatment with influenza antiviral medications should be initiated immediately 14 15 .\\nWhile we do not know exactly what the coming influenza season will look like, influenza causes a significant public health burden in the United States every winter. For persons aged ≥6 months, receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences. There are also everyday preventive actions, including avoiding close contact with people who are sick, limiting contact with others if sick, and covering coughs and sneezes, that can help reduce the spread of influenza. Influenza antiviral drugs are another way to minimize the impact of influenza this coming season. CDC recommends initiating influenza antiviral drug treatment as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at increased risk for influenza-associated complications 15 . Four influenza antiviral drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration are currently recommended for use in the United States.\\nInfluenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly( Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report ) Additional information regarding influenza viruses, surveillance, vaccines, antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available online ( Influenza (Flu) ).\\nContributors: A Colón, MPH.

While often confused with the \\\"stomach flu,\\\" influenza is distinct and can range in severity from mild to potentially life-threatening. The flu remains a significant public health concern, particularly during seasonal epidemics, affecting millions globally.\\n\\n## **Symptoms of Influenza**\\nFlu symptoms typically manifest suddenly and encompass a range of indicators, including:\\n- **Fever and chills**: Commonly experienced, although some individuals may not exhibit a fever.\\n- **Cough**: Often a dry cough that may worsen.\\n- **Sore throat**: A common complaint that can cause discomfort.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: Nasal congestion is frequently reported.\\n- **Muscle or body aches**: Generalized pain is typical.\\n- **Headaches**: Can vary in intensity but is a common symptom.\\n- **Fatigue (tiredness)**: A persistent feeling of exhaustion that can last for weeks.\\n- **Vomiting and diarrhea**: More prevalent in children, these gastrointestinal symptoms can accompany the flu.\\n\\nIndividuals may experience varying combinations of these symptoms, with some only suffering mild discomfort, while others can suffer severely.\\n\\n## **Causes of Influenza**\\nInfluenza is primarily caused by types A and B virus subtypes, which account for seasonal flu epidemics. The virus spreads easily through:\\n- **Respiratory droplets**: Transmitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.\\n- **Contaminated surfaces**: Touching surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus and then touching the face can lead to infection.\\n\\n## **Risk Factors**\\nCertain groups are at heightened risk for severe complications from the flu, including:\\n- **Young children**: Especially those under the age of 5.\\n- **Adults aged 65 and older**: This demographic often experiences more severe health issues.\\n- **Pregnant individuals**: They are more susceptible to complications.\\n- **Chronic health conditions**: Such as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease can exacerbate flu symptoms.\\n- **Immunocompromised individuals**: Those with weakened immune systems are at greater risk.\\n\\n## **Complications**\\nPotential complications from flu may include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: A severe lung infection that can be life-threatening.\\n- **Bronchitis**: Inflammation of the bronchial tubes can occur.\\n- **Sinus infections**: Bacterial infections may develop as a secondary complication.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health conditions**: Pre-existing conditions can deteriorate due to the flu.\\n\\nIn severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary, and flu-related deaths occur, particularly among the high-risk population.\\n\\n## **Diagnosis**\\nDiagnosing influenza involves:\\n- **Medical history and symptoms evaluation**: A healthcare provider reviews symptoms and may ask about exposure to others who have flu-like symptoms.\\n- **Diagnostic tests**: Such as rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) or PCR tests which confirm the presence of flu viruses.\\n\\n## **Treatment**\\nTreatment for influenza may include:\\n- **Antiviral medications**: Such as Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Peramivir, which are most effective when initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset.\\n- **Symptomatic relief**: Over-the-counter medications for fever and pain relief can alleviate discomfort.\\n- **Home care**: Increased hydration and rest are recommended, helping the body recover from the illness.\\n\\n## **Prevention**\\nPreventative measures against influenza include:\\n- **Vaccination**: Annual flu vaccines are essential for most individuals over six months old.\\n- **Hygiene practices**: Regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when symptomatic can mitigate spread.\\n- **Respiratory etiquette**: Covering coughs and sneezes and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces play a critical role in prevention.\\n\\n## **Mortality and Morbidity**\\nAccording to continuous surveillance, seasonal influenza can result in tens of thousands of deaths annually within the U.S. Vaccination has proven effective in dramatically reducing instances of severe complications.\\n\\n## **Seasonal Severity Assessment**\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies the severity of each flu season. For the 2023-2024 season, the influenza activity is classified as moderately severe, drawing comparisons to pre-COVID-19 seasons. Recent fluctuations in peak activity have seen notable increases in hospitalization rates and mortality statistics.\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\nInfluenza continues to pose a substantial public health challenge, particularly for vulnerable populations. The combination of annual vaccinations and adherence to recommended hygiene practices offers the most effective defense against this prevalent virus.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\\n- World Health Organization (WHO)\\n- Mayo Clinic\\n- Cleveland Clinic\\n```\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"```\\nThought: I now can give a great answer\\nFinal Answer: \\n\\n# Detailed Report on Influenza (Flu)\\n\\n## **Influenza (Flu) Overview**\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect the nose, throat, and lungs.

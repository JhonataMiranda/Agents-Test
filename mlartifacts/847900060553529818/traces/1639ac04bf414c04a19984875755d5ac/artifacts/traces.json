The most common bacteria causing Lyme disease in North America is *Borrelia burgdorferi*. The disease is primarily spread to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, also known as deer ticks. Lyme disease was first identified in the 1970s when several cases of arthritis were reported in children in Lyme, Connecticut.\\n\\n## Symptoms and Stages\\nLyme disease has varying symptoms that generally develop in stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Stage (weeks 1-4)**\\n   - The most recognizable sign is a rash known as erythema migrans, which often appears at the site of a tick bite. This rash can expand and form a \\\"bull's-eye\\\" pattern, with a clear center surrounded by a red ring.\\n   - Other initial symptoms may include fever, headaches, tiredness, joint stiffness, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Stage (months 1-4)**\\n   - If not treated, the infection can spread and cause additional rashes, neurological problems (like facial paralysis known as Bell's palsy), heart issues (such as irregular heartbeat), and nerve pain.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Stage (after 4 months)**\\n   - This stage might lead to persistent arthritis, especially in larger joints like the knees. Patients could experience severe neurological complications, including problems with memory and chronic pain.\\n\\n4. **Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)**\\n   - Some individuals may continue to suffer from fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and cognitive difficulties even after treatment, which may not improve with further antibiotics.\\n\\n## Causes and Transmission\\nThe main carriers of Lyme disease are blacklegged ticks (*Ixodes scapularis*), which pass the *Borrelia* bacteria to humans when they bite. Ticks can become infected by feeding on small animals like mice, voles, and deer. The risk of contracting Lyme disease is highest during warmer months, particularly spring and summer. The disease is most prevalent in the Northeastern, Upper Midwest, and Pacific coastal areas of the United States.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease usually involves a combination of evaluating the patient's symptoms, assessing possible exposure to ticks, and conducting blood tests for antibodies against *Borrelia* bacteria. A two-step testing approach is often used: an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a confirmatory test called a western blot for positive or uncertain results.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nLyme disease is treated effectively with antibiotics. For early-stage infections, common antibiotics include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil, typically given for 10 to 21 days. In cases of late-stage Lyme with serious complications, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTaking steps to prevent Lyme disease is essential:\\n- Stay away from areas where ticks thrive, such as dense woods and tall grasses, especially during peak tick season (late spring to summer).\\n- Wear protective clothing and use insect repellents containing DEET or permethrin.\\n- Conduct thorough tick checks on yourself and pets after being outdoors.\\n- If you find a tick, remove it promptly with tweezers by grasping the tick close to the skin and pulling straight out steadily.\\n\\n## Complications and Aftercare\\nIf untreated, Lyme disease can result in serious long-term health issues like chronic arthritis, neurological problems, and heart complications. Most post-treatment symptoms will improve over time, but some people might continue to experience persistent issues that require additional support and rehabilitation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a major health concern that can lead to serious complications if not treated in a timely manner. Raising awareness and practicing effective prevention strategies are critical to reducing the risk of infection and ensuring community health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**References:**\\n1.

Post-treatment symptoms usually improve over time, although some individuals may experience persistent symptoms requiring supportive care and rehabilitation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a serious health condition that can have lasting effects if not addressed promptly with appropriate medical intervention.

The primary bacteria responsible for Lyme disease in North America is *Borrelia burgdorferi*, transmitted predominantly through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, commonly referred to as deer ticks. Lyme disease was first recognized in the 1970s after numerous cases of arthritis were reported in children living in Lyme, Connecticut.\\n\\n## Symptoms and Stages\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary and typically present in stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Stage (weeks 1-4)**\\n   - A characteristic rash known as erythema migrans often appears at the site of a tick bite. This rash may gradually expand and take on a \\\"bull's-eye\\\" appearance, with a clear center surrounded by a red ring. \\n   - Other early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, joint stiffness, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Stage (months 1-4)**\\n   - If left untreated, the infection can spread, leading to additional rashes, neurological issues like facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), heart problems (such as irregular heartbeat), and potential neuropathies.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Stage (after 4 months)**\\n   - This stage may involve persistent arthritis, particularly in large joints such as the knees. Patients may also experience more severe neurological complications, like cognitive difficulties, and chronic pain.\\n\\n4. **Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)**\\n   - Some individuals may continue to experience symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and cognitive difficulties even after treatment, which may not respond to additional antibiotics.\\n\\n## Causes and Transmission\\nThe primary vector for Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which transmits the *Borrelia* bacteria to humans during feeding. Ticks can become infected by feeding on small mammals like mice, voles, and deer. The risk of infection is highest during the warmer months when ticks are most active, and the disease is more commonly reported in the Northeastern, Upper Midwest, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Lyme disease typically involves a combination of a patient's reported symptoms, history of potential exposure to ticks, and serologic testing for antibodies against *Borrelia* bacteria. A two-tiered testing strategy is recommended, where an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is followed by a confirmatory western blot test for positive or equivocal results.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nLyme disease is effectively treated with antibiotics. Early-stage infections are commonly treated with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for a duration of 10-21 days. In cases of late-stage Lyme disease with severe complications, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be required. \\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventative measures are crucial in reducing the incidence of Lyme disease:\\n- Avoid tick habitats such as dense woods and tall grasses, especially during peak seasons (late spring through summer).\\n- Wear protective clothing and use insect repellents with DEET or permethrin.\\n- Perform thorough tick checks after potential exposure.\\n- Remove ticks promptly with tweezers by grasping the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible and pulling upward steadily.\\n\\n## Complications and Aftercare\\nWithout treatment, Lyme disease can lead to serious long-term health issues, including chronic arthritis, neurological complications, and cardiac involvement. Post-treatment symptoms usually improve over time, although some individuals may experience persistent symptoms requiring supportive care and rehabilitation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a serious health condition that can have lasting effects if not addressed promptly with appropriate medical intervention. Increased awareness and effective preventive practices are essential to reduce the risk of infection and promote community health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**References:**\\n1.

The primary bacteria responsible for Lyme disease in North America is *Borrelia burgdorferi*, transmitted predominantly through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, commonly referred to as deer ticks. Lyme disease was first recognized in the 1970s after numerous cases of arthritis were reported in children living in Lyme, Connecticut.\\n\\n## Symptoms and Stages\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary and typically present in stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Stage (weeks 1-4)**\\n   - A characteristic rash known as erythema migrans often appears at the site of a tick bite. This rash may gradually expand and take on a \\\"bull's-eye\\\" appearance, with a clear center surrounded by a red ring. \\n   - Other early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, joint stiffness, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Stage (months 1-4)**\\n   - If left untreated, the infection can spread, leading to additional rashes, neurological issues like facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), heart problems (such as irregular heartbeat), and potential neuropathies.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Stage (after 4 months)**\\n   - This stage may involve persistent arthritis, particularly in large joints such as the knees. Patients may also experience more severe neurological complications, like cognitive difficulties, and chronic pain.\\n\\n4. **Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)**\\n   - Some individuals may continue to experience symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and cognitive difficulties even after treatment, which may not respond to additional antibiotics.\\n\\n## Causes and Transmission\\nThe primary vector for Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which transmits the *Borrelia* bacteria to humans during feeding. Ticks can become infected by feeding on small mammals like mice, voles, and deer. The risk of infection is highest during the warmer months when ticks are most active, and the disease is more commonly reported in the Northeastern, Upper Midwest, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Lyme disease typically involves a combination of a patient's reported symptoms, history of potential exposure to ticks, and serologic testing for antibodies against *Borrelia* bacteria. A two-tiered testing strategy is recommended, where an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is followed by a confirmatory western blot test for positive or equivocal results.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nLyme disease is effectively treated with antibiotics. Early-stage infections are commonly treated with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for a duration of 10-21 days. In cases of late-stage Lyme disease with severe complications, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be required. \\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventative measures are crucial in reducing the incidence of Lyme disease:\\n- Avoid tick habitats such as dense woods and tall grasses, especially during peak seasons (late spring through summer).\\n- Wear protective clothing and use insect repellents with DEET or permethrin.\\n- Perform thorough tick checks after potential exposure.\\n- Remove ticks promptly with tweezers by grasping the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible and pulling upward steadily.\\n\\n## Complications and Aftercare\\nWithout treatment, Lyme disease can lead to serious long-term health issues, including chronic arthritis, neurological complications, and cardiac involvement. Post-treatment symptoms usually improve over time, although some individuals may experience persistent symptoms requiring supportive care and rehabilitation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a serious health condition that can have lasting effects if not addressed promptly with appropriate medical intervention. Increased awareness and effective preventive practices are essential to reduce the risk of infection and promote community health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**References:**\\n1.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

What is Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi , which you can get if an infected deer tick (also called black-legged tick) bites you. Ordinary \\\"wood ticks\\\" and \\\"dog ticks\\\" don’t carry the infection. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy The first recognition of Lyme disease, also called borreliosis, began in 1975 when many children received a diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Lyme, Connecticut, and two neighboring towns. Researchers found that bites from infected deer ticks were responsible for the outbreak of arthritis. What are the stages (phases) of Lyme disease? Lyme disease may evolve through phases (stages), which can overlap and cause symptoms that may involve the skin, joints, heart or nervous system. These stages are: Early localized Lyme disease (weeks one through four). Early disseminated Lyme disease (months one through four). Late persistent, late disseminated or just late Lyme disease (after four months, even up to years later). How common is Lyme disease? In the United States, about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year. But there are other, diagnosed cases that aren't reported. Signs and Symptoms What are the symptoms of Lyme disease? Signs and symptoms of early Lyme disease typically include: A reddish ras h or skin lesion known as erythema migraines (EM). The rash starts as a small red spot at the site of the tick bite anywhere from one week after to four weeks after the bite. The spot expands over a period of days or weeks, forming a circular, triangular or oval-shaped rash. The rash may look like a bull’s eye because it appears as a red ring that surrounds a clear center area. The rash can range in size from that of a dime to the entire width of a person's back. As infection spreads, several EM rashes (lesions) can appear at different sites on your body. Fever . Headache . Stiff neck. Body and joint aches. Fatigue . Swollen lymph nodes (swollen glands). Advertisement Signs and symptoms of the second stage of Lyme disease (the early disseminated stage) may include: Multiple areas of rash. Paralysis of facial muscles ( Bell's palsy ). Heart block or an interruption of the electrical system of the heart. Areas of numbness or abnormal feelings ( neuropathy ). Signs and symptoms of untreated late Lyme disease, which may happen from months to a year after infection, may include: Recurring episodes of swollen joints ( arthritis ). This typically affects large joints like the knee. Difficulty concentrating, known as “brain fog.” This is a form of encephalopathy or damage to the brain. Damage to nerves all over your body, including your skin, muscles and organs (polyneuropathy). Diagnosis and Tests How is Lyme disease diagnosed? A healthcare provider will diagnose Lyme disease based on symptoms, physical findings (like a rash) and whether or not you've been in an area populated by infected ticks. Many people don’t remember or know that they’ve been bitten by a tick. This is because the tick is tiny, and its bite is usually painless. Your provider will confirm the diagnosis using a blood test. If your first blood test is negative for Lyme disease, you won't need another test. If the first test is positive or equivocal, your provider will conduct the test again. You have to have two positive (or sometimes equivocal) results to be diagnosed with Lyme disease. Management and Treatment How is Lyme disease treated? Antibiotics , usually doxycycline or amoxicillin, are effective treatments for Lyme disease. How long your treatment lasts depends on the stage of infection. In general, it’s true that the sooner you’re treated, the quicker and more complete the recovery. Pregnant women should receive treatment for Lyme disease as well. There is, however, no evidence that a fetus can get the infection from its birth mother. There’s also no strong evidence that miscarriages are more likely after Lyme disease. What should I do if a tick bites me? If a tick bites you, the best way to remove it is by taking the following steps: Tug gently but firmly with blunt tweezers near the \\\"head\\\" of the tick at the level of your skin until it releases its hold on your skin. Avoid crushing the tick's body or handling the tick with bare fingers because you could expose yourself to the bacteria in the tick. Wash the bite area thoroughly with soap and water. Don't use kerosene, petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline®) or hot cigarette butts to remove the tick. Don't squeeze the tick's body with your fingers or tweezers. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can Lyme disease be prevented? Most people with Lyme disease get the infection during the late spring, summer and early fall when immature ticks are out feeding. In warm climates, few tick bites take place during winter months. Advertisement Deer ticks are most often found in wooded areas and nearby grasslands. They’re especially common where the two areas merge, including neighborhood yards where deer occasionally roam. Ticks don’t survive long on sunny lawns. They dry out quickly and die. Although only about 1% of all deer ticks carry Lyme disease-causing bacteria, there are areas in which over 50% of the ticks carry the bacterium. The diseased ticks are often found in the U.S. Northeast and upper Midwest areas. Ticks also live in coastal areas. Black-legged ticks can get the infection from animals other than deer. Mice, voles and some squirrels can carry the bacteria. How can I prevent tick bites? The following tips can help you avoid tick bites: To repel ticks, you may want to spray your clothing with permethrin, an insecticide commonly found in lawn and garden stores. Insect repellents that contain a chemical called DEET can also be applied to clothing or directly onto your skin. Read the labels carefully. Don’t overuse it. Too much may be harmful. Minimize skin exposure to both ticks and insect repellents by wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts that fit tightly at the ankles and wrists. Wear a hat, tuck your pant legs into socks and wear shoes that leave no part of your feet exposed. Wear light-colored clothing to make it easier to detect ticks. Walk in the center of trails to avoid picking up ticks from overhanging grass and brush. After outdoor activities in an \\\"at risk\\\" area, always do a tick check and then shower, scrubbing with a washcloth. Get rid of any ticks on your clothes by putting them in the dryer for 15 minutes. This will kill any ticks attached to the clothes by drying them out. Pets may bring ticks into your home. Discuss ways to prevent ticks on your pet with your veterinarian. Advertisement Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for someone with Lyme disease? Most of the people who get Lyme disease and receive treatment early will be fine. Treatment can cure Lyme disease but you might still have some long-term effects. Untreated Lyme disease may contribute to other serious problems but it’s rarely fatal. Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome Even after proper treatment, some people (estimated at 5% to 15%) may experience lingering fatigue, achiness or headaches. This is known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome or PTLDS. The symptoms don’t mean that you still have an infection. PTLDS probably won’t respond to additional antibiotics. The majority of people in this group will have symptoms that resolve at some point over the next six months. Chronic Lyme disease Chronic Lyme disease is a term used by some for a condition in a person who had Lyme disease and the symptoms of PTLDS. Some people consider chronic Lyme disease to be the same as PTLDS. However, some people receive a chronic Lyme disease diagnosis without a Lyme disease diagnosis. Sometimes, extended treatment with antibiotics helps. This term may be why some people think a Lyme disease infection can occur without being bitten by a tick. There isn't enough proof that mosquitoes can transmit Lyme disease. Many researchers dislike using the term “chronic Lyme disease.” Advertisement Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? If you feel sick after having spent time in areas where ticks might live, you should make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If you received a Lyme disease diagnosis and you don’t feel well after taking all of your antibiotics, contact your provider. This is especially true if you have symptoms like a stiff neck or mental confusion. Additional Common Questions Can Lyme disease completely be cured? Taking oral antibiotics typically cures Lyme disease after two to four weeks. You may need to get antibiotics through the vein (intravenously) for four more weeks. However, there’s no reason to think that Lyme disease stays in you forever after treatment. A note from Cleveland Clinic If you’re going to spend time in an area that might have ticks, take measures to avoid being bitten. This includes wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants to make it harder for ticks to bite. If you feel sick after being in an area that probably has ticks, make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If your provider prescribes antibiotics, make sure you take all of them as instructed. Care at Cleveland Clinic Cleveland Clinic’s primary care providers offer lifelong medical care.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

What is Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi , which you can get if an infected deer tick (also called black-legged tick) bites you. Ordinary \\\"wood ticks\\\" and \\\"dog ticks\\\" don’t carry the infection. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy The first recognition of Lyme disease, also called borreliosis, began in 1975 when many children received a diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Lyme, Connecticut, and two neighboring towns. Researchers found that bites from infected deer ticks were responsible for the outbreak of arthritis. What are the stages (phases) of Lyme disease? Lyme disease may evolve through phases (stages), which can overlap and cause symptoms that may involve the skin, joints, heart or nervous system. These stages are: Early localized Lyme disease (weeks one through four). Early disseminated Lyme disease (months one through four). Late persistent, late disseminated or just late Lyme disease (after four months, even up to years later). How common is Lyme disease? In the United States, about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year. But there are other, diagnosed cases that aren't reported. Signs and Symptoms What are the symptoms of Lyme disease? Signs and symptoms of early Lyme disease typically include: A reddish ras h or skin lesion known as erythema migraines (EM). The rash starts as a small red spot at the site of the tick bite anywhere from one week after to four weeks after the bite. The spot expands over a period of days or weeks, forming a circular, triangular or oval-shaped rash. The rash may look like a bull’s eye because it appears as a red ring that surrounds a clear center area. The rash can range in size from that of a dime to the entire width of a person's back. As infection spreads, several EM rashes (lesions) can appear at different sites on your body. Fever . Headache . Stiff neck. Body and joint aches. Fatigue . Swollen lymph nodes (swollen glands). Advertisement Signs and symptoms of the second stage of Lyme disease (the early disseminated stage) may include: Multiple areas of rash. Paralysis of facial muscles ( Bell's palsy ). Heart block or an interruption of the electrical system of the heart. Areas of numbness or abnormal feelings ( neuropathy ). Signs and symptoms of untreated late Lyme disease, which may happen from months to a year after infection, may include: Recurring episodes of swollen joints ( arthritis ). This typically affects large joints like the knee. Difficulty concentrating, known as “brain fog.” This is a form of encephalopathy or damage to the brain. Damage to nerves all over your body, including your skin, muscles and organs (polyneuropathy). Diagnosis and Tests How is Lyme disease diagnosed? A healthcare provider will diagnose Lyme disease based on symptoms, physical findings (like a rash) and whether or not you've been in an area populated by infected ticks. Many people don’t remember or know that they’ve been bitten by a tick. This is because the tick is tiny, and its bite is usually painless. Your provider will confirm the diagnosis using a blood test. If your first blood test is negative for Lyme disease, you won't need another test. If the first test is positive or equivocal, your provider will conduct the test again. You have to have two positive (or sometimes equivocal) results to be diagnosed with Lyme disease. Management and Treatment How is Lyme disease treated? Antibiotics , usually doxycycline or amoxicillin, are effective treatments for Lyme disease. How long your treatment lasts depends on the stage of infection. In general, it’s true that the sooner you’re treated, the quicker and more complete the recovery. Pregnant women should receive treatment for Lyme disease as well. There is, however, no evidence that a fetus can get the infection from its birth mother. There’s also no strong evidence that miscarriages are more likely after Lyme disease. What should I do if a tick bites me? If a tick bites you, the best way to remove it is by taking the following steps: Tug gently but firmly with blunt tweezers near the \\\"head\\\" of the tick at the level of your skin until it releases its hold on your skin. Avoid crushing the tick's body or handling the tick with bare fingers because you could expose yourself to the bacteria in the tick. Wash the bite area thoroughly with soap and water. Don't use kerosene, petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline®) or hot cigarette butts to remove the tick. Don't squeeze the tick's body with your fingers or tweezers. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can Lyme disease be prevented? Most people with Lyme disease get the infection during the late spring, summer and early fall when immature ticks are out feeding. In warm climates, few tick bites take place during winter months. Advertisement Deer ticks are most often found in wooded areas and nearby grasslands. They’re especially common where the two areas merge, including neighborhood yards where deer occasionally roam. Ticks don’t survive long on sunny lawns. They dry out quickly and die. Although only about 1% of all deer ticks carry Lyme disease-causing bacteria, there are areas in which over 50% of the ticks carry the bacterium. The diseased ticks are often found in the U.S. Northeast and upper Midwest areas. Ticks also live in coastal areas. Black-legged ticks can get the infection from animals other than deer. Mice, voles and some squirrels can carry the bacteria. How can I prevent tick bites? The following tips can help you avoid tick bites: To repel ticks, you may want to spray your clothing with permethrin, an insecticide commonly found in lawn and garden stores. Insect repellents that contain a chemical called DEET can also be applied to clothing or directly onto your skin. Read the labels carefully. Don’t overuse it. Too much may be harmful. Minimize skin exposure to both ticks and insect repellents by wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts that fit tightly at the ankles and wrists. Wear a hat, tuck your pant legs into socks and wear shoes that leave no part of your feet exposed. Wear light-colored clothing to make it easier to detect ticks. Walk in the center of trails to avoid picking up ticks from overhanging grass and brush. After outdoor activities in an \\\"at risk\\\" area, always do a tick check and then shower, scrubbing with a washcloth. Get rid of any ticks on your clothes by putting them in the dryer for 15 minutes. This will kill any ticks attached to the clothes by drying them out. Pets may bring ticks into your home. Discuss ways to prevent ticks on your pet with your veterinarian. Advertisement Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for someone with Lyme disease? Most of the people who get Lyme disease and receive treatment early will be fine. Treatment can cure Lyme disease but you might still have some long-term effects. Untreated Lyme disease may contribute to other serious problems but it’s rarely fatal. Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome Even after proper treatment, some people (estimated at 5% to 15%) may experience lingering fatigue, achiness or headaches. This is known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome or PTLDS. The symptoms don’t mean that you still have an infection. PTLDS probably won’t respond to additional antibiotics. The majority of people in this group will have symptoms that resolve at some point over the next six months. Chronic Lyme disease Chronic Lyme disease is a term used by some for a condition in a person who had Lyme disease and the symptoms of PTLDS. Some people consider chronic Lyme disease to be the same as PTLDS. However, some people receive a chronic Lyme disease diagnosis without a Lyme disease diagnosis. Sometimes, extended treatment with antibiotics helps. This term may be why some people think a Lyme disease infection can occur without being bitten by a tick. There isn't enough proof that mosquitoes can transmit Lyme disease. Many researchers dislike using the term “chronic Lyme disease.” Advertisement Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? If you feel sick after having spent time in areas where ticks might live, you should make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If you received a Lyme disease diagnosis and you don’t feel well after taking all of your antibiotics, contact your provider. This is especially true if you have symptoms like a stiff neck or mental confusion. Additional Common Questions Can Lyme disease completely be cured? Taking oral antibiotics typically cures Lyme disease after two to four weeks. You may need to get antibiotics through the vein (intravenously) for four more weeks. However, there’s no reason to think that Lyme disease stays in you forever after treatment. A note from Cleveland Clinic If you’re going to spend time in an area that might have ticks, take measures to avoid being bitten. This includes wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants to make it harder for ticks to bite. If you feel sick after being in an area that probably has ticks, make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If your provider prescribes antibiotics, make sure you take all of them as instructed. Care at Cleveland Clinic Cleveland Clinic’s primary care providers offer lifelong medical care.

The primary bacteria responsible for Lyme disease in North America is *Borrelia burgdorferi*, transmitted predominantly through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, commonly referred to as deer ticks. Lyme disease was first recognized in the 1970s after numerous cases of arthritis were reported in children living in Lyme, Connecticut.\\n\\n## Symptoms and Stages\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary and typically present in stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Stage (weeks 1-4)**\\n   - A characteristic rash known as erythema migrans often appears at the site of a tick bite. This rash may gradually expand and take on a \\\"bull's-eye\\\" appearance, with a clear center surrounded by a red ring. \\n   - Other early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, joint stiffness, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Stage (months 1-4)**\\n   - If left untreated, the infection can spread, leading to additional rashes, neurological issues like facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), heart problems (such as irregular heartbeat), and potential neuropathies.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Stage (after 4 months)**\\n   - This stage may involve persistent arthritis, particularly in large joints such as the knees. Patients may also experience more severe neurological complications, like cognitive difficulties, and chronic pain.\\n\\n4. **Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)**\\n   - Some individuals may continue to experience symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and cognitive difficulties even after treatment, which may not respond to additional antibiotics.\\n\\n## Causes and Transmission\\nThe primary vector for Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which transmits the *Borrelia* bacteria to humans during feeding. Ticks can become infected by feeding on small mammals like mice, voles, and deer. The risk of infection is highest during the warmer months when ticks are most active, and the disease is more commonly reported in the Northeastern, Upper Midwest, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Lyme disease typically involves a combination of a patient's reported symptoms, history of potential exposure to ticks, and serologic testing for antibodies against *Borrelia* bacteria. A two-tiered testing strategy is recommended, where an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is followed by a confirmatory western blot test for positive or equivocal results.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nLyme disease is effectively treated with antibiotics. Early-stage infections are commonly treated with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for a duration of 10-21 days. In cases of late-stage Lyme disease with severe complications, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be required. \\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventative measures are crucial in reducing the incidence of Lyme disease:\\n- Avoid tick habitats such as dense woods and tall grasses, especially during peak seasons (late spring through summer).\\n- Wear protective clothing and use insect repellents with DEET or permethrin.\\n- Perform thorough tick checks after potential exposure.\\n- Remove ticks promptly with tweezers by grasping the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible and pulling upward steadily.\\n\\n## Complications and Aftercare\\nWithout treatment, Lyme disease can lead to serious long-term health issues, including chronic arthritis, neurological complications, and cardiac involvement. Post-treatment symptoms usually improve over time, although some individuals may experience persistent symptoms requiring supportive care and rehabilitation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a serious health condition that can have lasting effects if not addressed promptly with appropriate medical intervention. Increased awareness and effective preventive practices are essential to reduce the risk of infection and promote community health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**References:**\\n1.

Lyme disease was first recognized in the 1970s after numerous cases of arthritis were reported in children living in Lyme, Connecticut.\\n\\n## Symptoms and Stages\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary and typically present in stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Stage (weeks 1-4)**\\n   - A characteristic rash known as erythema migrans often appears at the site of a tick bite. This rash may gradually expand and take on a \\\"bull's-eye\\\" appearance, with a clear center surrounded by a red ring. \\n   - Other early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, joint stiffness, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Stage (months 1-4)**\\n   - If left untreated, the infection can spread, leading to additional rashes, neurological issues like facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), heart problems (such as irregular heartbeat), and potential neuropathies.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Stage (after 4 months)**\\n   - This stage may involve persistent arthritis, particularly in large joints such as the knees. Patients may also experience more severe neurological complications, like cognitive difficulties, and chronic pain.\\n\\n4. **Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)**\\n   - Some individuals may continue to experience symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and cognitive difficulties even after treatment, which may not respond to additional antibiotics.\\n\\n## Causes and Transmission\\nThe primary vector for Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which transmits the *Borrelia* bacteria to humans during feeding. Ticks can become infected by feeding on small mammals like mice, voles, and deer. The risk of infection is highest during the warmer months when ticks are most active, and the disease is more commonly reported in the Northeastern, Upper Midwest, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Lyme disease typically involves a combination of a patient's reported symptoms, history of potential exposure to ticks, and serologic testing for antibodies against *Borrelia* bacteria. A two-tiered testing strategy is recommended, where an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is followed by a confirmatory western blot test for positive or equivocal results.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nLyme disease is effectively treated with antibiotics. Early-stage infections are commonly treated with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for a duration of 10-21 days. In cases of late-stage Lyme disease with severe complications, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be required. \\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventative measures are crucial in reducing the incidence of Lyme disease:\\n- Avoid tick habitats such as dense woods and tall grasses, especially during peak seasons (late spring through summer).\\n- Wear protective clothing and use insect repellents with DEET or permethrin.\\n- Perform thorough tick checks after potential exposure.\\n- Remove ticks promptly with tweezers by grasping the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible and pulling upward steadily.\\n\\n## Complications and Aftercare\\nWithout treatment, Lyme disease can lead to serious long-term health issues, including chronic arthritis, neurological complications, and cardiac involvement. Post-treatment symptoms usually improve over time, although some individuals may experience persistent symptoms requiring supportive care and rehabilitation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a serious health condition that can have lasting effects if not addressed promptly with appropriate medical intervention. Increased awareness and effective preventive practices are essential to reduce the risk of infection and promote community health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**References:**\\n1.

In cases of late-stage Lyme with serious complications, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTaking steps to prevent Lyme disease is essential:\\n- Stay away from areas where ticks thrive, such as dense woods and tall grasses, especially during peak tick season (late spring to summer).\\n- Wear protective clothing and use insect repellents containing DEET or permethrin.\\n- Conduct thorough tick checks on yourself and pets after being outdoors.\\n- If you find a tick, remove it promptly with tweezers by grasping the tick close to the skin and pulling straight out steadily.\\n\\n## Complications and Aftercare\\nIf untreated, Lyme disease can result in serious long-term health issues like chronic arthritis, neurological problems, and heart complications. Most post-treatment symptoms will improve over time, but some people might continue to experience persistent issues that require additional support and rehabilitation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a major health concern that can lead to serious complications if not treated in a timely manner.

A two-step testing approach is often used: an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a confirmatory test called a western blot for positive or uncertain results.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nLyme disease is treated effectively with antibiotics. For early-stage infections, common antibiotics include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil, typically given for 10 to 21 days. In cases of late-stage Lyme with serious complications, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTaking steps to prevent Lyme disease is essential:\\n- Stay away from areas where ticks thrive, such as dense woods and tall grasses, especially during peak tick season (late spring to summer).\\n- Wear protective clothing and use insect repellents containing DEET or permethrin.\\n- Conduct thorough tick checks on yourself and pets after being outdoors.\\n- If you find a tick, remove it promptly with tweezers by grasping the tick close to the skin and pulling straight out steadily.\\n\\n## Complications and Aftercare\\nIf untreated, Lyme disease can result in serious long-term health issues like chronic arthritis, neurological problems, and heart complications. Most post-treatment symptoms will improve over time, but some people might continue to experience persistent issues that require additional support and rehabilitation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a major health concern that can lead to serious complications if not treated in a timely manner. Raising awareness and practicing effective prevention strategies are critical to reducing the risk of infection and ensuring community health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**References:**\\n1.

The primary bacteria responsible for Lyme disease in North America is *Borrelia burgdorferi*, transmitted predominantly through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, commonly referred to as deer ticks. Lyme disease was first recognized in the 1970s after numerous cases of arthritis were reported in children living in Lyme, Connecticut.\\n\\n## Symptoms and Stages\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary and typically present in stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Stage (weeks 1-4)**\\n   - A characteristic rash known as erythema migrans often appears at the site of a tick bite. This rash may gradually expand and take on a \\\"bull's-eye\\\" appearance, with a clear center surrounded by a red ring. \\n   - Other early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, joint stiffness, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Stage (months 1-4)**\\n   - If left untreated, the infection can spread, leading to additional rashes, neurological issues like facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), heart problems (such as irregular heartbeat), and potential neuropathies.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Stage (after 4 months)**\\n   - This stage may involve persistent arthritis, particularly in large joints such as the knees. Patients may also experience more severe neurological complications, like cognitive difficulties, and chronic pain.\\n\\n4. **Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)**\\n   - Some individuals may continue to experience symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and cognitive difficulties even after treatment, which may not respond to additional antibiotics.\\n\\n## Causes and Transmission\\nThe primary vector for Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which transmits the *Borrelia* bacteria to humans during feeding. Ticks can become infected by feeding on small mammals like mice, voles, and deer. The risk of infection is highest during the warmer months when ticks are most active, and the disease is more commonly reported in the Northeastern, Upper Midwest, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Lyme disease typically involves a combination of a patient's reported symptoms, history of potential exposure to ticks, and serologic testing for antibodies against *Borrelia* bacteria. A two-tiered testing strategy is recommended, where an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is followed by a confirmatory western blot test for positive or equivocal results.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nLyme disease is effectively treated with antibiotics. Early-stage infections are commonly treated with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for a duration of 10-21 days. In cases of late-stage Lyme disease with severe complications, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be required. \\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventative measures are crucial in reducing the incidence of Lyme disease:\\n- Avoid tick habitats such as dense woods and tall grasses, especially during peak seasons (late spring through summer).\\n- Wear protective clothing and use insect repellents with DEET or permethrin.\\n- Perform thorough tick checks after potential exposure.\\n- Remove ticks promptly with tweezers by grasping the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible and pulling upward steadily.\\n\\n## Complications and Aftercare\\nWithout treatment, Lyme disease can lead to serious long-term health issues, including chronic arthritis, neurological complications, and cardiac involvement. Post-treatment symptoms usually improve over time, although some individuals may experience persistent symptoms requiring supportive care and rehabilitation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a serious health condition that can have lasting effects if not addressed promptly with appropriate medical intervention. Increased awareness and effective preventive practices are essential to reduce the risk of infection and promote community health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**References:**\\n1.

The most common bacteria causing Lyme disease in North America is *Borrelia burgdorferi*. The disease is primarily spread to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, also known as deer ticks. Lyme disease was first identified in the 1970s when several cases of arthritis were reported in children in Lyme, Connecticut.\\n\\n## Symptoms and Stages\\nLyme disease has varying symptoms that generally develop in stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Stage (weeks 1-4)**\\n   - The most recognizable sign is a rash known as erythema migrans, which often appears at the site of a tick bite. This rash can expand and form a \\\"bull's-eye\\\" pattern, with a clear center surrounded by a red ring.\\n   - Other initial symptoms may include fever, headaches, tiredness, joint stiffness, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Stage (months 1-4)**\\n   - If not treated, the infection can spread and cause additional rashes, neurological problems (like facial paralysis known as Bell's palsy), heart issues (such as irregular heartbeat), and nerve pain.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Stage (after 4 months)**\\n   - This stage might lead to persistent arthritis, especially in larger joints like the knees. Patients could experience severe neurological complications, including problems with memory and chronic pain.\\n\\n4. **Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)**\\n   - Some individuals may continue to suffer from fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and cognitive difficulties even after treatment, which may not improve with further antibiotics.\\n\\n## Causes and Transmission\\nThe main carriers of Lyme disease are blacklegged ticks (*Ixodes scapularis*), which pass the *Borrelia* bacteria to humans when they bite.

The primary bacteria responsible for Lyme disease in North America is *Borrelia burgdorferi*, transmitted predominantly through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, commonly referred to as deer ticks. Lyme disease was first recognized in the 1970s after numerous cases of arthritis were reported in children living in Lyme, Connecticut.\\n\\n## Symptoms and Stages\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary and typically present in stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Stage (weeks 1-4)**\\n   - A characteristic rash known as erythema migrans often appears at the site of a tick bite. This rash may gradually expand and take on a \\\"bull's-eye\\\" appearance, with a clear center surrounded by a red ring. \\n   - Other early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, joint stiffness, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Stage (months 1-4)**\\n   - If left untreated, the infection can spread, leading to additional rashes, neurological issues like facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), heart problems (such as irregular heartbeat), and potential neuropathies.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Stage (after 4 months)**\\n   - This stage may involve persistent arthritis, particularly in large joints such as the knees. Patients may also experience more severe neurological complications, like cognitive difficulties, and chronic pain.\\n\\n4. **Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)**\\n   - Some individuals may continue to experience symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and cognitive difficulties even after treatment, which may not respond to additional antibiotics.\\n\\n## Causes and Transmission\\nThe primary vector for Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which transmits the *Borrelia* bacteria to humans during feeding. Ticks can become infected by feeding on small mammals like mice, voles, and deer. The risk of infection is highest during the warmer months when ticks are most active, and the disease is more commonly reported in the Northeastern, Upper Midwest, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Lyme disease typically involves a combination of a patient's reported symptoms, history of potential exposure to ticks, and serologic testing for antibodies against *Borrelia* bacteria. A two-tiered testing strategy is recommended, where an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is followed by a confirmatory western blot test for positive or equivocal results.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nLyme disease is effectively treated with antibiotics. Early-stage infections are commonly treated with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for a duration of 10-21 days. In cases of late-stage Lyme disease with severe complications, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be required. \\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventative measures are crucial in reducing the incidence of Lyme disease:\\n- Avoid tick habitats such as dense woods and tall grasses, especially during peak seasons (late spring through summer).\\n- Wear protective clothing and use insect repellents with DEET or permethrin.\\n- Perform thorough tick checks after potential exposure.\\n- Remove ticks promptly with tweezers by grasping the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible and pulling upward steadily.\\n\\n## Complications and Aftercare\\nWithout treatment, Lyme disease can lead to serious long-term health issues, including chronic arthritis, neurological complications, and cardiac involvement. Post-treatment symptoms usually improve over time, although some individuals may experience persistent symptoms requiring supportive care and rehabilitation.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a serious health condition that can have lasting effects if not addressed promptly with appropriate medical intervention. Increased awareness and effective preventive practices are essential to reduce the risk of infection and promote community health.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**References:**\\n1.

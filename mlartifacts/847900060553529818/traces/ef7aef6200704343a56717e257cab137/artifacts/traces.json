Overview of Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect the nose, throat, and lungs. The flu is characterized by its sudden onset and can lead to mild to severe illness. In some cases, it can result in death, especially among high-risk groups. The flu typically circulates in seasonal epidemics, with a usual peak from October to May in North America. \\n\\nThe best method to mitigate the impacts of seasonal flu is through annual vaccination, which helps protect against the strains of the virus expected to be most prevalent in the upcoming season.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms of Influenza\\nFlu symptoms often appear suddenly and can include the following:\\n- **Fever or chills**: Many affected individuals may experience a fever, although not everyone will have one.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent cough is common.\\n- **Sore throat**: Soreness in the throat is frequently reported.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: This may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Muscle or body aches**: General discomfort and bodily pain are common.\\n- **Headaches**: Headaches can be a significant symptom.\\n- **Fatigue (tiredness)**: Many individuals report extreme fatigue with the flu.\\n- **Sweating and chills**: Sweating, coupled with chills, is often seen.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms such as ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may occur more frequently than in adults.\\n\\n## 3. How Influenza Spreads\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also be contracted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Notably, individuals can begin spreading the virus to others approximately one day before symptoms appear and can continue to do so for 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors for Complications\\nCertain populations are at greater risk for severe flu complications:\\n- **Young children**, especially those under 2 years old.\\n- **Elderly adults**, particularly those over 65 years old.\\n- Individuals with **weakened immune systems**.\\n- **Pregnant women**.\\n- People with **chronic medical conditions** such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\n## 5. Complications from the Flu\\nWhile many healthy individuals will recover within a week, the flu can pose significant complications for high-risk groups. Possible complications include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: A severe respiratory infection that can be life-threatening.\\n- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: A serious condition affecting breathing.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health issues**: Conditions such as asthma or heart disease can worsen following a flu infection.\\n- **Secondary bacterial infections**: To include sinus and ear infections.\\n- **Sepsis or toxic shock syndrome**: These serious conditions can also arise from influenza infection.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention of Influenza\\nVaccination is the cornerstone of flu prevention. The CDC recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive an annual flu shot, which significantly reduces the risk of illness, severe complications, and hospitalization.\\n\\n### Additional preventive measures include:\\n- **Hand washing**: Regular washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.\\n- **Avoiding face touching**: Keeping hands away from the eyes, nose, and mouth.\\n- **Covering coughs and sneezes**: Using tissues or elbows to minimize the spread of droplets.\\n- **Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces**: This reduces the chance of contamination.\\n- **Staying home when unwell**: This is crucial to prevent spreading the virus to others.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment of Influenza\\nMost flu cases can be treated at home with rest and fluids; however, antiviral medications can be effective if taken within the first two days of symptom onset. These medications can shorten the duration of illness and help prevent complications.\\n\\n**Emergency symptoms** that necessitate immediate medical attention include:\\n- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\\n- Chest pain or pressure.\\n- Confusion or dizziness.\\n- Severe dehydration or persistent worsening symptoms.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines and being aware of influenza's symptoms and transmission, individuals can play an essential role in reducing the incidence and severity of the flu during outbreak seasons.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"tasks_output\": [{\"description\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Influenza (Flu) Make sure you find any relevant information of renowned sources.\\n\", \"name\": \"research_task\", \"expected_output\": \"A set of relevant information about Influenza (Flu)\\n\", \"summary\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Influenza (Flu) Make sure you...\", \"raw\": \"Influenza (Flu) Overview:\\nInfluenza, commonly referred to as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs.

This reaction leads to symptoms that resemble a cold, such as sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus discomfort. Common triggers for hay fever include pollen from trees, grass, pet fur, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nPeople with hay fever may experience several symptoms, which can significantly disrupt daily life. These include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A rapid expulsion of air from the nose that occurs due to nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny Nose**: Often produces clear mucus.\\n- **Nasal Congestion**: Difficulty breathing through the nose due to swelling and inflammation.\\n- **Itchy Eyes/Nose/Throat**: Leads to discomfort and redness, often associated with swelling.\\n- **Watery Eyes**: Increased tearing as a response to allergens.\\n- **Postnasal Drip**: Mucus accumulation in the throat, leading to coughing, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Often results from poor sleep quality when nasal passages are congested.\\n\\nThe severity and timing of these symptoms can differ based on individual reactions and the presence of specific allergens throughout different seasons.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by several allergens which can be categorized into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: \\n  - **Tree Pollen**: Common in spring.\\n  - **Grass Pollen**: Peaks in summer.\\n  - **Ragweed Pollen**: Found in late summer and fall.\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: \\n  - **Dust Mites**: Tiny creatures that thrive in household dust.\\n  - **Pet Dander**: Flecks of skin shed by furry pets.\\n  - **Cockroach Droppings**: Waste matter from cockroaches.\\n  - **Mold Spores**: Produced by mold, especially in damp conditions.\\n- **Irritants**: Such as cigarette smoke, strong smells (like perfume), cleaning products, and pollution may cause or exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and avoiding these triggers is essential for effective management of hay fever.\\n\\n## Causes\\nHay fever happens when the immune system mistakenly perceives normally harmless substances as dangerous. This leads to the production of specific antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). When these antibodies meet the allergens, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which is responsible for most of the allergic symptoms.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally requires:\\n- A thorough discussion of the patient's medical history and current symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests (such as skin prick tests or blood tests) to pinpoint specific allergens.\\n- Assessments for any related complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nAccurate diagnosis is crucial to determining the most effective treatment plan.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe first step for managing hay fever is to minimize contact with known allergens:\\n- **Keep Windows Closed**: During high pollen seasons.\\n- **Use Air Conditioning**: Helps filter out allergens.\\n- **Wear Sunglasses**: Outdoors to shield eyes from pollen.\\n- **Limit Indoor Exposure**: Keep pets out of sleeping areas and frequently clean to reduce allergen accumulation.\\n\\n### 2. Medications\\nDifferent types of medications can be used to relieve symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Alleviate sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Available in pills and nasal spray forms.\\n- **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n- **Decongestants**: Reduce stuffiness but should be taken only short-term due to potential side effects.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block allergic reaction-triggering substances in the body.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Involves gradually introducing allergens to build tolerance, offered through allergy shots or oral tablets.\\n\\n### 3. Non-Medication Strategies\\nAdditional strategies to help manage symptoms include:\\n- **Nasal Saline Rinses**: Clear nasal passages of allergens.\\n- **HEPA Filters**: Use in home air systems to trap particles.\\n- **Regular Cleaning**: Wash bedding and clothes in hot water to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n## Complications\\nIf left untreated, hay fever can lead to several issues:\\n- **Poor Sleep Quality**: Resulting in daytime fatigue and decreased productivity.\\n- **Increased Risk of Asthma**: May develop alongside other allergic conditions.\\n- **Sinusitis or Ear Infections**: More common in children with untreated hay fever.\\n\\n## When to See a Doctor\\nIt is recommended to see a healthcare professional when:\\n- Symptoms greatly interfere with daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about potential complications like asthma.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever is a widespread yet manageable condition with various treatment options available. A personalized management plan, often developed with the help of an allergist, can significantly improve symptoms and overall well-being.

This reaction leads to symptoms that resemble a cold, such as sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus discomfort. Common triggers for hay fever include pollen from trees, grass, pet fur, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nPeople with hay fever may experience several symptoms, which can significantly disrupt daily life. These include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A rapid expulsion of air from the nose that occurs due to nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny Nose**: Often produces clear mucus.\\n- **Nasal Congestion**: Difficulty breathing through the nose due to swelling and inflammation.\\n- **Itchy Eyes/Nose/Throat**: Leads to discomfort and redness, often associated with swelling.\\n- **Watery Eyes**: Increased tearing as a response to allergens.\\n- **Postnasal Drip**: Mucus accumulation in the throat, leading to coughing, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Often results from poor sleep quality when nasal passages are congested.\\n\\nThe severity and timing of these symptoms can differ based on individual reactions and the presence of specific allergens throughout different seasons.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by several allergens which can be categorized into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: \\n  - **Tree Pollen**: Common in spring.\\n  - **Grass Pollen**: Peaks in summer.\\n  - **Ragweed Pollen**: Found in late summer and fall.\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: \\n  - **Dust Mites**: Tiny creatures that thrive in household dust.\\n  - **Pet Dander**: Flecks of skin shed by furry pets.\\n  - **Cockroach Droppings**: Waste matter from cockroaches.\\n  - **Mold Spores**: Produced by mold, especially in damp conditions.\\n- **Irritants**: Such as cigarette smoke, strong smells (like perfume), cleaning products, and pollution may cause or exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and avoiding these triggers is essential for effective management of hay fever.\\n\\n## Causes\\nHay fever happens when the immune system mistakenly perceives normally harmless substances as dangerous. This leads to the production of specific antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). When these antibodies meet the allergens, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which is responsible for most of the allergic symptoms.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally requires:\\n- A thorough discussion of the patient's medical history and current symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests (such as skin prick tests or blood tests) to pinpoint specific allergens.\\n- Assessments for any related complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nAccurate diagnosis is crucial to determining the most effective treatment plan.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe first step for managing hay fever is to minimize contact with known allergens:\\n- **Keep Windows Closed**: During high pollen seasons.\\n- **Use Air Conditioning**: Helps filter out allergens.\\n- **Wear Sunglasses**: Outdoors to shield eyes from pollen.\\n- **Limit Indoor Exposure**: Keep pets out of sleeping areas and frequently clean to reduce allergen accumulation.\\n\\n### 2. Medications\\nDifferent types of medications can be used to relieve symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Alleviate sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Available in pills and nasal spray forms.\\n- **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n- **Decongestants**: Reduce stuffiness but should be taken only short-term due to potential side effects.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block allergic reaction-triggering substances in the body.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Involves gradually introducing allergens to build tolerance, offered through allergy shots or oral tablets.\\n\\n### 3. Non-Medication Strategies\\nAdditional strategies to help manage symptoms include:\\n- **Nasal Saline Rinses**: Clear nasal passages of allergens.\\n- **HEPA Filters**: Use in home air systems to trap particles.\\n- **Regular Cleaning**: Wash bedding and clothes in hot water to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n## Complications\\nIf left untreated, hay fever can lead to several issues:\\n- **Poor Sleep Quality**: Resulting in daytime fatigue and decreased productivity.\\n- **Increased Risk of Asthma**: May develop alongside other allergic conditions.\\n- **Sinusitis or Ear Infections**: More common in children with untreated hay fever.\\n\\n## When to See a Doctor\\nIt is recommended to see a healthcare professional when:\\n- Symptoms greatly interfere with daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about potential complications like asthma.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever is a widespread yet manageable condition with various treatment options available. A personalized management plan, often developed with the help of an allergist, can significantly improve symptoms and overall well-being.

Tests may be conducted to rule out COVID-19, the flu, or other conditions.\\n\\n6. **Treatment**:\\n   - There is no cure for a cold, but symptoms can be managed using over-the-counter medications (e.g., pain relievers, decongestants, antihistamines).\\n   - Home remedies, staying hydrated, and rest are also recommended.\\n\\n7. **Prevention**:\\n   - Hand washing is the most effective preventive measure. Avoiding close contact with sick individuals and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces are crucial as well.\\n   - No vaccine is available for the common cold. Healthy lifestyle choices such as adequate sleep and nutrition can help support the immune system.\\n\\n8. **Complications**:\\n   - Potential complications include middle ear infections, asthma exacerbation, and sinusitis. \\n\\n9. **Recommendations**:\\n   - Consult a healthcare provider if symptoms worsen, a high fever develops, or breathing difficulties occur, especially in infants and children who exhibit more severe symptoms.\\n\\nSources:\\n- Mayo Clinic: \\\"Common cold - Symptoms and causes\\\"\\n- Cleveland Clinic: \\\"Common Cold\\\"\\n\\n```\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_1", "context": {"span_id": "0x248ee99d5bdc9b84", "trace_id": "0x6e6648ef59d6075daca44ae956fbc770"}, "parent_id": "0x683aa9670a75b2a0", "start_time": 1742219278591420313, "end_time": 1742219280537892380, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"ef7aef6200704343a56717e257cab137\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Common Cold Senior Data Researcher\\n.

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.\\nA cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by:\\nDroplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.\\nHand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.\\nSharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.\\nTouching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.\\nRisk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:\\nAge. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\\nCover your cough. Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.\\nDon't share. Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.\\nStay away from people with colds. Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.\\nReview your child care center's policies. Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.\\nTake care of yourself. Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nMay 24, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nAAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Colds spread easily, especially within homes, classrooms and workplaces. More than 200 different viruses can cause colds.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.\\nA cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by:\\nDroplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.\\nHand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.\\nSharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.\\nTouching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.\\nRisk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:\\nAge. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\\nCover your cough. Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.\\nDon't share. Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.\\nStay away from people with colds. Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.\\nReview your child care center's policies. Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.\\nTake care of yourself. Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nMay 24, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nAAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Colds spread easily, especially within homes, classrooms and workplaces. More than 200 different viruses can cause colds. There’s no cure for a common cold, but it usually goes away within a week to 10 days. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

It is predominantly caused by over 200 different types of viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common culprits. These infections are typically mild in nature but are a leading cause of absence from work and school. On average, adults experience 2 to 3 colds annually, while young children can contract colds four times or more each year due to their developing immune systems. The illness tends to spread significantly during colder months, although it can occur at any time of the year.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nInitial symptoms of a cold usually appear within 1 to 3 days after exposure and may include:\\n- Sore or scratchy throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Cough\\n- Sneezing\\n\\nAs the infection progresses (4 to 7 days), symptoms can worsen, presenting:\\n- Body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Fatigue\\n- Low-grade fever\\n\\nAfter about a week, symptoms generally start to improve (8 to 10 days), though a lingering cough may persist for several weeks following initial recovery.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nThe common cold is infectious and is mainly transmitted through viral droplets when an infected individual coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also spread through hand-to-hand contact or by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus followed by hand-to-face contact. Enclosed and crowded settings, such as classrooms and offices, facilitate the spread of the virus significantly.\\n\\n### Risk Factors\\nSome individuals are at a higher risk of contracting the common cold, including:\\n- **Infants and young children**: Their immune systems are still developing, making them more susceptible.\\n- **Weakened immune systems**: People with chronic illnesses or medical conditions that compromise immunity are at greater risk.\\n- **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking, lack of sleep, and exposure to crowds—especially during cold and flu season—increase vulnerability to colds.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nHealthcare providers typically diagnose the common cold through a physical examination while taking into account the patient's reported symptoms. There are no specific tests for a cold, but diagnostic tests may be performed to exclude other illnesses, such as COVID-19 or the flu, particularly in cases with unusual or severe symptoms.\\n\\n### Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no cure for the common cold; however, symptom management is possible with over-the-counter medications, including:\\n- Pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen)\\n- Decongestants\\n- Antihistamines\\n\\nHome remedies such as increased fluid intake, herbal teas, and humidifiers can also provide relief. Rest is critical during the healing process.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nThe best preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of contracting a cold include:\\n- **Hand hygiene**: Regular and thorough hand washing with soap and water is the most effective way to prevent the virus's spread.\\n- **Avoiding close contact**: Keeping a distance from individuals who are sick can limit exposure.\\n- **Disinfection**: Frequently touched surfaces should be sanitized regularly.\\nThough there is currently no vaccine for the common cold, a healthy lifestyle with adequate rest and nutrition can bolster the immune system's defenses.\\n\\n### Complications\\nWhile most colds are self-limiting and result in full recovery, certain complications can occur, notably:\\n- Middle ear infections\\n- Asthma exacerbation\\n- Sinusitis\\n\\n### Recommendations\\nIt is advisable to consult a healthcare provider if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or do not improve after several days.\\n- High fever develops.\\n- Breathing difficulties arise.\\nThis is especially vital for infants, children, or individuals with preexisting health conditions exhibiting severe symptoms.\\n\\nSources: \\n- Mayo Clinic: \\\"Common cold - Symptoms and causes\\\"\\n- Cleveland Clinic: \\\"Common Cold\\\"\\n- CDC: \\\"About Common Cold\\\"\\n- Medical News Today: \\\"Common colds: Symptoms, causes, complications, and treatment\\\"\\n- AAFP: \\\"Treatment of the Common Cold\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nThought: I now know the final answer\\nFinal Answer: The detailed report on the common cold has been successfully compiled, providing a comprehensive overview of various aspects, including symptoms, transmission, treatment, and preventative measures.\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"I have gathered additional information from credible sources regarding the common cold which I can use to expand the report.\\n\\n```\\n## Common Cold Report\\n\\n### General Overview\\nThe common cold is a contagious upper respiratory tract infection primarily affecting the nose and throat.

It is predominantly caused by over 200 different types of viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common culprits. These infections are typically mild in nature but are a leading cause of absence from work and school. On average, adults experience 2 to 3 colds annually, while young children can contract colds four times or more each year due to their developing immune systems. The illness tends to spread significantly during colder months, although it can occur at any time of the year.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nInitial symptoms of a cold usually appear within 1 to 3 days after exposure and may include:\\n- Sore or scratchy throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Cough\\n- Sneezing\\n\\nAs the infection progresses (4 to 7 days), symptoms can worsen, presenting:\\n- Body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Fatigue\\n- Low-grade fever\\n\\nAfter about a week, symptoms generally start to improve (8 to 10 days), though a lingering cough may persist for several weeks following initial recovery.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nThe common cold is infectious and is mainly transmitted through viral droplets when an infected individual coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also spread through hand-to-hand contact or by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus followed by hand-to-face contact. Enclosed and crowded settings, such as classrooms and offices, facilitate the spread of the virus significantly.\\n\\n### Risk Factors\\nSome individuals are at a higher risk of contracting the common cold, including:\\n- **Infants and young children**: Their immune systems are still developing, making them more susceptible.\\n- **Weakened immune systems**: People with chronic illnesses or medical conditions that compromise immunity are at greater risk.\\n- **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking, lack of sleep, and exposure to crowds—especially during cold and flu season—increase vulnerability to colds.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nHealthcare providers typically diagnose the common cold through a physical examination while taking into account the patient's reported symptoms. There are no specific tests for a cold, but diagnostic tests may be performed to exclude other illnesses, such as COVID-19 or the flu, particularly in cases with unusual or severe symptoms.\\n\\n### Treatment\\nCurrently, there is no cure for the common cold; however, symptom management is possible with over-the-counter medications, including:\\n- Pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen)\\n- Decongestants\\n- Antihistamines\\n\\nHome remedies such as increased fluid intake, herbal teas, and humidifiers can also provide relief.

Tests may be conducted to rule out COVID-19, the flu, or other conditions.\\n\\n6. **Treatment**:\\n   - There is no cure for a cold, but symptoms can be managed using over-the-counter medications (e.g., pain relievers, decongestants, antihistamines).\\n   - Home remedies, staying hydrated, and rest are also recommended.\\n\\n7. **Prevention**:\\n   - Hand washing is the most effective preventive measure. Avoiding close contact with sick individuals and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces are crucial as well.\\n   - No vaccine is available for the common cold. Healthy lifestyle choices such as adequate sleep and nutrition can help support the immune system.\\n\\n8. **Complications**:\\n   - Potential complications include middle ear infections, asthma exacerbation, and sinusitis. \\n\\n9. **Recommendations**:\\n   - Consult a healthcare provider if symptoms worsen, a high fever develops, or breathing difficulties occur, especially in infants and children who exhibit more severe symptoms.\\n\\nSources:\\n- Mayo Clinic: \\\"Common cold - Symptoms and causes\\\"\\n- Cleveland Clinic: \\\"Common Cold\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\n----------\\n\\nThe detailed report on the common cold has been successfully compiled, providing a comprehensive overview of various aspects, including symptoms, transmission, treatment, and preventative measures.\\n\\nBegin!

Overview of Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect the nose, throat, and lungs. The flu is characterized by its sudden onset and can lead to mild to severe illness. In some cases, it can result in death, especially among high-risk groups. The flu typically circulates in seasonal epidemics, with a usual peak from October to May in North America. \\n\\nThe best method to mitigate the impacts of seasonal flu is through annual vaccination, which helps protect against the strains of the virus expected to be most prevalent in the upcoming season.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms of Influenza\\nFlu symptoms often appear suddenly and can include the following:\\n- **Fever or chills**: Many affected individuals may experience a fever, although not everyone will have one.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent cough is common.\\n- **Sore throat**: Soreness in the throat is frequently reported.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: This may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Muscle or body aches**: General discomfort and bodily pain are common.\\n- **Headaches**: Headaches can be a significant symptom.\\n- **Fatigue (tiredness)**: Many individuals report extreme fatigue with the flu.\\n- **Sweating and chills**: Sweating, coupled with chills, is often seen.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms such as ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may occur more frequently than in adults.\\n\\n## 3. How Influenza Spreads\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.

Staying adequately hydrated and resting are also essential components of care.\\n\\nProblematic symptoms that warrant emergency care include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion, or symptoms that improve but then return.\\n\\nSources:\\n- CDC: [Influenza (Flu)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- Mayo Clinic: [Influenza (Flu) Symptoms and Causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n```\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_8", "context": {"span_id": "0x111bd8800a8a48f9", "trace_id": "0x6e6648ef59d6075daca44ae956fbc770"}, "parent_id": "0xa43bebff53f081d6", "start_time": 1742219322227749083, "end_time": 1742219323586756637, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"ef7aef6200704343a56717e257cab137\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Influenza (Flu) Senior Data Researcher\\n.

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu can lead to mild to severe illness and, in some cases, can result in death.\\n\\nSymptoms of Influenza:\\nFlu symptoms typically begin abruptly and can include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Muscle or body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Feeling very tired\\n- Sweating and chills\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms like ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may also occur.\\n\\nHow Influenza Spreads:\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces that have been contaminated and then touching their mouth, eyes, or nose. One can start spreading the virus to others from approximately one day before symptoms appear and up to 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\nRisk Factors:\\nCertain groups are at a higher risk for complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially under 2 years)\\n- Elderly adults (over 65 years)\\n- Individuals with weakened immune systems\\n- Pregnant women\\n- Those with chronic illnesses like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\nComplications from the Flu:\\nAlthough most healthy individuals recover from the flu within a week, it can pose significant complications for high-risk groups. Some complications can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Acute respiratory distress syndrome\\n- Worsening of chronic health problems\\n- Role of the flu in various serious medical conditions like sepsis and toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\nPrevention:\\nVaccination is the primary tool for preventing influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu shot for everyone aged 6 months and older. The flu vaccine can reduce the risk of getting the flu, the chance of severe illness, and even the risk of hospitalization.\\n\\nControl Measures:\\nOther preventive measures include:\\n- Regular hand washing\\n- Avoiding touching one's face\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes\\n- Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects \\n- Staying home when feeling unwell to prevent the spread of infection.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nWhile most cases are manageable at home, antiviral medications can be effective if administered within the first two days of symptoms appearing. Staying adequately hydrated and resting are also essential components of care.\\n\\nProblematic symptoms that warrant emergency care include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion, or symptoms that improve but then return.\\n\\nSources:\\n- CDC: [Influenza (Flu)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- Mayo Clinic: [Influenza (Flu) Symptoms and Causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n```\\n\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"```\\nThought: I have gathered comprehensive information about Influenza (Flu) from reliable sources.

Overview of Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect the nose, throat, and lungs. The flu is characterized by its abrupt onset and can lead to mild to severe illness. In some cases, it can result in death, especially among high-risk groups. The flu typically circulates in seasonal epidemics, with a usual peak from October to May in North America. \\n\\nThe best method to mitigate the impacts of seasonal flu is through annual vaccination, which helps protect against the strains of the virus expected to be most prevalent in the upcoming season.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms of Influenza\\nFlu symptoms often appear suddenly and can include the following:\\n- **Fever or chills**: Many affected individuals may experience fever, although not everyone with the flu will have a fever.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent cough is common.\\n- **Sore throat**: Soreness in the throat is frequently reported.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: This may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Muscle or body aches**: General discomfort and bodily pain are common.\\n- **Headaches**: Headaches can be a significant symptom.\\n- **Fatigue (tiredness)**: Many individuals report extreme fatigue with the flu.\\n- **Sweating and chills**: Sweating, coupled with chills, is also often seen.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms such as ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may occur more frequently than in adults.\\n\\n## 3. How Influenza Spreads\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also be contracted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Notably, individuals can begin spreading the virus to others approximately one day before symptoms appear and can continue to do so for 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors for Complications\\nCertain populations are at greater risk for severe flu complications:\\n- **Young children**, especially those under 2 years old.\\n- **Elderly adults**, particularly those over 65 years old.\\n- Individuals with **weakened immune systems**.\\n- **Pregnant women**.\\n- People with **chronic medical conditions** such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\n## 5. Complications from the Flu\\nWhile many healthy individuals will recover within a week, flu can cause significant complications for high-risk groups. Possible complications include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: A severe respiratory infection that can be life-threatening.\\n- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: A serious condition affecting breathing.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health issues**: Conditions such as asthma or heart disease can deteriorate following a flu infection.\\n- **Secondary bacterial infections**: Such as sinus infections or ear infections.\\n- **Sepsis or toxic shock syndrome**: These serious conditions can also arise from influenza infection.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention of Influenza\\nVaccination is the cornerstone of flu prevention. The CDC recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive an annual flu shot, which significantly reduces the risk of illness, severe complications, and hospitalization.\\n\\n### Additional preventive measures include:\\n- **Hand washing**: Regular washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.\\n- **Avoiding face touching**: Keeping hands away from the eyes, nose, and mouth.\\n- **Covering coughs and sneezes**: Using tissues or elbows to minimize the spread of droplets.\\n- **Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces**: This reduces the chance of contamination.\\n- **Staying home when unwell**: This is crucial to prevent spreading the virus to others.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment of Influenza\\nMost flu cases can be treated at home with rest and fluids; however, antiviral medications can be effective if taken within the first two days of symptom onset. These medications can shorten the duration of illness and help prevent complications.\\n\\n**Emergency symptoms** that necessitate immediate medical attention include:\\n- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\\n- Chest pain or pressure.\\n- Confusion or dizziness.\\n- Severe dehydration or persistent symptoms that worsen.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines and being aware of influenza's symptoms and transmission, individuals can play an important role in reducing the incidence and severity of the flu during outbreak seasons.\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Influenza (Flu) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_5", "context": {"span_id": "0x1a6282a2e12b9e3e", "trace_id": "0x6e6648ef59d6075daca44ae956fbc770"}, "parent_id": "0xc26e737c55d9a994", "start_time": 1742219332873999018, "end_time": 1742219362839588737, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"ef7aef6200704343a56717e257cab137\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"Influenza (Flu) Overview:\\nInfluenza, commonly referred to as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs.

Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces that have been contaminated and then touching their mouth, eyes, or nose. One can start spreading the virus to others from approximately one day before symptoms appear and up to 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\nRisk Factors:\\nCertain groups are at a higher risk for complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially under 2 years)\\n- Elderly adults (over 65 years)\\n- Individuals with weakened immune systems\\n- Pregnant women\\n- Those with chronic illnesses like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\nComplications from the Flu:\\nAlthough most healthy individuals recover from the flu within a week, it can pose significant complications for high-risk groups. Some complications can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Acute respiratory distress syndrome\\n- Worsening of chronic health problems\\n- Role of the flu in various serious medical conditions like sepsis and toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\nPrevention:\\nVaccination is the primary tool for preventing influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu shot for everyone aged 6 months and older. The flu vaccine can reduce the risk of getting the flu, the chance of severe illness, and even the risk of hospitalization.\\n\\nControl Measures:\\nOther preventive measures include:\\n- Regular hand washing\\n- Avoiding touching one's face\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes\\n- Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects \\n- Staying home when feeling unwell to prevent the spread of infection.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nWhile most cases are manageable at home, antiviral medications can be effective if administered within the first two days of symptoms appearing. Staying adequately hydrated and resting are also essential components of care.\\n\\nProblematic symptoms that warrant emergency care include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion, or symptoms that improve but then return.\\n\\nSources:\\n- CDC: [Influenza (Flu)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- Mayo Clinic: [Influenza (Flu) Symptoms and Causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

The flu can lead to mild to severe illness and, in some cases, can result in death.\\n\\nSymptoms of Influenza:\\nFlu symptoms typically begin abruptly and can include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Muscle or body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Feeling very tired\\n- Sweating and chills\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms like ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may also occur.\\n\\nHow Influenza Spreads:\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces that have been contaminated and then touching their mouth, eyes, or nose. One can start spreading the virus to others from approximately one day before symptoms appear and up to 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\nRisk Factors:\\nCertain groups are at a higher risk for complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially under 2 years)\\n- Elderly adults (over 65 years)\\n- Individuals with weakened immune systems\\n- Pregnant women\\n- Those with chronic illnesses like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\nComplications from the Flu:\\nAlthough most healthy individuals recover from the flu within a week, it can pose significant complications for high-risk groups. Some complications can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Acute respiratory distress syndrome\\n- Worsening of chronic health problems\\n- Role of the flu in various serious medical conditions like sepsis and toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\nPrevention:\\nVaccination is the primary tool for preventing influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu shot for everyone aged 6 months and older. The flu vaccine can reduce the risk of getting the flu, the chance of severe illness, and even the risk of hospitalization.\\n\\nControl Measures:\\nOther preventive measures include:\\n- Regular hand washing\\n- Avoiding touching one's face\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes\\n- Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects \\n- Staying home when feeling unwell to prevent the spread of infection.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nWhile most cases are manageable at home, antiviral medications can be effective if administered within the first two days of symptoms appearing. Staying adequately hydrated and resting are also essential components of care.\\n\\nProblematic symptoms that warrant emergency care include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion, or symptoms that improve but then return.\\n\\nSources:\\n- CDC: [Influenza (Flu)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- Mayo Clinic: [Influenza (Flu) Symptoms and Causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year.\\nSymptoms\\nFlu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these signs and symptoms:\\nfever* or feeling feverish/chills\\ncough\\nsore throat\\nrunny or stuffy nose\\nmuscle or body aches\\nheadaches\\nfatigue (tiredness)\\nsome people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.\\n*It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.\\nNot everyone with flu has symptoms\\nSome people with influenza virus infections do not develop any symptoms at all. A household study conducted during the 2017-2023 flu seasons found that 8 percent of people who tested positive for flu did not have symptoms.\\nKeep Reading:\\nSimilarities and Differences between Flu and COVID-19\\nHow long it takes for signs to show\\nPeriod of Contagiousness\\nYou may be able to spread flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as when you are sick with symptoms.\\nPeople with flu are most contagious during the first three days of their illness.\\nSome otherwise healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning one day before symptoms develop and up to five to seven days after becoming sick.\\nSome people, including young children and people with weakened immune systems, may be contagious for longer periods of time.\\nOnset of Symptoms\\nThe time from when a person is exposed and infected with influenza virus to when symptoms begin is about two days but can range from about one to four days.\\nPeople at risk\\nAnyone can get flu (including healthy people), and serious problems related to flu can happen at any age, but some people are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick. This includes people 65 years and older, people of any age with certain chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease),  people with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m 2  or higher , those who are pregnant, and children younger than five years.\\nHow it spreads\\nMost experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.\\nPrevention\\nThe first and most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccine each year. Flu vaccine has been shown to reduce flu-related illnesses and the risk of serious flu complications that can result in hospitalization or even death. CDC also recommends everyday preventive actions (like staying away from people who are sick (distancing) , covering coughs and sneezes, frequent handwashing , and taking steps for cleaner air ) to help slow the spread of germs that cause respiratory (nose, throat, and lungs) illnesses like flu. More information is available about core and additional prevention strategies .\\nQuick facts\\nU.S annual flu infection rates\\nA 2018 CDC study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases looked at the percentage of the U.S. population who got sick with flu using two different methods and compared the findings. Both methods had similar findings, which suggested that on average, about 8 percent of the U.S. population gets sick from flu each season, with a range of between 3 percent and 11 percent, depending on the season.\\nGroups most likely to get sick from flu\\nThe same CID study found that children are most likely to get sick from flu and that people 65 and older are least likely to get sick from flu. Median incidence values (or attack rate) by age group were 9.3% for children 0-17 years, 8.8% for adults 18-64 years, and 3.9% for adults 65 years and older. This means that children younger than 18 are more than twice as likely to develop a symptomatic influenza virus infection than adults 65 and older.\\nEstimating seasonal flu incidence\\nInfluenza virus infection is very common, and the number of people infected each season can only be estimated because not everyone will seek medical care or get tested for flu. Statistical estimations are based on  CDC-measured flu hospitalization rates  that are adjusted to estimate the total number of influenza virus infections in the United States for a given flu season.\\nThe estimates for the number of influenza virus infections are then divided by the census population to estimate how common influenza virus infections are in the population (called seasonal incidence or attack rate).\\nImpact of flu season severity on incidence of flu\\nThe proportion of people who get sick with flu varies.  A paper published in CID  found that between 3 percent and 11 percent of the U.S. population gets infected and develops flu symptoms each year. The 3 percent estimate is from the 2011-2012 season, which was an H1N1-predominant season classified as being of low severity. The estimated incidence of flu illness during two seasons was around 11 percent; 2012-2013 was an H3N2-predominant season classified as being of moderate severity, while 2014-2015 was an H3N2 predominant season classified as being of high severity.\\nTable 1.

The flu can lead to mild to severe illness and, in some cases, can result in death.\\n\\nSymptoms of Influenza:\\nFlu symptoms typically begin abruptly and can include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Muscle or body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Feeling very tired\\n- Sweating and chills\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms like ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may also occur.\\n\\nHow Influenza Spreads:\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces that have been contaminated and then touching their mouth, eyes, or nose. One can start spreading the virus to others from approximately one day before symptoms appear and up to 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\nRisk Factors:\\nCertain groups are at a higher risk for complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially under 2 years)\\n- Elderly adults (over 65 years)\\n- Individuals with weakened immune systems\\n- Pregnant women\\n- Those with chronic illnesses like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\nComplications from the Flu:\\nAlthough most healthy individuals recover from the flu within a week, it can pose significant complications for high-risk groups. Some complications can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Acute respiratory distress syndrome\\n- Worsening of chronic health problems\\n- Role of the flu in various serious medical conditions like sepsis and toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\nPrevention:\\nVaccination is the primary tool for preventing influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu shot for everyone aged 6 months and older. The flu vaccine can reduce the risk of getting the flu, the chance of severe illness, and even the risk of hospitalization.\\n\\nControl Measures:\\nOther preventive measures include:\\n- Regular hand washing\\n- Avoiding touching one's face\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes\\n- Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects \\n- Staying home when feeling unwell to prevent the spread of infection.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nWhile most cases are manageable at home, antiviral medications can be effective if administered within the first two days of symptoms appearing. Staying adequately hydrated and resting are also essential components of care.\\n\\nProblematic symptoms that warrant emergency care include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion, or symptoms that improve but then return.\\n\\nSources:\\n- CDC: [Influenza (Flu)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- Mayo Clinic: [Influenza (Flu) Symptoms and Causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year.\\nSymptoms\\nFlu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these signs and symptoms:\\nfever* or feeling feverish/chills\\ncough\\nsore throat\\nrunny or stuffy nose\\nmuscle or body aches\\nheadaches\\nfatigue (tiredness)\\nsome people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.\\n*It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.\\nNot everyone with flu has symptoms\\nSome people with influenza virus infections do not develop any symptoms at all. A household study conducted during the 2017-2023 flu seasons found that 8 percent of people who tested positive for flu did not have symptoms.\\nKeep Reading:\\nSimilarities and Differences between Flu and COVID-19\\nHow long it takes for signs to show\\nPeriod of Contagiousness\\nYou may be able to spread flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as when you are sick with symptoms.\\nPeople with flu are most contagious during the first three days of their illness.\\nSome otherwise healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning one day before symptoms develop and up to five to seven days after becoming sick.\\nSome people, including young children and people with weakened immune systems, may be contagious for longer periods of time.\\nOnset of Symptoms\\nThe time from when a person is exposed and infected with influenza virus to when symptoms begin is about two days but can range from about one to four days.\\nPeople at risk\\nAnyone can get flu (including healthy people), and serious problems related to flu can happen at any age, but some people are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick. This includes people 65 years and older, people of any age with certain chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease),  people with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m 2  or higher , those who are pregnant, and children younger than five years.\\nHow it spreads\\nMost experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.\\nPrevention\\nThe first and most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccine each year. Flu vaccine has been shown to reduce flu-related illnesses and the risk of serious flu complications that can result in hospitalization or even death. CDC also recommends everyday preventive actions (like staying away from people who are sick (distancing) , covering coughs and sneezes, frequent handwashing , and taking steps for cleaner air ) to help slow the spread of germs that cause respiratory (nose, throat, and lungs) illnesses like flu. More information is available about core and additional prevention strategies .\\nQuick facts\\nU.S annual flu infection rates\\nA 2018 CDC study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases looked at the percentage of the U.S. population who got sick with flu using two different methods and compared the findings. Both methods had similar findings, which suggested that on average, about 8 percent of the U.S. population gets sick from flu each season, with a range of between 3 percent and 11 percent, depending on the season.\\nGroups most likely to get sick from flu\\nThe same CID study found that children are most likely to get sick from flu and that people 65 and older are least likely to get sick from flu. Median incidence values (or attack rate) by age group were 9.3% for children 0-17 years, 8.8% for adults 18-64 years, and 3.9% for adults 65 years and older. This means that children younger than 18 are more than twice as likely to develop a symptomatic influenza virus infection than adults 65 and older.\\nEstimating seasonal flu incidence\\nInfluenza virus infection is very common, and the number of people infected each season can only be estimated because not everyone will seek medical care or get tested for flu. Statistical estimations are based on  CDC-measured flu hospitalization rates  that are adjusted to estimate the total number of influenza virus infections in the United States for a given flu season.\\nThe estimates for the number of influenza virus infections are then divided by the census population to estimate how common influenza virus infections are in the population (called seasonal incidence or attack rate).\\nImpact of flu season severity on incidence of flu\\nThe proportion of people who get sick with flu varies.  A paper published in CID  found that between 3 percent and 11 percent of the U.S. population gets infected and develops flu symptoms each year. The 3 percent estimate is from the 2011-2012 season, which was an H1N1-predominant season classified as being of low severity. The estimated incidence of flu illness during two seasons was around 11 percent; 2012-2013 was an H3N2-predominant season classified as being of moderate severity, while 2014-2015 was an H3N2 predominant season classified as being of high severity.\\nTable 1.

The flu can lead to mild to severe illness and, in some cases, can result in death.\\n\\nSymptoms of Influenza:\\nFlu symptoms typically begin abruptly and can include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Muscle or body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Feeling very tired\\n- Sweating and chills\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms like ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may also occur.\\n\\nHow Influenza Spreads:\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces that have been contaminated and then touching their mouth, eyes, or nose. One can start spreading the virus to others from approximately one day before symptoms appear and up to 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\nRisk Factors:\\nCertain groups are at a higher risk for complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially under 2 years)\\n- Elderly adults (over 65 years)\\n- Individuals with weakened immune systems\\n- Pregnant women\\n- Those with chronic illnesses like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\nComplications from the Flu:\\nAlthough most healthy individuals recover from the flu within a week, it can pose significant complications for high-risk groups. Some complications can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Acute respiratory distress syndrome\\n- Worsening of chronic health problems\\n- Role of the flu in various serious medical conditions like sepsis and toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\nPrevention:\\nVaccination is the primary tool for preventing influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu shot for everyone aged 6 months and older. The flu vaccine can reduce the risk of getting the flu, the chance of severe illness, and even the risk of hospitalization.\\n\\nControl Measures:\\nOther preventive measures include:\\n- Regular hand washing\\n- Avoiding touching one's face\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes\\n- Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects \\n- Staying home when feeling unwell to prevent the spread of infection.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nWhile most cases are manageable at home, antiviral medications can be effective if administered within the first two days of symptoms appearing. Staying adequately hydrated and resting are also essential components of care.\\n\\nProblematic symptoms that warrant emergency care include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion, or symptoms that improve but then return.\\n\\nSources:\\n- CDC: [Influenza (Flu)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- Mayo Clinic: [Influenza (Flu) Symptoms and Causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year.\\nSymptoms\\nFlu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these signs and symptoms:\\nfever* or feeling feverish/chills\\ncough\\nsore throat\\nrunny or stuffy nose\\nmuscle or body aches\\nheadaches\\nfatigue (tiredness)\\nsome people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.\\n*It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.\\nNot everyone with flu has symptoms\\nSome people with influenza virus infections do not develop any symptoms at all. A household study conducted during the 2017-2023 flu seasons found that 8 percent of people who tested positive for flu did not have symptoms.\\nKeep Reading:\\nSimilarities and Differences between Flu and COVID-19\\nHow long it takes for signs to show\\nPeriod of Contagiousness\\nYou may be able to spread flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as when you are sick with symptoms.\\nPeople with flu are most contagious during the first three days of their illness.\\nSome otherwise healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning one day before symptoms develop and up to five to seven days after becoming sick.\\nSome people, including young children and people with weakened immune systems, may be contagious for longer periods of time.\\nOnset of Symptoms\\nThe time from when a person is exposed and infected with influenza virus to when symptoms begin is about two days but can range from about one to four days.\\nPeople at risk\\nAnyone can get flu (including healthy people), and serious problems related to flu can happen at any age, but some people are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick. This includes people 65 years and older, people of any age with certain chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease),  people with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m 2  or higher , those who are pregnant, and children younger than five years.\\nHow it spreads\\nMost experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.\\nPrevention\\nThe first and most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccine each year. Flu vaccine has been shown to reduce flu-related illnesses and the risk of serious flu complications that can result in hospitalization or even death. CDC also recommends everyday preventive actions (like staying away from people who are sick (distancing) , covering coughs and sneezes, frequent handwashing , and taking steps for cleaner air ) to help slow the spread of germs that cause respiratory (nose, throat, and lungs) illnesses like flu. More information is available about core and additional prevention strategies .\\nQuick facts\\nU.S annual flu infection rates\\nA 2018 CDC study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases looked at the percentage of the U.S. population who got sick with flu using two different methods and compared the findings. Both methods had similar findings, which suggested that on average, about 8 percent of the U.S. population gets sick from flu each season, with a range of between 3 percent and 11 percent, depending on the season.\\nGroups most likely to get sick from flu\\nThe same CID study found that children are most likely to get sick from flu and that people 65 and older are least likely to get sick from flu. Median incidence values (or attack rate) by age group were 9.3% for children 0-17 years, 8.8% for adults 18-64 years, and 3.9% for adults 65 years and older. This means that children younger than 18 are more than twice as likely to develop a symptomatic influenza virus infection than adults 65 and older.\\nEstimating seasonal flu incidence\\nInfluenza virus infection is very common, and the number of people infected each season can only be estimated because not everyone will seek medical care or get tested for flu. Statistical estimations are based on  CDC-measured flu hospitalization rates  that are adjusted to estimate the total number of influenza virus infections in the United States for a given flu season.\\nThe estimates for the number of influenza virus infections are then divided by the census population to estimate how common influenza virus infections are in the population (called seasonal incidence or attack rate).\\nImpact of flu season severity on incidence of flu\\nThe proportion of people who get sick with flu varies.  A paper published in CID  found that between 3 percent and 11 percent of the U.S. population gets infected and develops flu symptoms each year. The 3 percent estimate is from the 2011-2012 season, which was an H1N1-predominant season classified as being of low severity. The estimated incidence of flu illness during two seasons was around 11 percent; 2012-2013 was an H3N2-predominant season classified as being of moderate severity, while 2014-2015 was an H3N2 predominant season classified as being of high severity.\\nTable 1.

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu can lead to mild to severe illness and, in some cases, can result in death.\\n\\nSymptoms of Influenza:\\nFlu symptoms typically begin abruptly and can include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Muscle or body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Feeling very tired\\n- Sweating and chills\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms like ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may also occur.\\n\\nHow Influenza Spreads:\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces that have been contaminated and then touching their mouth, eyes, or nose. One can start spreading the virus to others from approximately one day before symptoms appear and up to 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\nRisk Factors:\\nCertain groups are at a higher risk for complications from the flu, including:\\n- Young children (especially under 2 years)\\n- Elderly adults (over 65 years)\\n- Individuals with weakened immune systems\\n- Pregnant women\\n- Those with chronic illnesses like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\nComplications from the Flu:\\nAlthough most healthy individuals recover from the flu within a week, it can pose significant complications for high-risk groups. Some complications can include:\\n- Pneumonia\\n- Acute respiratory distress syndrome\\n- Worsening of chronic health problems\\n- Role of the flu in various serious medical conditions like sepsis and toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\nPrevention:\\nVaccination is the primary tool for preventing influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu shot for everyone aged 6 months and older. The flu vaccine can reduce the risk of getting the flu, the chance of severe illness, and even the risk of hospitalization.\\n\\nControl Measures:\\nOther preventive measures include:\\n- Regular hand washing\\n- Avoiding touching one's face\\n- Covering coughs and sneezes\\n- Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects \\n- Staying home when feeling unwell to prevent the spread of infection.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nWhile most cases are manageable at home, antiviral medications can be effective if administered within the first two days of symptoms appearing. Staying adequately hydrated and resting are also essential components of care.\\n\\nProblematic symptoms that warrant emergency care include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion, or symptoms that improve but then return.\\n\\nSources:\\n- CDC: [Influenza (Flu)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.html)\\n- Mayo Clinic: [Influenza (Flu) Symptoms and Causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719)\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year.\\nSymptoms\\nFlu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these signs and symptoms:\\nfever* or feeling feverish/chills\\ncough\\nsore throat\\nrunny or stuffy nose\\nmuscle or body aches\\nheadaches\\nfatigue (tiredness)\\nsome people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.\\n*It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.\\nNot everyone with flu has symptoms\\nSome people with influenza virus infections do not develop any symptoms at all. A household study conducted during the 2017-2023 flu seasons found that 8 percent of people who tested positive for flu did not have symptoms.\\nKeep Reading:\\nSimilarities and Differences between Flu and COVID-19\\nHow long it takes for signs to show\\nPeriod of Contagiousness\\nYou may be able to spread flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as when you are sick with symptoms.\\nPeople with flu are most contagious during the first three days of their illness.\\nSome otherwise healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning one day before symptoms develop and up to five to seven days after becoming sick.\\nSome people, including young children and people with weakened immune systems, may be contagious for longer periods of time.\\nOnset of Symptoms\\nThe time from when a person is exposed and infected with influenza virus to when symptoms begin is about two days but can range from about one to four days.\\nPeople at risk\\nAnyone can get flu (including healthy people), and serious problems related to flu can happen at any age, but some people are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick. This includes people 65 years and older, people of any age with certain chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease),  people with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m 2  or higher , those who are pregnant, and children younger than five years.\\nHow it spreads\\nMost experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.\\nPrevention\\nThe first and most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccine each year. Flu vaccine has been shown to reduce flu-related illnesses and the risk of serious flu complications that can result in hospitalization or even death. CDC also recommends everyday preventive actions (like staying away from people who are sick (distancing) , covering coughs and sneezes, frequent handwashing , and taking steps for cleaner air ) to help slow the spread of germs that cause respiratory (nose, throat, and lungs) illnesses like flu. More information is available about core and additional prevention strategies .\\nQuick facts\\nU.S annual flu infection rates\\nA 2018 CDC study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases looked at the percentage of the U.S. population who got sick with flu using two different methods and compared the findings. Both methods had similar findings, which suggested that on average, about 8 percent of the U.S. population gets sick from flu each season, with a range of between 3 percent and 11 percent, depending on the season.\\nGroups most likely to get sick from flu\\nThe same CID study found that children are most likely to get sick from flu and that people 65 and older are least likely to get sick from flu. Median incidence values (or attack rate) by age group were 9.3% for children 0-17 years, 8.8% for adults 18-64 years, and 3.9% for adults 65 years and older. This means that children younger than 18 are more than twice as likely to develop a symptomatic influenza virus infection than adults 65 and older.\\nEstimating seasonal flu incidence\\nInfluenza virus infection is very common, and the number of people infected each season can only be estimated because not everyone will seek medical care or get tested for flu. Statistical estimations are based on  CDC-measured flu hospitalization rates  that are adjusted to estimate the total number of influenza virus infections in the United States for a given flu season.\\nThe estimates for the number of influenza virus infections are then divided by the census population to estimate how common influenza virus infections are in the population (called seasonal incidence or attack rate).\\nImpact of flu season severity on incidence of flu\\nThe proportion of people who get sick with flu varies.  A paper published in CID  found that between 3 percent and 11 percent of the U.S. population gets infected and develops flu symptoms each year. The 3 percent estimate is from the 2011-2012 season, which was an H1N1-predominant season classified as being of low severity. The estimated incidence of flu illness during two seasons was around 11 percent; 2012-2013 was an H3N2-predominant season classified as being of moderate severity, while 2014-2015 was an H3N2 predominant season classified as being of high severity.\\nTable 1.

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

Overview of Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect the nose, throat, and lungs. The flu is characterized by its abrupt onset and can lead to mild to severe illness. In some cases, it can result in death, especially among high-risk groups. The flu typically circulates in seasonal epidemics, with a usual peak from October to May in North America. \\n\\nThe best method to mitigate the impacts of seasonal flu is through annual vaccination, which helps protect against the strains of the virus expected to be most prevalent in the upcoming season.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms of Influenza\\nFlu symptoms often appear suddenly and can include the following:\\n- **Fever or chills**: Many affected individuals may experience fever, although not everyone with the flu will have a fever.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent cough is common.\\n- **Sore throat**: Soreness in the throat is frequently reported.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: This may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Muscle or body aches**: General discomfort and bodily pain are common.\\n- **Headaches**: Headaches can be a significant symptom.\\n- **Fatigue (tiredness)**: Many individuals report extreme fatigue with the flu.\\n- **Sweating and chills**: Sweating, coupled with chills, is also often seen.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms such as ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may occur more frequently than in adults.\\n\\n## 3. How Influenza Spreads\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also be contracted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Notably, individuals can begin spreading the virus to others approximately one day before symptoms appear and can continue to do so for 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors for Complications\\nCertain populations are at greater risk for severe flu complications:\\n- **Young children**, especially those under 2 years old.\\n- **Elderly adults**, particularly those over 65 years old.\\n- Individuals with **weakened immune systems**.\\n- **Pregnant women**.\\n- People with **chronic medical conditions** such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\n## 5. Complications from the Flu\\nWhile many healthy individuals will recover within a week, flu can cause significant complications for high-risk groups. Possible complications include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: A severe respiratory infection that can be life-threatening.\\n- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: A serious condition affecting breathing.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health issues**: Conditions such as asthma or heart disease can deteriorate following a flu infection.\\n- **Secondary bacterial infections**: Such as sinus infections or ear infections.\\n- **Sepsis or toxic shock syndrome**: These serious conditions can also arise from influenza infection.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention of Influenza\\nVaccination is the cornerstone of flu prevention. The CDC recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive an annual flu shot, which significantly reduces the risk of illness, severe complications, and hospitalization.\\n\\n### Additional preventive measures include:\\n- **Hand washing**: Regular washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.\\n- **Avoiding face touching**: Keeping hands away from the eyes, nose, and mouth.\\n- **Covering coughs and sneezes**: Using tissues or elbows to minimize the spread of droplets.\\n- **Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces**: This reduces the chance of contamination.\\n- **Staying home when unwell**: This is crucial to prevent spreading the virus to others.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment of Influenza\\nMost flu cases can be treated at home with rest and fluids; however, antiviral medications can be effective if taken within the first two days of symptom onset. These medications can shorten the duration of illness and help prevent complications.\\n\\n**Emergency symptoms** that necessitate immediate medical attention include:\\n- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\\n- Chest pain or pressure.\\n- Confusion or dizziness.\\n- Severe dehydration or persistent symptoms that worsen.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines and being aware of influenza's symptoms and transmission, individuals can play an important role in reducing the incidence and severity of the flu during outbreak seasons.\\n```\\n\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"```\\nThought: Now that I have gathered detailed information from both the CDC and the Mayo Clinic, I can synthesize this information into a comprehensive report covering various aspects of Influenza (flu).\\nFinal Answer: \\n# Influenza (Flu) Report\\n\\n## 1.

Overview of Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect the nose, throat, and lungs. The flu is characterized by its abrupt onset and can lead to mild to severe illness. In some cases, it can result in death, especially among high-risk groups. The flu typically circulates in seasonal epidemics, with a usual peak from October to May in North America. \\n\\nThe best method to mitigate the impacts of seasonal flu is through annual vaccination, which helps protect against the strains of the virus expected to be most prevalent in the upcoming season.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms of Influenza\\nFlu symptoms often appear suddenly and can include the following:\\n- **Fever or chills**: Many affected individuals may experience fever, although not everyone with the flu will have a fever.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent cough is common.\\n- **Sore throat**: Soreness in the throat is frequently reported.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: This may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Muscle or body aches**: General discomfort and bodily pain are common.\\n- **Headaches**: Headaches can be a significant symptom.\\n- **Fatigue (tiredness)**: Many individuals report extreme fatigue with the flu.\\n- **Sweating and chills**: Sweating, coupled with chills, is also often seen.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms such as ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may occur more frequently than in adults.\\n\\n## 3. How Influenza Spreads\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also be contracted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Notably, individuals can begin spreading the virus to others approximately one day before symptoms appear and can continue to do so for 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors for Complications\\nCertain populations are at greater risk for severe flu complications:\\n- **Young children**, especially those under 2 years old.\\n- **Elderly adults**, particularly those over 65 years old.\\n- Individuals with **weakened immune systems**.\\n- **Pregnant women**.\\n- People with **chronic medical conditions** such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\n## 5. Complications from the Flu\\nWhile many healthy individuals will recover within a week, flu can cause significant complications for high-risk groups. Possible complications include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: A severe respiratory infection that can be life-threatening.\\n- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: A serious condition affecting breathing.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health issues**: Conditions such as asthma or heart disease can deteriorate following a flu infection.\\n- **Secondary bacterial infections**: Such as sinus infections or ear infections.\\n- **Sepsis or toxic shock syndrome**: These serious conditions can also arise from influenza infection.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention of Influenza\\nVaccination is the cornerstone of flu prevention. The CDC recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive an annual flu shot, which significantly reduces the risk of illness, severe complications, and hospitalization.\\n\\n### Additional preventive measures include:\\n- **Hand washing**: Regular washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.\\n- **Avoiding face touching**: Keeping hands away from the eyes, nose, and mouth.\\n- **Covering coughs and sneezes**: Using tissues or elbows to minimize the spread of droplets.\\n- **Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces**: This reduces the chance of contamination.\\n- **Staying home when unwell**: This is crucial to prevent spreading the virus to others.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment of Influenza\\nMost flu cases can be treated at home with rest and fluids; however, antiviral medications can be effective if taken within the first two days of symptom onset. These medications can shorten the duration of illness and help prevent complications.\\n\\n**Emergency symptoms** that necessitate immediate medical attention include:\\n- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\\n- Chest pain or pressure.\\n- Confusion or dizziness.\\n- Severe dehydration or persistent symptoms that worsen.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines and being aware of influenza's symptoms and transmission, individuals can play an important role in reducing the incidence and severity of the flu during outbreak seasons.\\n```\", \"tools\": []}", "id": "\"1c6a4606-29b8-4d2d-99f3-1f342369efbf\"", "formatting_errors": "\"0\"", "role": "\"Influenza (Flu) Senior Summarizer\\n\"", "goal": "\"Generate a summary with the most important information about Influenza (Flu)\\n\"", "backstory": "\"You're a report writer who organizes incoming information well, creates concise texts and translates from technical terms to more common ones.

Early Localized Disease (Stage 1):\\n- **Erythema migrans rash:** A distinct bull’s-eye rash appearing around the bite area.\\n- Fever\\n- Chills\\n- Fatigue\\n- Muscle and joint pain\\n- Swollen lymph nodes\\n\\n### 2. Early Disseminated Disease (Stage 2):\\n- Multiple rashes appearing on various body parts\\n- Neurological issues: such as facial paralysis, stiffness, and intense headaches\\n- Heart problems: including irregular heartbeats (known as Lyme carditis)\\n- Pain in muscles and joints \\n\\n### 3. Late Disseminated Disease (Stage 3):\\n- Ongoing arthritis, especially in the knees\\n- Persistent neurological symptoms, like memory issues and problems sleeping.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\n- Lyme disease is diagnosed based on physical signs (like the bull’s-eye rash), history of potential tick exposure, and lab tests. \\n- The CDC recommends a two-step blood test process to confirm the diagnosis.\\n\\n## Treatment\\n- Antibiotics are effective in treating Lyme disease. \\n- If caught early, individuals often recover completely, although some may experience lingering symptoms known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS).\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo prevent Lyme disease, you can:\\n- Use insect repellent with DEET or permethrin on your skin and clothes.\\n- Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants when you’re in areas with tall grass or woods.\\n- Check your body for ticks after spending time outdoors.\\n- Contact your healthcare provider if you have been bitten by a tick or if you show symptoms.\\n\\n## Complications\\nIf Lyme disease is not treated, it can lead to serious complications, including:\\n- Long-term joint pain\\n- Neurological problems\\n- Chronic fatigue\\n\\n## Current Observations and Data\\n- There has been an increase in confirmed cases of Lyme disease.

This disease is commonly found in parts of the northeastern, north-central, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States, as well as in some areas of Europe and Canada.\\n\\n## Causes\\n- Lyme disease is caused by the **Borrelia burgdorferi** bacterium.\\n- Ticks get this bacterium from biting infected animals, such as deer and rodents.\\n- Humans usually get infected when ticks bite them and stay attached for more than 24 hours.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nLyme disease symptoms can show up in different stages, typically appearing between 3 to 30 days after a tick bite.\\n\\n### 1. Early Localized Disease (Stage 1):\\n- **Erythema migrans rash:** A distinct bull’s-eye rash appearing around the bite area.\\n- Fever\\n- Chills\\n- Fatigue\\n- Muscle and joint pain\\n- Swollen lymph nodes\\n\\n### 2. Early Disseminated Disease (Stage 2):\\n- Multiple rashes appearing on various body parts\\n- Neurological issues: such as facial paralysis, stiffness, and intense headaches\\n- Heart problems: including irregular heartbeats (known as Lyme carditis)\\n- Pain in muscles and joints \\n\\n### 3. Late Disseminated Disease (Stage 3):\\n- Ongoing arthritis, especially in the knees\\n- Persistent neurological symptoms, like memory issues and problems sleeping.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\n- Lyme disease is diagnosed based on physical signs (like the bull’s-eye rash), history of potential tick exposure, and lab tests. \\n- The CDC recommends a two-step blood test process to confirm the diagnosis.\\n\\n## Treatment\\n- Antibiotics are effective in treating Lyme disease. \\n- If caught early, individuals often recover completely, although some may experience lingering symptoms known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS).\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo prevent Lyme disease, you can:\\n- Use insect repellent with DEET or permethrin on your skin and clothes.\\n- Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants when you’re in areas with tall grass or woods.\\n- Check your body for ticks after spending time outdoors.\\n- Contact your healthcare provider if you have been bitten by a tick or if you show symptoms.\\n\\n## Complications\\nIf Lyme disease is not treated, it can lead to serious complications, including:\\n- Long-term joint pain\\n- Neurological problems\\n- Chronic fatigue\\n\\n## Current Observations and Data\\n- There has been an increase in confirmed cases of Lyme disease. This rise is attributed to environmental changes and people spending more time in tick-friendly areas.\\n\\n## Web Resources\\nFor more detailed information, visit:\\n- [CDC Lyme Disease Information](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html)\\n- [Mayo Clinic Lyme Disease Overview](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651)\\n\\nBy staying informed and taking precautions, individuals can lower their chances of contracting Lyme disease and will be better equipped to seek timely treatment if they suspect an infection.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Lyme Disease Senior Summarizer\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}], \"token_usage\": {\"total_tokens\": 18670, \"prompt_tokens\": 15932, \"cached_prompt_tokens\": 1024, \"completion_tokens\": 2738, \"successful_requests\": 7}}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Task.execute_sync_7", "context": {"span_id": "0x6b6576d3b1ea053c", "trace_id": "0x6e6648ef59d6075daca44ae956fbc770"}, "parent_id": "0x195bdf51b55e9aff", "start_time": 1742219377692267639, "end_time": 1742219388186515590, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"ef7aef6200704343a56717e257cab137\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"CHAIN\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"\", \"tools\": [{\"name\": \"Search the internet with Serper\", \"description\": \"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion.

The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

It is prevalent in the northeastern, north-central, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States, as well as in parts of Europe and Canada.\\n\\n**Causes:**\\n- The causative agent of Lyme disease is the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium. Ticks acquire the bacteria from infected animals (such as deer and rodents) and can then transmit it to humans through their bites.\\n- Ticks can transmit the bacteria when they attach to a host for an extended period, typically more than 24 hours.\\n\\n**Symptoms:**\\n- Symptoms appear in stages and can vary widely. They generally begin to show within 3 to 30 days after being bitten by an infected tick.\\n  \\n1. **Early Localized Disease (Stage 1):**\\n   - Erythema migrans rash: A characteristic bull’s-eye rash that may appear at the site of the tick bite.\\n   - Fever\\n   - Chills\\n   - Fatigue\\n   - Muscle and joint pain\\n   - Swollen lymph nodes\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Disease (Stage 2)** \\n   - Multiple rashes on different parts of the body\\n   - Neurological symptoms: Facial palsy, stiffness, and severe headaches\\n   - Heart issues: Irregular heartbeat (Lyme carditis)\\n   - Pain in the joints and muscles \\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Disease (Stage 3):**\\n   - Persistent arthritis, particularly in the knees\\n   - Neurological symptoms may persist, including cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbances.\\n\\n**Diagnosis:**\\n- Diagnosis is often based on physical findings (such as the erythema migrans rash), history of tick exposure, and laboratory tests. There’s typically a two-step serologic testing process recommended by the CDC for confirmation.\\n\\n**Treatment:**\\n- Lyme disease is treatable with antibiotics. Early treatment usually leads to a full recovery, but longer-lasting symptoms can occur even after successful treatment, referred to as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS).\\n\\n**Prevention:**\\n- Preventive measures include:\\n  - Using insect repellent containing DEET or permethrin on clothes and skin.\\n  - Wearing long sleeves and pants when in wooded or grassy areas.\\n  - Performing thorough tick checks after outdoor activities.\\n  - Consulting healthcare providers if exposed to ticks or developing symptoms.\\n\\n**Complications:**\\n- If untreated, Lyme disease can lead to severe complications, including long-term joint pain, neurological issues, and chronic fatigue.\\n\\n**Current Observations and Data:**\\n- Trends in Lyme disease incidence show an upward trajectory in confirmed cases due to environmental changes and increased exposure to tick habitats.\\n\\n**Web Resources:**\\n- For a more in-depth understanding, you can explore information from the CDC ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html)) and the Mayo Clinic ([source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651)).\\n\\nBy taking these proactive steps and staying informed, individuals can reduce their risk of Lyme disease and seek prompt treatment if they suspect infection.\\n```\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"```\\nThought: I have gathered sufficient detailed information about Lyme Disease from trusted sources.

They generally begin to show within 3 to 30 days after being bitten by an infected tick.\\n  \\n1. **Early Localized Disease (Stage 1):**\\n   - Erythema migrans rash: A characteristic bull’s-eye rash that may appear at the site of the tick bite.\\n   - Fever\\n   - Chills\\n   - Fatigue\\n   - Muscle and joint pain\\n   - Swollen lymph nodes\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Disease (Stage 2)** \\n   - Multiple rashes on different parts of the body\\n   - Neurological symptoms: Facial palsy, stiffness, and severe headaches\\n   - Heart issues: Irregular heartbeat (Lyme carditis)\\n   - Pain in the joints and muscles \\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Disease (Stage 3):**\\n   - Persistent arthritis, particularly in the knees\\n   - Neurological symptoms may persist, including cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbances.\\n\\n**Diagnosis:**\\n- Diagnosis is often based on physical findings (such as the erythema migrans rash), history of tick exposure, and laboratory tests. There’s typically a two-step serologic testing process recommended by the CDC for confirmation.\\n\\n**Treatment:**\\n- Lyme disease is treatable with antibiotics. Early treatment usually leads to a full recovery, but longer-lasting symptoms can occur even after successful treatment, referred to as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS).\\n\\n**Prevention:**\\n- Preventive measures include:\\n  - Using insect repellent containing DEET or permethrin on clothes and skin.\\n  - Wearing long sleeves and pants when in wooded or grassy areas.\\n  - Performing thorough tick checks after outdoor activities.\\n  - Consulting healthcare providers if exposed to ticks or developing symptoms.\\n\\n**Complications:**\\n- If untreated, Lyme disease can lead to severe complications, including long-term joint pain, neurological issues, and chronic fatigue.\\n\\n**Current Observations and Data:**\\n- Trends in Lyme disease incidence show an upward trajectory in confirmed cases due to environmental changes and increased exposure to tick habitats.\\n\\n**Web Resources:**\\n- For a more in-depth understanding, you can explore information from the CDC ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html)) and the Mayo Clinic ([source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651)).\\n\\nBy taking these proactive steps and staying informed, individuals can reduce their risk of Lyme disease and seek prompt treatment if they suspect infection.\\n```\", \"tools\": [{\"name\": \"Search the internet with Serper\", \"description\": \"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

It is prevalent in the northeastern, north-central, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States, as well as in parts of Europe and Canada.\\n\\n**Causes:**\\n- The causative agent of Lyme disease is the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium. Ticks acquire the bacteria from infected animals (such as deer and rodents) and can then transmit it to humans through their bites.\\n- Ticks can transmit the bacteria when they attach to a host for an extended period, typically more than 24 hours.\\n\\n**Symptoms:**\\n- Symptoms appear in stages and can vary widely. They generally begin to show within 3 to 30 days after being bitten by an infected tick.\\n  \\n1. **Early Localized Disease (Stage 1):**\\n   - Erythema migrans rash: A characteristic bull’s-eye rash that may appear at the site of the tick bite.\\n   - Fever\\n   - Chills\\n   - Fatigue\\n   - Muscle and joint pain\\n   - Swollen lymph nodes\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Disease (Stage 2)** \\n   - Multiple rashes on different parts of the body\\n   - Neurological symptoms: Facial palsy, stiffness, and severe headaches\\n   - Heart issues: Irregular heartbeat (Lyme carditis)\\n   - Pain in the joints and muscles \\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Disease (Stage 3):**\\n   - Persistent arthritis, particularly in the knees\\n   - Neurological symptoms may persist, including cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbances.\\n\\n**Diagnosis:**\\n- Diagnosis is often based on physical findings (such as the erythema migrans rash), history of tick exposure, and laboratory tests. There’s typically a two-step serologic testing process recommended by the CDC for confirmation.\\n\\n**Treatment:**\\n- Lyme disease is treatable with antibiotics. Early treatment usually leads to a full recovery, but longer-lasting symptoms can occur even after successful treatment, referred to as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS).\\n\\n**Prevention:**\\n- Preventive measures include:\\n  - Using insect repellent containing DEET or permethrin on clothes and skin.\\n  - Wearing long sleeves and pants when in wooded or grassy areas.\\n  - Performing thorough tick checks after outdoor activities.\\n  - Consulting healthcare providers if exposed to ticks or developing symptoms.\\n\\n**Complications:**\\n- If untreated, Lyme disease can lead to severe complications, including long-term joint pain, neurological issues, and chronic fatigue.\\n\\n**Current Observations and Data:**\\n- Trends in Lyme disease incidence show an upward trajectory in confirmed cases due to environmental changes and increased exposure to tick habitats.\\n\\n**Web Resources:**\\n- For a more in-depth understanding, you can explore information from the CDC ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html)) and the Mayo Clinic ([source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651)).\\n\\nBy taking these proactive steps and staying informed, individuals can reduce their risk of Lyme disease and seek prompt treatment if they suspect infection.\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

The primary vector for this disease is the blacklegged tick, commonly known as the deer tick. Lyme disease is most commonly found in the northeastern, north-central, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States, as well as in specific areas of Europe and Canada, making it a public health concern in these regions.\\n\\n#### Causes\\nThe primary causative agent of Lyme disease is the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium. These ticks typically acquire the bacteria from biting infected mammals, such as deer and rodents. Human infection occurs when a tick, already infected with Borrelia, attaches to the skin and feeds on the host's blood. Notably, transmission of the bacterium usually requires the tick to be attached to the skin for more than 24 hours, highlighting the importance of early removal of ticks once discovered.\\n\\n#### Symptoms\\nSymptoms of Lyme disease are categorized into stages, with variability in presentation. They generally emerge within a window of 3 to 30 days post-bite.\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Disease (Stage 1)**\\n   - **Erythema migrans rash:** Often presenting as a distinctive bull's-eye pattern, the rash is typically located at the tick bite site and may expand over time.\\n   - **Systemic Symptoms:** Individuals may experience fever, chills, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes, reflecting the body's systemic response to the infection.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Disease (Stage 2)**\\n   - **Rash Variability:** Multiple erythema migrans rashes can emerge on various body parts.\\n   - **Neurological Effects:** Patients may exhibit neurological symptoms, including facial palsy (weakness in the facial muscles), stiffness, and severe headaches often termed \\\"Lyme neuroborreliosis.\\\"\\n   - **Cardiac Complications:** Lyme carditis, an irregular heartbeat condition, can develop and necessitates immediate medical attention.\\n   - **Musculoskeletal Complaints:** Individuals may continue to experience significant pain in the joints and muscles at this stage.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Disease (Stage 3)**\\n   - **Persistent Arthritis:** Chronic arthritis, particularly in the knees, is a hallmark of this stage.\\n   - **Neurological Manifestations:** Cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbances may persist, indicating ongoing neurological impact from the disease.\\n\\n#### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease effectively combines clinical examination and lab testing. A notable aspect includes recognizing the erythema migrans rash characteristic of early disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) typically endorses a two-step serologic test approach for diagnosis confirmation, especially when symptoms are ambiguous or absent. This approach includes an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by a Western blot test to detect antibodies against Borrelia.\\n\\n#### Treatment\\nLyme disease is treatable, primarily with antibiotic therapy, which is most effective when administered in the early stages. Doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime axetil are common antibiotic options. Although many patients recover completely with appropriate treatment, some may experience lingering symptoms, collectively termed post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which can include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive difficulties that last for months or even longer.\\n\\n#### Prevention\\nPreventive measures are critical in reducing the risk of Lyme disease. Effective strategies include:\\n- Application of insect repellent containing DEET or permethrin on clothing and exposed skin before engaging in outdoor activities.\\n- Wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants when traversing wooded or grassy areas.\\n- Conducting thorough tick checks on oneself and pets after spending time in tick-infested environments.\\n- Consulting with healthcare providers if tick bites are suspected or symptoms associated with Lyme disease develop.\\n\\n#### Complications\\nIf not addressed promptly, Lyme disease can escalate to severe complications. Late-stage complications may involve chronic joint pain (Lyme arthritis), neurological issues (peripheral neuropathy, cognitive difficulties), and chronic fatigue, which can significantly impair quality of life.\\n\\n#### Current Observations and Data\\nRecent surveillance data indicate an upward trend of reported Lyme disease cases in the United States, attributed to environmental changes and increased human-tick interactions. As of 2022, the incidence rate was 18.9 cases per 100,000 population, reflecting a substantial increase compared to prior years (11.2 cases per 100,000 in 2017-2019).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) typically endorses a two-step serologic test approach for diagnosis confirmation, especially when symptoms are ambiguous or absent. This approach includes an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by a Western blot test to detect antibodies against Borrelia.\\n\\n#### Treatment\\nLyme disease is treatable, primarily with antibiotic therapy, which is most effective when administered in the early stages. Doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime axetil are common antibiotic options. Although many patients recover completely with appropriate treatment, some may experience lingering symptoms, collectively termed post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which can include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive difficulties that last for months or even longer.\\n\\n#### Prevention\\nPreventive measures are critical in reducing the risk of Lyme disease. Effective strategies include:\\n- Application of insect repellent containing DEET or permethrin on clothing and exposed skin before engaging in outdoor activities.\\n- Wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants when traversing wooded or grassy areas.\\n- Conducting thorough tick checks on oneself and pets after spending time in tick-infested environments.\\n- Consulting with healthcare providers if tick bites are suspected or symptoms associated with Lyme disease develop.\\n\\n#### Complications\\nIf not addressed promptly, Lyme disease can escalate to severe complications. Late-stage complications may involve chronic joint pain (Lyme arthritis), neurological issues (peripheral neuropathy, cognitive difficulties), and chronic fatigue, which can significantly impair quality of life.\\n\\n#### Current Observations and Data\\nRecent surveillance data indicate an upward trend of reported Lyme disease cases in the United States, attributed to environmental changes and increased human-tick interactions. As of 2022, the incidence rate was 18.9 cases per 100,000 population, reflecting a substantial increase compared to prior years (11.2 cases per 100,000 in 2017-2019). Understanding these trends is essential to inform public health strategies and raise awareness regarding Lyme disease.\\n\\n#### Web Resources\\nFor further reading and in-depth understanding, individuals are encouraged to explore the following resources:\\n- CDC Lyme Disease Overview: [CDC Lyme Disease](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html)\\n- Mayo Clinic on Lyme Disease: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651)\\n\\nBy maintaining proactive measures and staying informed about Lyme disease, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of infection and promote early intervention upon symptom onset.\\n```  \\n\\nThought: I now know the final answer  \\nFinal Answer: The comprehensive report on Lyme disease, detailing its definition, causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, complications, current observations, and resources for further reading.\"}}", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "null"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Task.execute_sync_9", "context": {"span_id": "0x3141e6ef49bc833d", "trace_id": "0x6e6648ef59d6075daca44ae956fbc770"}, "parent_id": "0x195bdf51b55e9aff", "start_time": 1742219422174769533, "end_time": 1742219433273977753, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"ef7aef6200704343a56717e257cab137\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"CHAIN\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"### Lyme Disease: Comprehensive Overview\\n\\n**Definition:**\\nLyme disease is an infection caused by the Borrelia bacteria, primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (deer tick).

This reaction leads to symptoms that resemble a cold, such as sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus discomfort. Common triggers for hay fever include pollen from trees, grass, pet fur, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nPeople with hay fever may experience several symptoms, which can significantly disrupt daily life. These include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A rapid expulsion of air from the nose that occurs due to nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny Nose**: Often produces clear mucus.\\n- **Nasal Congestion**: Difficulty breathing through the nose due to swelling and inflammation.\\n- **Itchy Eyes/Nose/Throat**: Leads to discomfort and redness, often associated with swelling.\\n- **Watery Eyes**: Increased tearing as a response to allergens.\\n- **Postnasal Drip**: Mucus accumulation in the throat, leading to coughing, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Often results from poor sleep quality when nasal passages are congested.\\n\\nThe severity and timing of these symptoms can differ based on individual reactions and the presence of specific allergens throughout different seasons.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by several allergens which can be categorized into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: \\n  - **Tree Pollen**: Common in spring.\\n  - **Grass Pollen**: Peaks in summer.\\n  - **Ragweed Pollen**: Found in late summer and fall.\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: \\n  - **Dust Mites**: Tiny creatures that thrive in household dust.\\n  - **Pet Dander**: Flecks of skin shed by furry pets.\\n  - **Cockroach Droppings**: Waste matter from cockroaches.\\n  - **Mold Spores**: Produced by mold, especially in damp conditions.\\n- **Irritants**: Such as cigarette smoke, strong smells (like perfume), cleaning products, and pollution may cause or exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and avoiding these triggers is essential for effective management of hay fever.\\n\\n## Causes\\nHay fever happens when the immune system mistakenly perceives normally harmless substances as dangerous. This leads to the production of specific antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). When these antibodies meet the allergens, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which is responsible for most of the allergic symptoms.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally requires:\\n- A thorough discussion of the patient's medical history and current symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests (such as skin prick tests or blood tests) to pinpoint specific allergens.\\n- Assessments for any related complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nAccurate diagnosis is crucial to determining the most effective treatment plan.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe first step for managing hay fever is to minimize contact with known allergens:\\n- **Keep Windows Closed**: During high pollen seasons.\\n- **Use Air Conditioning**: Helps filter out allergens.\\n- **Wear Sunglasses**: Outdoors to shield eyes from pollen.\\n- **Limit Indoor Exposure**: Keep pets out of sleeping areas and frequently clean to reduce allergen accumulation.\\n\\n### 2.

When exposed to these allergens, the body produces an inflammatory response similar to that of a cold, resulting in symptoms such as sneezing, nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus pressure. Common triggers include pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites. Given its widespread impact, hay fever affects millions globally and can significantly impair one's quality of life.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can be both bothersome and debilitating. Common manifestations include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A reflex action resulting from nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny nose**: Typically accompanied by clear discharge.\\n- **Nasal congestion**: Leads to difficulty breathing through the nose.\\n- **Itchy eyes, throat, or nose**: Often accompanied by redness and swelling.\\n- **Watery eyes**: Increased tearing due to allergic response.\\n- **Postnasal drip**: Leading to cough, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Frequently a result of disrupted sleep due to nasal obstruction.\\n\\nThe severity and presentation of these symptoms can vary based on individual sensitivity to allergens and seasonal variations.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by a variety of allergens, which are typically classified into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: These include tree pollen in spring, grass pollen in summer, and ragweed pollen in late summer and fall. \\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Common year-round triggers include dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, and mold spores.\\n- **Irritants**: Certain environmental factors like cigarette smoke, strong odors (such as perfumes), fumes from cleaning products, and air pollutants can also exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and mitigating exposure to these triggers is crucial in managing the condition.\\n\\n## Causes\\nDuring an allergic reaction, the immune system mistakenly identifies a harmless substance as a threatening allergen. This leads to the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies encounter the allergen, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which cause the myriad of symptoms associated with hay fever.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally involves:\\n- A comprehensive review of the patient’s medical history and reported symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests, which may include skin prick tests or blood tests to identify specific allergens.\\n- In some cases, assessing for related complications such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nA correct diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and management.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe primary strategy in managing hay fever is to avoid known allergens:\\n- Keep windows closed during high pollen seasons and utilize air conditioning.\\n- Wear sunglasses outdoors to shield the eyes from pollen.\\n- Maintain clean environments by using air purifiers and keeping up with regular cleaning schedules to reduce exposure to dust and mold.\\n\\n### 2. Medications\\nMedications to relieve symptoms may include:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Effective for sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Available in oral formats and nasal sprays.\\n- **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Reduce inflammation and are considered the most effective treatment.\\n- **Decongestants**: Alleviate nasal congestion but should be used short-term due to potential rebound effects.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Work to block substances that contribute to the allergic response.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Gradual exposure to allergens can build tolerance and reduce symptoms over time.\\n\\n### 3. Non-Medication Strategies\\nAdditional strategies include:\\n- Nasal saline rinses to flush out irritants.\\n- Use of HEPA filters in home ventilation systems.\\n- Regular washing of bedding and clothing in hot water to eliminate dust mites.\\n\\n## Complications\\nIf hay fever is left unmanaged, complications can arise:\\n- Sleep disturbances leading to daytime fatigue.\\n- Increased likelihood of developing asthma and other allergic conditions.\\n- Potential development of sinusitis or ear infections, particularly in children.\\n\\n## When to See a Doctor\\nPatients should consult a healthcare professional when:\\n- Symptoms significantly disrupt daily living.\\n- Over-the-counter medications fail to provide relief.\\n- There are concerns regarding associated conditions such as asthma.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever is a common yet manageable condition, with a variety of effective treatments available that can significantly enhance an individual’s quality of life. Consulting with an allergist might provide additional insights and guidance on personalized management plans, ensuring optimal control of symptoms.

This reaction leads to symptoms that resemble a cold, such as sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus discomfort. Common triggers for hay fever include pollen from trees, grass, pet fur, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nPeople with hay fever may experience several symptoms, which can significantly disrupt daily life. These include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A rapid expulsion of air from the nose that occurs due to nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny Nose**: Often produces clear mucus.\\n- **Nasal Congestion**: Difficulty breathing through the nose due to swelling and inflammation.\\n- **Itchy Eyes/Nose/Throat**: Leads to discomfort and redness, often associated with swelling.\\n- **Watery Eyes**: Increased tearing as a response to allergens.\\n- **Postnasal Drip**: Mucus accumulation in the throat, leading to coughing, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Often results from poor sleep quality when nasal passages are congested.\\n\\nThe severity and timing of these symptoms can differ based on individual reactions and the presence of specific allergens throughout different seasons.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by several allergens which can be categorized into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: \\n  - **Tree Pollen**: Common in spring.\\n  - **Grass Pollen**: Peaks in summer.\\n  - **Ragweed Pollen**: Found in late summer and fall.\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: \\n  - **Dust Mites**: Tiny creatures that thrive in household dust.\\n  - **Pet Dander**: Flecks of skin shed by furry pets.\\n  - **Cockroach Droppings**: Waste matter from cockroaches.\\n  - **Mold Spores**: Produced by mold, especially in damp conditions.\\n- **Irritants**: Such as cigarette smoke, strong smells (like perfume), cleaning products, and pollution may cause or exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and avoiding these triggers is essential for effective management of hay fever.\\n\\n## Causes\\nHay fever happens when the immune system mistakenly perceives normally harmless substances as dangerous. This leads to the production of specific antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). When these antibodies meet the allergens, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which is responsible for most of the allergic symptoms.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally requires:\\n- A thorough discussion of the patient's medical history and current symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests (such as skin prick tests or blood tests) to pinpoint specific allergens.\\n- Assessments for any related complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nAccurate diagnosis is crucial to determining the most effective treatment plan.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe first step for managing hay fever is to minimize contact with known allergens:\\n- **Keep Windows Closed**: During high pollen seasons.\\n- **Use Air Conditioning**: Helps filter out allergens.\\n- **Wear Sunglasses**: Outdoors to shield eyes from pollen.\\n- **Limit Indoor Exposure**: Keep pets out of sleeping areas and frequently clean to reduce allergen accumulation.\\n\\n### 2. Medications\\nDifferent types of medications can be used to relieve symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Alleviate sneezing, itching, and runny nose.

This condition is caused by the body’s immune system overreacting to airborne allergens such as pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n#### Symptoms\\nCommon symptoms of hay fever include:\\n- Sneezing\\n- Runny nose\\n- Nasal congestion\\n- Itchy eyes, throat, or nose\\n- Watery eyes\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue (which can often be due to poor sleep as a result of nasal obstructions)\\n\\nSymptoms can vary from person to person and may worsen during specific seasons or when exposed to specific allergens.\\n\\n#### Triggers\\nHay fever can arise from various allergens:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: Tree pollen (spring), grass pollen (summer), ragweed pollen (late summer and fall).\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, mold.\\n- **Irritants**: Cigarette smoke, strong odors (e.g., perfume), fumes from cleaning products, air pollutants.\\n\\n#### Causes\\nHay fever occurs when the immune system identifies a harmless substance as a threat and overreacts by producing immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies come into contact with the allergen, the body releases chemicals like histamine, leading to allergic symptoms.\\n\\n#### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of allergic rhinitis involves:\\n- Reviewing medical history and symptoms.\\n- Conducting allergy tests (skin prick tests or blood tests) to identify specific triggers.\\n- Sometimes evaluating for complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps that could exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\n#### Management and Treatment\\n1. **Avoiding Allergens**: The first line of defense is avoiding known triggers. This includes:\\n   - Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n   - Using air conditioning to filter allergens.\\n   - Wearing sunglasses outdoors to protect eyes from pollen.\\n   - Keeping pets out of sleeping areas.\\n\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Help relieve symptoms like sneezing and itching. These can be found in oral form or nasal sprays.\\n   - **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Highly effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n   - **Decongestants**: Help relieve nasal stuffiness but are usually short-term treatments.\\n   - **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block chemicals in the body that contribute to allergic reactions.\\n   - **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can help build tolerance to allergens over time.\\n\\n3. **Non-Medication Strategies**:\\n   - Nasal saline rinses to clear irritants.\\n   - Use of HEPA filters for air purification in homes.\\n   - Regular cleaning to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n#### Complications\\nIf left unmanaged, hay fever can lead to:\\n- Poor sleep quality and daytime fatigue.\\n- Increased risk of developing asthma or other allergic conditions.\\n- Sinusitis or ear infections in some individuals, especially children.\\n\\n#### When to See a Doctor\\nConsult an allergist if:\\n- Symptoms are severe and disrupt daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about associated conditions like asthma or recurrent infections.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nHay fever is a common and manageable condition. Effective treatments are available that can alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Consulting with an allergist can be beneficial in developing a personalized management plan.\\n\\n**Sources**:\\n- Cleveland Clinic [Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever): Symptoms & Treatment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- Mayo Clinic [Hay fever - Symptoms and causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- ACAAI [Hay Fever (Rhinitis) | Symptoms & Treatment](https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/hay-fever/)\\n```\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_25", "context": {"span_id": "0xb1c7c62e843cd1d9", "trace_id": "0x6e6648ef59d6075daca44ae956fbc770"}, "parent_id": "0x0159efe2d693a240", "start_time": 1742219433311425984, "end_time": 1742219434180741425, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"ef7aef6200704343a56717e257cab137\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis) Senior Data Researcher\\n.

Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever?

Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies?

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet.

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

But don’t be misled by the name – you don’t have to be exposed to hay to have symptoms. And hay fever doesn’t cause a fever. Allergic rhinitis develops when the body’s immune system recognizes and overreacts to something in the environment that typically causes no problems in most people. Seasonal: Symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis can occur in spring, summer, and early fall. They are usually caused by allergic sensitivity to airborne mold spores or to pollens from trees, grass, and weeds. Perennial: People with perennial allergic rhinitis experience symptoms year-round. It is generally caused by dust mites, pet hair or dander, cockroaches, or mold. Underlying or hidden food allergies rarely cause perennial nasal symptoms.\\nDoes hay fever have you in its grip?\\nIt’s time for an allergist.\\nFind an Allergist\\nSome people may experience both types of rhinitis, with perennial symptoms getting worse during specific pollen seasons. There are also nonallergic causes for rhinitis including irritants such as cigarette or other smoke, perfumes, cleaning products and other strong odors. It’s time to take control of your allergic rhinitis and start enjoying life again. It’s time to find an allergist. Hay Fever Symptoms Runny nose Itchy eyes, mouth or skin Sneezing Stuffy nose due to blockage or congestion Fatigue (often reported due to poor quality sleep as a result of nasal obstruction) Hay Fever Triggers Outdoor allergens, such as pollens from trees, grass, weeds, and mold spores Indoor allergens, such as pet hair or dander, dust mites and mold Irritants, such as cigarette smoke, perfume, and diesel exhaust Hay Fever Management and Treatment Avoid triggers by making changes to your home and to your behavior. Keep windows closed during high pollen periods; use air conditioning in your home and car. Wear glasses or sunglasses when outdoors to keep pollen out of your eyes. Use “mite-proof” bedding covers to limit exposure to dust mites and a dehumidifier to control mold. (If you smell mildew, you likely have mold). Wash your hands after petting any animal, and have a nonallergic person help with pet grooming, preferably in a well-ventilated area or outside.\\nWhat people don’t realize is most of the over-the-counter medicines are designed for milder allergies. For the people who have more moderate to severe allergy problems, it’s very rare that over the counter medicines are enough. Allergist James Sublett, MD\\nSymptoms People with allergic rhinitis generally experience symptoms after breathing in an allergy-causing substance such as pollen or dust. In the spring, the most common triggers are tree and grass pollen. In the fall, a common allergen is  ragweed  or other weed pollens or outdoor mold. When a sensitive person inhales an allergen, the body’s immune system may react with the following symptoms (listed in order of frequency): Stuffy nose due to blockage or congestion Runny nose or post nasal drainage Itching, usually in the nose, mouth, eyes, or throat Red and watery eyes Puffy, swollen eyelids Sneezing Cough Symptoms also may be triggered by common irritants such as: Cigarette smoke Strong odors, such as perfume, or hair spray and fumes Cleaning solutions, pool chlorine, car exhaust and other air pollutants (i.e., ozone) Air fresheners There are two types of allergic rhinitis: Seasonal: Symptoms can occur in spring, summer, and early fall. They are usually caused by sensitivity to airborne mold spores or to pollens from trees, grasses, or weeds. Perennial: Symptoms occur year-round and are generally caused by sensitivity to  dust mites ,  pet hair  or dander,  cockroaches  or  mold . Allergic rhinitis can be associated with: Decreased concentration and focus Limited activities Decreased decision-making capacity Impaired hand-eye coordination Problems remembering things Irritability Sleep disorders Fatigue Missed days of work or school More motor vehicle accidents More school or work injuries Many parents of children with allergic rhinitis have said that their children are more moody and irritable during allergy season. Since children cannot always express their symptoms verbally, they may express their discomfort by acting up at school and at home. In addition, some children feel that having an allergy is a stigma that separates them from others. It is important that the irritability or other symptoms caused by allergy symptoms are not mistaken for attention deficit disorder. With proper  treatment , symptoms can be kept under control and disruptions in learning and behavior can be avoided. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis have other causes as well, the most customary being the common cold – an example of infectious rhinitis. Most infections are relatively short-lived, with symptoms improving in three to seven days. Many people have recurrent or chronic nasal congestion, excess mucus production, itching and other nasal symptoms similar to those of allergic rhinitis. In those cases, an allergy may not be the cause. Diagnosing Occasional allergies aren’t just something you have to live with. Consulting an  allergist  is the most effective way to diagnose and treat allergic rhinitis symptoms and help you find relief. Your allergist may start by taking a detailed history, looking for clues in your lifestyle that will help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. You’ll be asked, among other things, about your work and home environments (including whether you have a pet) your family’s medical history and the frequency and severity of your symptoms. Sometimes allergic rhinitis can be complicated by several medical conditions, such as a deviated septum (curvature of the bone and cartilage that separate the nostrils) or nasal polyps (abnormal growths inside the nose and sinuses). Any of these conditions will be made worse by catching a cold. Nasal symptoms caused by more than one problem can be difficult to treat, often requiring the cooperation of an allergist and another specialist, such as an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist surgeon). Your allergist may recommend a  skin test , in which small amounts of suspected allergens are introduced into your skin. Skin testing is the easiest, most sensitive, and generally least expensive way of identifying allergens. Types of skin tests Prick or scratch test: In this test, a tiny drop of a possible allergen is pricked or scratched into the skin. Also known as a percutaneous test, this is the most common type of skin test. The results are known within 10 to 20 minutes. Intradermal test: A small amount of a possible allergen is injected under the skin using a thin needle. The site is checked for a reaction after about 20 minutes. This test is typically more sensitive than the prick or scratch test. Management and Treatment Avoidance The first approach in managing seasonal or perennial forms of allergic rhinitis or hay fever should be to avoid the allergens that trigger symptoms, if possible. Outdoor exposure Stay indoors as much as possible when pollen counts are at their peak, usually during the midmorning and early evening (this may vary according to plant pollen), and when wind is  blowing pollens  around. Avoid using window fans that can draw pollens and molds into the house. Wear glasses or sunglasses when outdoors to minimize the amount of pollen getting into your eyes. Don’t hang clothing outdoors to dry; pollen may cling to towels and sheets. Try not to rub your eyes; doing so will irritate them and could make your symptoms worse. Indoor exposure Keep windows closed and use air conditioning in your car and home. Make sure to keep your air conditioning unit clean. Reduce exposure to dust mites, especially in the bedroom. Use “mite-proof” covers for pillows, comforters and duvets, and mattresses and box springs. Wash your bedding frequently, using hot water (at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit). To limit exposure to mold, keep the humidity in your home low (between 30 and 50 percent) and clean your bathrooms, kitchen, and basement regularly. Use a dehumidifier, especially in the basement and in other damp, humid places, and empty and clean it often. If mold is visible, clean it with mild detergent and a 5 percent bleach solution as directed by an allergist. Clean floors with a damp rag or mop, rather than dry-dusting or sweeping. Exposure to pets Wash your hands immediately after petting any animals; wash your clothes after visiting friends with pets. If you are allergic to a  household pet , keep your pet out of your home as much as possible. If the pet must be inside, keep it out of your bedroom so you are not exposed to pet allergens while you sleep. Close the air ducts to your bedroom if you have forced-air or central heating or cooling. Replace carpeting with hardwood, tile, or linoleum, all of which are easier to keep dander-free. Medications Many allergens that trigger allergic rhinitis are airborne, so you can’t always avoid them. If your symptoms can’t be well-controlled by simply avoiding triggers, your allergist may recommend medications that reduce nasal congestion, sneezing, and an itchy and runny nose. They are available in many forms – oral tablets, liquid medication, nasal sprays and eyedrops. Some medications may have side effects, so discuss these treatments with your allergist so they can help you live the life you want. Intranasal corticosteroids Intranasal corticosteroids are the single most effective drug class for treating allergic rhinitis. They can significantly reduce nasal congestion as well as sneezing, itching and a runny nose. Ask your allergist about whether these medications are appropriate and safe for you. These sprays are designed to avoid the side effects that may occur from steroids that are taken by mouth or injection. Take care not to spray the medication against the center portion of the nose (the nasal septum). The most common side effects are local irritation and nasal bleeding. Some older preparations have been shown to have some effect on children’s growth; data about some newer steroids don’t indicate an effect on growth. Antihistamines Antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergic rhinitis. These medications counter the effects of histamine , the irritating chemical released within your body when an allergic reaction takes place. Although other chemicals are involved, histamine is primarily responsible for causing the symptoms. Antihistamines are found in eyedrops, nasal sprays and, most commonly, oral tablets and syrup. Antihistamines help to relieve nasal allergy symptoms such as: Sneezing and an itchy, runny nose Eye itching, burning, tearing and redness Itchy skin, hives and eczema There are dozens of antihistamines; some are available over the counter, while others require a prescription. Patients respond to them in a wide variety of ways. Generally, the newer (second-generation) products work well and produce only minor side effects. Some people find that an antihistamine becomes less effective as the allergy season worsens or as their allergies change over time. If you find that an antihistamine is becoming less effective, tell your allergist, who may recommend a different type or strength of antihistamine. If you have excessive nasal dryness or thick nasal mucus, consult an allergist before taking antihistamines. Contact your allergist for advice if an antihistamine causes drowsiness or other side effects. Proper use:  Short-acting antihistamines can be taken every four to six hours, while timed-release antihistamines are taken every 12 to 24 hours. The short-acting antihistamines are often most helpful if taken 30 minutes before an anticipated exposure to an allergen (such as at a picnic during ragweed season). Timed-release antihistamines are better suited to long-term use for those who need daily medications. Proper use of these drugs is just as important as their selection. The most effective way to use them is before symptoms develop. A dose taken early can eliminate the need for many later doses to reduce established symptoms. Many times, a patient will say that he or she “took one, and it didn’t work.” If the patient had taken the antihistamine regularly for three to four days to build up blood levels of the medication, it might have been effective. Side effects:  Older (first-generation) antihistamines may cause drowsiness or performance impairment, which can lead to accidents and personal injury. Even when these medications are taken only at bedtime, they can still cause considerable impairment the following day, even in people who do not feel drowsy. For this reason, it is important that you do not drive a car or work with dangerous machinery when you take a potentially sedating antihistamine. Some of the newer antihistamines do not cause drowsiness. A frequent side effect is excessive dryness of the mouth, nose, and eyes. Less common side effects include restlessness, nervousness, overexcitability, insomnia, dizziness, headaches, euphoria, fainting, visual disturbances, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distress, constipation, diarrhea, increased or decreased urination, urinary retention, high or low blood pressure, nightmares (especially in children), sore throat, unusual bleeding or bruising, chest tightness or palpitations. Men with prostate enlargement may encounter urinary problems while on antihistamines. Consult your allergist if these reactions occur. Important precautions: Follow your allergist’s instructions. Alcohol and tranquilizers increase the sedation side effects of antihistamines. Do not use more than one antihistamine at a time, unless prescribed. Keep these medications out of the reach of children. Know how the medication affects you before working with heavy machinery, driving, or doing other performance-intensive tasks; some products can slow your reaction time. Some antihistamines appear to be safe to take during pregnancy, but there have not been enough studies to determine the absolute safety of antihistamines in pregnancy. Again, consult your allergist or your obstetrician if you are pregnant or considering getting pregnant. While antihistamines have been taken safely by millions of people in the last 50 years, don’t take antihistamines before telling your allergist if you are allergic to, or intolerant of, any medicine; are pregnant or intend to become pregnant while using this medication; are breast-feeding; have glaucoma or an enlarged prostate; or are ill. Never take anyone else’s medication. Decongestants Decongestants help relieve the stuffiness and pressure caused by swollen nasal tissue. They do not contain antihistamines, so they do not cause antihistaminic side effects. They do not relieve other symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Oral decongestants are available as prescription and nonprescription medications and are often found in combination with antihistamines or other medications. It is not uncommon for patients using decongestants to experience insomnia if they take the medication in the afternoon or evening. If this occurs, a dose reduction may be needed. At times, men with prostate enlargement may encounter urinary problems while on decongestants. Patients using medications to manage emotional or behavioral problems should discuss this with their allergist before using decongestants. Patients with high blood pressure or heart disease should check with their allergist before using. Pregnant patients should also check with their allergist before starting decongestants. Nonprescription decongestant nasal sprays work within minutes and last for hours, but you should not use them for more than a few days at a time unless instructed by your allergist. Prolonged use can cause rhinitis medicamentosa or rebound swelling of the nasal tissue, leading to more frequent congestion and need to re-dose medication more frequently than recommended. Stopping the use of the decongestant nasal spray will cure the swelling if there is no underlying disorder. Other nasal sprays Nonprescription saline nasal sprays will help counteract symptoms such as dry nasal passages or thick nasal mucus. Unlike decongestant nasal sprays, a saline nasal spray can be used as often as it is needed. Sometimes an allergist may recommend washing (douching) the nasal passage. There are many OTC delivery systems for saline rinses, including neti pots and saline rinse bottles. Nasal cromolyn (Nasalcrom) blocks the body’s release of allergy-causing substances. It does not work in all patients. The full dose is four times daily, and improvement of symptoms may take several weeks. Nasal cromolyn can help prevent allergic nasal reactions if taken prior to an allergen exposure. Nasal ipratropium bromide spray (Atrovent) can help reduce nasal drainage from allergic rhinitis or some forms of nonallergic rhinitis. Another prescription nasal spray option is an intranasal antihistamine. These medications, such as azelastine (Astelin) or olopatadine (Patanase), are older antihistamines with some allergy cell stabilizing properties that can be used alone or with other medications including oral antihistamines and intranasal steroids. One nice feature of these medications is that they work quickly enough that they can be used as needed rather than every day. They can also help relieve nasal congestion and post nasal drainage but can cause sedation in some patients. Azelastine in particular may have an unpleasant taste. Leukatriene pathway inhibitors Leukotriene pathway inhibitors (montelukast, zafirlukast and zileuton) block the action of leukotriene, a substance in the body that can cause symptoms of allergic rhinitis. These drugs are also used to treat asthma and are only available by prescription. Montelukast was recently given a warning from the FDA regarding potential behavioral changes. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy may be recommended for people who don’t respond well to treatment with medications or who experience side effects from medications, who have allergen exposure that is unavoidable or who desire a more permanent solution to their allergies. Immunotherapy can be very effective in controlling allergic symptoms, but it doesn’t help the symptoms produced by nonallergic rhinitis. Two types of immunotherapy are available: allergy shots and sublingual (under-the-tongue) tablets. Allergy shots:  A treatment program, which typically continues for three to five years, consists of  injections  of a diluted allergy extract, administered frequently in increasing doses until a maintenance dose is reached. Then the injection schedule is changed so that the same dose is given with longer intervals between injections. Immunotherapy helps the body build tolerance to the effects of the allergen, reduces the intensity of symptoms caused by allergen exposure and sometimes can make skin test reactions disappear. As tolerance develops over several months, symptoms should improve. Sublingual tablets:  This type of immunotherapy was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014. Starting several months before allergy season begins, patients dissolve a tablet under the tongue daily. Some patients benefit from year-round treatment. Treatment can continue for as long as three years. Only a few allergens (certain grass and ragweed pollens and house dust mite) can be treated now with this method, but it is a promising therapy for the future. Eye allergy preparations and eyedrops Eye allergy preparations may be helpful when the eyes are affected by the same allergens that trigger rhinitis, causing redness, swelling, watery eyes and itching. OTC eyedrops and oral medications are commonly used for short-term relief of some eye allergy symptoms. They may not relieve all symptoms, though, and prolonged use of some of these drops may cause your condition to worsen. Prescription eyedrops and oral medications also are used to treat eye allergies. Prescription eyedrops provide both short- and long-term targeted relief of eye allergy symptoms. Check with your allergist  or pharmacist if you are unsure about a specific drug or formula. Treatments that are not recommended for allergic rhinitis Antibiotics:  Effective for the treatment of bacterial infections, antibiotics do not affect the course of uncomplicated common colds (a viral infection) and are of no benefit for noninfectious rhinitis, including allergic rhinitis. Nasal surgery:  Surgery is not a treatment for allergic rhinitis, but it may help if patients have nasal polyps or chronic sinusitis that is not responsive to antibiotics or nasal steroid sprays. Occupational Rhinitis If you develop symptoms that resemble those of  hay fever  and that appear or become more serious at work, you may be suffering from occupational rhinitis. Occupational rhinitis, or work-related rhinitis, is a condition in which symptoms are triggered or further aggravated by allergens in the workplace. These symptoms can include sneezing, a runny nose and watering eyes. Common triggers include cleaning products, chemical fumes, certain types of dust, and corrosive gases. If your allergy symptoms appear at work, or seem to get worse there,  ask your allergist  to help you identify potential triggers and develop a treatment plan.\\nFAQs\\nWhat is allergic rhinitis?\\nAllergic rhinitis is an allergic reaction to airborne allergens, like seasonal grass or ragweed  pollen  or year-round allergens like  dust  and  animal dander . Allergic rhinitis is sometimes called “hay fever,” especially when caused by seasonal allergens. Hay fever shares many of the same symptoms as a common cold but is not caused by a virus or bacteria. Instead, it is caused by your immune system reacting to allergens you breath into your body.\\nWhat is hay fever?\\nHay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis, most commonly used to describe a seasonal allergic reaction to  pollen  such as ragweed. However, the term is often used to refer to nasal allergies caused by any inhaled allergen. Despite the name, hay fever is not necessarily a reaction to hay, and it does not cause a fever.\\nIs allergic rhinitis contagious?\\nNo. Allergic rhinitis (or hay fever) is caused by your immune system’s response to allergens breathed into your body. It is not caused by a virus or bacteria and is not contagious.\\nWhat are hay fever symptoms?\\nHay fever, or allergic rhinitis, symptoms are similar to the symptoms of a common cold. Some common symptoms include sneezing, congestion, coughing, sinus pressure, itchy watery eyes, and itchy nose, mouth, and throat, and fatigue. It can be difficult to tell the difference between a cold and hay fever. If you have hay fever, your runny nose will likely have a thin, watery discharge, and, despite the name, you will not have a fever. If you have a cold, you may have a thicker or yellowish discharge from your nose and may have a low-grade fever. Hay fever symptoms can begin immediately after you are exposed to allergens like  pollen  or  animal dander , and will continue as long as your exposure continues. A cold will most likely begin a day or two after exposure to the virus and can last a few days to a week.\\nThis page was reviewed for accuracy 6/17/2020.\\nFind an Allergist Near You\\nGet Relief.\\nFind an Allergist\\nFind what you’re looking for:\\nSearch for:\\nStay in the know with our quarterly newsletter:\\nEmail *\\nName This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\\nΔ\\nNeed an Allergist?

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

But don’t be misled by the name – you don’t have to be exposed to hay to have symptoms. And hay fever doesn’t cause a fever. Allergic rhinitis develops when the body’s immune system recognizes and overreacts to something in the environment that typically causes no problems in most people. Seasonal: Symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis can occur in spring, summer, and early fall. They are usually caused by allergic sensitivity to airborne mold spores or to pollens from trees, grass, and weeds. Perennial: People with perennial allergic rhinitis experience symptoms year-round. It is generally caused by dust mites, pet hair or dander, cockroaches, or mold. Underlying or hidden food allergies rarely cause perennial nasal symptoms.\\nDoes hay fever have you in its grip?\\nIt’s time for an allergist.\\nFind an Allergist\\nSome people may experience both types of rhinitis, with perennial symptoms getting worse during specific pollen seasons. There are also nonallergic causes for rhinitis including irritants such as cigarette or other smoke, perfumes, cleaning products and other strong odors. It’s time to take control of your allergic rhinitis and start enjoying life again. It’s time to find an allergist. Hay Fever Symptoms Runny nose Itchy eyes, mouth or skin Sneezing Stuffy nose due to blockage or congestion Fatigue (often reported due to poor quality sleep as a result of nasal obstruction) Hay Fever Triggers Outdoor allergens, such as pollens from trees, grass, weeds, and mold spores Indoor allergens, such as pet hair or dander, dust mites and mold Irritants, such as cigarette smoke, perfume, and diesel exhaust Hay Fever Management and Treatment Avoid triggers by making changes to your home and to your behavior. Keep windows closed during high pollen periods; use air conditioning in your home and car. Wear glasses or sunglasses when outdoors to keep pollen out of your eyes. Use “mite-proof” bedding covers to limit exposure to dust mites and a dehumidifier to control mold. (If you smell mildew, you likely have mold). Wash your hands after petting any animal, and have a nonallergic person help with pet grooming, preferably in a well-ventilated area or outside.\\nWhat people don’t realize is most of the over-the-counter medicines are designed for milder allergies. For the people who have more moderate to severe allergy problems, it’s very rare that over the counter medicines are enough. Allergist James Sublett, MD\\nSymptoms People with allergic rhinitis generally experience symptoms after breathing in an allergy-causing substance such as pollen or dust. In the spring, the most common triggers are tree and grass pollen. In the fall, a common allergen is  ragweed  or other weed pollens or outdoor mold. When a sensitive person inhales an allergen, the body’s immune system may react with the following symptoms (listed in order of frequency): Stuffy nose due to blockage or congestion Runny nose or post nasal drainage Itching, usually in the nose, mouth, eyes, or throat Red and watery eyes Puffy, swollen eyelids Sneezing Cough Symptoms also may be triggered by common irritants such as: Cigarette smoke Strong odors, such as perfume, or hair spray and fumes Cleaning solutions, pool chlorine, car exhaust and other air pollutants (i.e., ozone) Air fresheners There are two types of allergic rhinitis: Seasonal: Symptoms can occur in spring, summer, and early fall. They are usually caused by sensitivity to airborne mold spores or to pollens from trees, grasses, or weeds. Perennial: Symptoms occur year-round and are generally caused by sensitivity to  dust mites ,  pet hair  or dander,  cockroaches  or  mold . Allergic rhinitis can be associated with: Decreased concentration and focus Limited activities Decreased decision-making capacity Impaired hand-eye coordination Problems remembering things Irritability Sleep disorders Fatigue Missed days of work or school More motor vehicle accidents More school or work injuries Many parents of children with allergic rhinitis have said that their children are more moody and irritable during allergy season. Since children cannot always express their symptoms verbally, they may express their discomfort by acting up at school and at home. In addition, some children feel that having an allergy is a stigma that separates them from others. It is important that the irritability or other symptoms caused by allergy symptoms are not mistaken for attention deficit disorder. With proper  treatment , symptoms can be kept under control and disruptions in learning and behavior can be avoided. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis have other causes as well, the most customary being the common cold – an example of infectious rhinitis. Most infections are relatively short-lived, with symptoms improving in three to seven days. Many people have recurrent or chronic nasal congestion, excess mucus production, itching and other nasal symptoms similar to those of allergic rhinitis. In those cases, an allergy may not be the cause. Diagnosing Occasional allergies aren’t just something you have to live with. Consulting an  allergist  is the most effective way to diagnose and treat allergic rhinitis symptoms and help you find relief. Your allergist may start by taking a detailed history, looking for clues in your lifestyle that will help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. You’ll be asked, among other things, about your work and home environments (including whether you have a pet) your family’s medical history and the frequency and severity of your symptoms. Sometimes allergic rhinitis can be complicated by several medical conditions, such as a deviated septum (curvature of the bone and cartilage that separate the nostrils) or nasal polyps (abnormal growths inside the nose and sinuses). Any of these conditions will be made worse by catching a cold. Nasal symptoms caused by more than one problem can be difficult to treat, often requiring the cooperation of an allergist and another specialist, such as an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist surgeon). Your allergist may recommend a  skin test , in which small amounts of suspected allergens are introduced into your skin. Skin testing is the easiest, most sensitive, and generally least expensive way of identifying allergens. Types of skin tests Prick or scratch test: In this test, a tiny drop of a possible allergen is pricked or scratched into the skin. Also known as a percutaneous test, this is the most common type of skin test. The results are known within 10 to 20 minutes. Intradermal test: A small amount of a possible allergen is injected under the skin using a thin needle. The site is checked for a reaction after about 20 minutes. This test is typically more sensitive than the prick or scratch test. Management and Treatment Avoidance The first approach in managing seasonal or perennial forms of allergic rhinitis or hay fever should be to avoid the allergens that trigger symptoms, if possible. Outdoor exposure Stay indoors as much as possible when pollen counts are at their peak, usually during the midmorning and early evening (this may vary according to plant pollen), and when wind is  blowing pollens  around. Avoid using window fans that can draw pollens and molds into the house. Wear glasses or sunglasses when outdoors to minimize the amount of pollen getting into your eyes. Don’t hang clothing outdoors to dry; pollen may cling to towels and sheets. Try not to rub your eyes; doing so will irritate them and could make your symptoms worse. Indoor exposure Keep windows closed and use air conditioning in your car and home. Make sure to keep your air conditioning unit clean. Reduce exposure to dust mites, especially in the bedroom. Use “mite-proof” covers for pillows, comforters and duvets, and mattresses and box springs. Wash your bedding frequently, using hot water (at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit). To limit exposure to mold, keep the humidity in your home low (between 30 and 50 percent) and clean your bathrooms, kitchen, and basement regularly. Use a dehumidifier, especially in the basement and in other damp, humid places, and empty and clean it often. If mold is visible, clean it with mild detergent and a 5 percent bleach solution as directed by an allergist. Clean floors with a damp rag or mop, rather than dry-dusting or sweeping. Exposure to pets Wash your hands immediately after petting any animals; wash your clothes after visiting friends with pets. If you are allergic to a  household pet , keep your pet out of your home as much as possible. If the pet must be inside, keep it out of your bedroom so you are not exposed to pet allergens while you sleep. Close the air ducts to your bedroom if you have forced-air or central heating or cooling. Replace carpeting with hardwood, tile, or linoleum, all of which are easier to keep dander-free. Medications Many allergens that trigger allergic rhinitis are airborne, so you can’t always avoid them. If your symptoms can’t be well-controlled by simply avoiding triggers, your allergist may recommend medications that reduce nasal congestion, sneezing, and an itchy and runny nose. They are available in many forms – oral tablets, liquid medication, nasal sprays and eyedrops. Some medications may have side effects, so discuss these treatments with your allergist so they can help you live the life you want. Intranasal corticosteroids Intranasal corticosteroids are the single most effective drug class for treating allergic rhinitis. They can significantly reduce nasal congestion as well as sneezing, itching and a runny nose. Ask your allergist about whether these medications are appropriate and safe for you. These sprays are designed to avoid the side effects that may occur from steroids that are taken by mouth or injection. Take care not to spray the medication against the center portion of the nose (the nasal septum). The most common side effects are local irritation and nasal bleeding. Some older preparations have been shown to have some effect on children’s growth; data about some newer steroids don’t indicate an effect on growth. Antihistamines Antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergic rhinitis. These medications counter the effects of histamine , the irritating chemical released within your body when an allergic reaction takes place. Although other chemicals are involved, histamine is primarily responsible for causing the symptoms. Antihistamines are found in eyedrops, nasal sprays and, most commonly, oral tablets and syrup. Antihistamines help to relieve nasal allergy symptoms such as: Sneezing and an itchy, runny nose Eye itching, burning, tearing and redness Itchy skin, hives and eczema There are dozens of antihistamines; some are available over the counter, while others require a prescription. Patients respond to them in a wide variety of ways. Generally, the newer (second-generation) products work well and produce only minor side effects. Some people find that an antihistamine becomes less effective as the allergy season worsens or as their allergies change over time. If you find that an antihistamine is becoming less effective, tell your allergist, who may recommend a different type or strength of antihistamine. If you have excessive nasal dryness or thick nasal mucus, consult an allergist before taking antihistamines. Contact your allergist for advice if an antihistamine causes drowsiness or other side effects. Proper use:  Short-acting antihistamines can be taken every four to six hours, while timed-release antihistamines are taken every 12 to 24 hours. The short-acting antihistamines are often most helpful if taken 30 minutes before an anticipated exposure to an allergen (such as at a picnic during ragweed season). Timed-release antihistamines are better suited to long-term use for those who need daily medications. Proper use of these drugs is just as important as their selection. The most effective way to use them is before symptoms develop. A dose taken early can eliminate the need for many later doses to reduce established symptoms. Many times, a patient will say that he or she “took one, and it didn’t work.” If the patient had taken the antihistamine regularly for three to four days to build up blood levels of the medication, it might have been effective. Side effects:  Older (first-generation) antihistamines may cause drowsiness or performance impairment, which can lead to accidents and personal injury. Even when these medications are taken only at bedtime, they can still cause considerable impairment the following day, even in people who do not feel drowsy. For this reason, it is important that you do not drive a car or work with dangerous machinery when you take a potentially sedating antihistamine. Some of the newer antihistamines do not cause drowsiness. A frequent side effect is excessive dryness of the mouth, nose, and eyes. Less common side effects include restlessness, nervousness, overexcitability, insomnia, dizziness, headaches, euphoria, fainting, visual disturbances, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distress, constipation, diarrhea, increased or decreased urination, urinary retention, high or low blood pressure, nightmares (especially in children), sore throat, unusual bleeding or bruising, chest tightness or palpitations. Men with prostate enlargement may encounter urinary problems while on antihistamines. Consult your allergist if these reactions occur. Important precautions: Follow your allergist’s instructions. Alcohol and tranquilizers increase the sedation side effects of antihistamines. Do not use more than one antihistamine at a time, unless prescribed. Keep these medications out of the reach of children. Know how the medication affects you before working with heavy machinery, driving, or doing other performance-intensive tasks; some products can slow your reaction time. Some antihistamines appear to be safe to take during pregnancy, but there have not been enough studies to determine the absolute safety of antihistamines in pregnancy. Again, consult your allergist or your obstetrician if you are pregnant or considering getting pregnant. While antihistamines have been taken safely by millions of people in the last 50 years, don’t take antihistamines before telling your allergist if you are allergic to, or intolerant of, any medicine; are pregnant or intend to become pregnant while using this medication; are breast-feeding; have glaucoma or an enlarged prostate; or are ill. Never take anyone else’s medication. Decongestants Decongestants help relieve the stuffiness and pressure caused by swollen nasal tissue. They do not contain antihistamines, so they do not cause antihistaminic side effects. They do not relieve other symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Oral decongestants are available as prescription and nonprescription medications and are often found in combination with antihistamines or other medications. It is not uncommon for patients using decongestants to experience insomnia if they take the medication in the afternoon or evening. If this occurs, a dose reduction may be needed. At times, men with prostate enlargement may encounter urinary problems while on decongestants. Patients using medications to manage emotional or behavioral problems should discuss this with their allergist before using decongestants. Patients with high blood pressure or heart disease should check with their allergist before using. Pregnant patients should also check with their allergist before starting decongestants. Nonprescription decongestant nasal sprays work within minutes and last for hours, but you should not use them for more than a few days at a time unless instructed by your allergist. Prolonged use can cause rhinitis medicamentosa or rebound swelling of the nasal tissue, leading to more frequent congestion and need to re-dose medication more frequently than recommended. Stopping the use of the decongestant nasal spray will cure the swelling if there is no underlying disorder. Other nasal sprays Nonprescription saline nasal sprays will help counteract symptoms such as dry nasal passages or thick nasal mucus. Unlike decongestant nasal sprays, a saline nasal spray can be used as often as it is needed. Sometimes an allergist may recommend washing (douching) the nasal passage. There are many OTC delivery systems for saline rinses, including neti pots and saline rinse bottles. Nasal cromolyn (Nasalcrom) blocks the body’s release of allergy-causing substances. It does not work in all patients. The full dose is four times daily, and improvement of symptoms may take several weeks. Nasal cromolyn can help prevent allergic nasal reactions if taken prior to an allergen exposure. Nasal ipratropium bromide spray (Atrovent) can help reduce nasal drainage from allergic rhinitis or some forms of nonallergic rhinitis. Another prescription nasal spray option is an intranasal antihistamine. These medications, such as azelastine (Astelin) or olopatadine (Patanase), are older antihistamines with some allergy cell stabilizing properties that can be used alone or with other medications including oral antihistamines and intranasal steroids. One nice feature of these medications is that they work quickly enough that they can be used as needed rather than every day. They can also help relieve nasal congestion and post nasal drainage but can cause sedation in some patients. Azelastine in particular may have an unpleasant taste. Leukatriene pathway inhibitors Leukotriene pathway inhibitors (montelukast, zafirlukast and zileuton) block the action of leukotriene, a substance in the body that can cause symptoms of allergic rhinitis. These drugs are also used to treat asthma and are only available by prescription. Montelukast was recently given a warning from the FDA regarding potential behavioral changes. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy may be recommended for people who don’t respond well to treatment with medications or who experience side effects from medications, who have allergen exposure that is unavoidable or who desire a more permanent solution to their allergies. Immunotherapy can be very effective in controlling allergic symptoms, but it doesn’t help the symptoms produced by nonallergic rhinitis. Two types of immunotherapy are available: allergy shots and sublingual (under-the-tongue) tablets. Allergy shots:  A treatment program, which typically continues for three to five years, consists of  injections  of a diluted allergy extract, administered frequently in increasing doses until a maintenance dose is reached. Then the injection schedule is changed so that the same dose is given with longer intervals between injections. Immunotherapy helps the body build tolerance to the effects of the allergen, reduces the intensity of symptoms caused by allergen exposure and sometimes can make skin test reactions disappear. As tolerance develops over several months, symptoms should improve. Sublingual tablets:  This type of immunotherapy was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014. Starting several months before allergy season begins, patients dissolve a tablet under the tongue daily. Some patients benefit from year-round treatment. Treatment can continue for as long as three years. Only a few allergens (certain grass and ragweed pollens and house dust mite) can be treated now with this method, but it is a promising therapy for the future. Eye allergy preparations and eyedrops Eye allergy preparations may be helpful when the eyes are affected by the same allergens that trigger rhinitis, causing redness, swelling, watery eyes and itching. OTC eyedrops and oral medications are commonly used for short-term relief of some eye allergy symptoms. They may not relieve all symptoms, though, and prolonged use of some of these drops may cause your condition to worsen. Prescription eyedrops and oral medications also are used to treat eye allergies. Prescription eyedrops provide both short- and long-term targeted relief of eye allergy symptoms. Check with your allergist  or pharmacist if you are unsure about a specific drug or formula. Treatments that are not recommended for allergic rhinitis Antibiotics:  Effective for the treatment of bacterial infections, antibiotics do not affect the course of uncomplicated common colds (a viral infection) and are of no benefit for noninfectious rhinitis, including allergic rhinitis. Nasal surgery:  Surgery is not a treatment for allergic rhinitis, but it may help if patients have nasal polyps or chronic sinusitis that is not responsive to antibiotics or nasal steroid sprays. Occupational Rhinitis If you develop symptoms that resemble those of  hay fever  and that appear or become more serious at work, you may be suffering from occupational rhinitis. Occupational rhinitis, or work-related rhinitis, is a condition in which symptoms are triggered or further aggravated by allergens in the workplace. These symptoms can include sneezing, a runny nose and watering eyes. Common triggers include cleaning products, chemical fumes, certain types of dust, and corrosive gases. If your allergy symptoms appear at work, or seem to get worse there,  ask your allergist  to help you identify potential triggers and develop a treatment plan.\\nFAQs\\nWhat is allergic rhinitis?\\nAllergic rhinitis is an allergic reaction to airborne allergens, like seasonal grass or ragweed  pollen  or year-round allergens like  dust  and  animal dander . Allergic rhinitis is sometimes called “hay fever,” especially when caused by seasonal allergens. Hay fever shares many of the same symptoms as a common cold but is not caused by a virus or bacteria. Instead, it is caused by your immune system reacting to allergens you breath into your body.\\nWhat is hay fever?\\nHay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis, most commonly used to describe a seasonal allergic reaction to  pollen  such as ragweed. However, the term is often used to refer to nasal allergies caused by any inhaled allergen. Despite the name, hay fever is not necessarily a reaction to hay, and it does not cause a fever.\\nIs allergic rhinitis contagious?\\nNo. Allergic rhinitis (or hay fever) is caused by your immune system’s response to allergens breathed into your body. It is not caused by a virus or bacteria and is not contagious.\\nWhat are hay fever symptoms?\\nHay fever, or allergic rhinitis, symptoms are similar to the symptoms of a common cold. Some common symptoms include sneezing, congestion, coughing, sinus pressure, itchy watery eyes, and itchy nose, mouth, and throat, and fatigue. It can be difficult to tell the difference between a cold and hay fever. If you have hay fever, your runny nose will likely have a thin, watery discharge, and, despite the name, you will not have a fever. If you have a cold, you may have a thicker or yellowish discharge from your nose and may have a low-grade fever. Hay fever symptoms can begin immediately after you are exposed to allergens like  pollen  or  animal dander , and will continue as long as your exposure continues. A cold will most likely begin a day or two after exposure to the virus and can last a few days to a week.\\nThis page was reviewed for accuracy 6/17/2020.\\nFind an Allergist Near You\\nGet Relief.\\nFind an Allergist\\nFind what you’re looking for:\\nSearch for:\\nStay in the know with our quarterly newsletter:\\nEmail *\\nName This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\\nΔ\\nNeed an Allergist?

This condition is caused by the body’s immune system overreacting to airborne allergens such as pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n#### Symptoms\\nCommon symptoms of hay fever include:\\n- Sneezing\\n- Runny nose\\n- Nasal congestion\\n- Itchy eyes, throat, or nose\\n- Watery eyes\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue (which can often be due to poor sleep as a result of nasal obstructions)\\n\\nSymptoms can vary from person to person and may worsen during specific seasons or when exposed to specific allergens.\\n\\n#### Triggers\\nHay fever can arise from various allergens:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: Tree pollen (spring), grass pollen (summer), ragweed pollen (late summer and fall).\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, mold.\\n- **Irritants**: Cigarette smoke, strong odors (e.g., perfume), fumes from cleaning products, air pollutants.\\n\\n#### Causes\\nHay fever occurs when the immune system identifies a harmless substance as a threat and overreacts by producing immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies come into contact with the allergen, the body releases chemicals like histamine, leading to allergic symptoms.\\n\\n#### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of allergic rhinitis involves:\\n- Reviewing medical history and symptoms.\\n- Conducting allergy tests (skin prick tests or blood tests) to identify specific triggers.\\n- Sometimes evaluating for complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps that could exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\n#### Management and Treatment\\n1. **Avoiding Allergens**: The first line of defense is avoiding known triggers. This includes:\\n   - Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n   - Using air conditioning to filter allergens.\\n   - Wearing sunglasses outdoors to protect eyes from pollen.\\n   - Keeping pets out of sleeping areas.\\n\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Help relieve symptoms like sneezing and itching. These can be found in oral form or nasal sprays.\\n   - **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Highly effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n   - **Decongestants**: Help relieve nasal stuffiness but are usually short-term treatments.\\n   - **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block chemicals in the body that contribute to allergic reactions.\\n   - **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can help build tolerance to allergens over time.\\n\\n3. **Non-Medication Strategies**:\\n   - Nasal saline rinses to clear irritants.\\n   - Use of HEPA filters for air purification in homes.\\n   - Regular cleaning to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n#### Complications\\nIf left unmanaged, hay fever can lead to:\\n- Poor sleep quality and daytime fatigue.\\n- Increased risk of developing asthma or other allergic conditions.\\n- Sinusitis or ear infections in some individuals, especially children.\\n\\n#### When to See a Doctor\\nConsult an allergist if:\\n- Symptoms are severe and disrupt daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about associated conditions like asthma or recurrent infections.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nHay fever is a common and manageable condition.

This condition is caused by the body’s immune system overreacting to airborne allergens such as pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n#### Symptoms\\nCommon symptoms of hay fever include:\\n- Sneezing\\n- Runny nose\\n- Nasal congestion\\n- Itchy eyes, throat, or nose\\n- Watery eyes\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue (which can often be due to poor sleep as a result of nasal obstructions)\\n\\nSymptoms can vary from person to person and may worsen during specific seasons or when exposed to specific allergens.\\n\\n#### Triggers\\nHay fever can arise from various allergens:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: Tree pollen (spring), grass pollen (summer), ragweed pollen (late summer and fall).\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, mold.\\n- **Irritants**: Cigarette smoke, strong odors (e.g., perfume), fumes from cleaning products, air pollutants.\\n\\n#### Causes\\nHay fever occurs when the immune system identifies a harmless substance as a threat and overreacts by producing immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies come into contact with the allergen, the body releases chemicals like histamine, leading to allergic symptoms.\\n\\n#### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of allergic rhinitis involves:\\n- Reviewing medical history and symptoms.\\n- Conducting allergy tests (skin prick tests or blood tests) to identify specific triggers.\\n- Sometimes evaluating for complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps that could exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\n#### Management and Treatment\\n1. **Avoiding Allergens**: The first line of defense is avoiding known triggers. This includes:\\n   - Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n   - Using air conditioning to filter allergens.\\n   - Wearing sunglasses outdoors to protect eyes from pollen.\\n   - Keeping pets out of sleeping areas.\\n\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Help relieve symptoms like sneezing and itching. These can be found in oral form or nasal sprays.\\n   - **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Highly effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n   - **Decongestants**: Help relieve nasal stuffiness but are usually short-term treatments.\\n   - **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block chemicals in the body that contribute to allergic reactions.\\n   - **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can help build tolerance to allergens over time.\\n\\n3. **Non-Medication Strategies**:\\n   - Nasal saline rinses to clear irritants.\\n   - Use of HEPA filters for air purification in homes.\\n   - Regular cleaning to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n#### Complications\\nIf left unmanaged, hay fever can lead to:\\n- Poor sleep quality and daytime fatigue.\\n- Increased risk of developing asthma or other allergic conditions.\\n- Sinusitis or ear infections in some individuals, especially children.\\n\\n#### When to See a Doctor\\nConsult an allergist if:\\n- Symptoms are severe and disrupt daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about associated conditions like asthma or recurrent infections.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nHay fever is a common and manageable condition. Effective treatments are available that can alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Consulting with an allergist can be beneficial in developing a personalized management plan.\\n\\n**Sources**:\\n- Cleveland Clinic [Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever): Symptoms & Treatment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- Mayo Clinic [Hay fever - Symptoms and causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- ACAAI [Hay Fever (Rhinitis) | Symptoms & Treatment](https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/hay-fever/)\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

Continuing Education Activity Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an atopic disease presenting with symptoms of sneezing, nasal congestion, clear rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis. It is an IgE-mediated immune response that is against inhaled antigens in the immediate phase, with a subsequent leukotriene-mediated late phase. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of allergic rhinitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.\\nObjectives:\\nIdentify the abnormal immune response in the etiology of allergic rhinitis. Explain the epidemiology of allergic rhinitis. Describe the use of intranasal steroids, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and immunotherapy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.\\nAccess free multiple choice questions on this topic.\\nIntroduction Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an atopic disease characterized by symptoms of nasal congestion, clear rhinorrhea, sneezing, postnasal drip, and nasal pruritis. It affects one in six individuals and is associated with significant morbidity, loss of productivity, and healthcare costs. Historically,  AR was thought to be a disease process of the nasal airway alone. Still, the development of the unified airway theory has classified AR as a component of systemic allergic response, with other associated conditions, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis, sharing an underlying systemic pathology. [1]  AR can be classified as either seasonal (intermittent) or perennial (chronic), with approximately 20% of cases being seasonal, 40% perennial, and 40% with features of both. [2] In addition to nasal symptoms, patients with AR may also present with associated allergic conjunctivitis, non-productive cough, Eustachian tube dysfunction, and chronic sinusitis. Once diagnosed, AR is treatable with a variety of modalities, with intra-nasal glucocorticoids being the first-line therapy. [1] Etiology The allergic response is classified into early and late-phase reactions. In the early phase, allergic rhinitis is an immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated response against inhaled allergens that cause inflammation driven by type 2 helper (Th2) cells. [2]  The initial response occurs within five to 15 minutes of exposure to an antigen, resulting in the degranulation of host mast cells. This releases a variety of pre-formed and newly synthesized mediators, including histamine, which is one of the primary mediators of allergic rhinitis. Histamine induces sneezing via the trigeminal nerve and also plays a role in rhinorrhea by stimulating mucous glands. Other immune mediators, such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, are also implicated as they act on blood vessels to cause nasal congestion. Four to six hours after the initial response, an influx of cytokines, such as interleukins (IL)-4 and IL-13, from mast cells occurs, signifying the development of the late-phase response. These cytokines, in turn, facilitate the infiltration of eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, and basophils into the nasal mucosa and produce nasal edema with resultant congestion. [3] Non-IgE-mediated hyperresponsiveness can develop due to eosinophilic infiltration and nasal mucosal obliteration. The nasal mucosa now becomes hyperreactive to normal stimuli (such as tobacco smoke and cold air) and causes symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis. [4] There are data to suggest a genetic component to allergic rhinitis, but high-quality studies are generally lacking. Monozygotic twins show 45% to 60% concordance, and dizygotic twins have a concordance rate of approximately 25% in the development of AR. Specific regions on chromosomes 3 and 4 also correlate with allergic responses. [5] Epidemiology The prevalence of allergic rhinitis based on physician diagnosis is approximately 15%; however, the prevalence is estimated to be as high as 30% based on patients with nasal symptoms. AR is known to peak in the second to fourth decades of life and then gradually decline. [6]  The incidence of AR in the pediatric population is also quite high, making it one of the most common chronic pediatric disorders. According to data from the International Study for Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, 14.6% in the 13 to 14 year age group and 8.5% in the 6 to 7 year age group display symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis linked to allergic rhinitis. [7] Seasonal allergic rhinitis seems to be more common in the pediatric age group, whereas chronic rhinitis is more prevalent in adults. [8] A systematic review from 2018 estimated that 3.6% of adults had missed work, and 36% had impaired work performance due to allergic rhinitis. Economic evaluations have shown that indirect costs associated with lost work productivity account for the majority of the cost burden for AR. [9]   Risk factors for developing AR include a family history of atopy, male sex, a presence of allergen-specific IgE, a serum IgE greater than 100 IU/mL before age 6, and higher socioeconomic status. [5] Studies in young children have shown a higher risk of AR in those with an early introduction to foods or formula and/or heavy exposure to cigarette smoking in the first year of life. [2] Although many recent studies have evaluated the link between pollution and the development of AR, no significant correlation yet exists. Interestingly, there are several factors identified that may have a protective effect on the development of AR. The role of breastfeeding in the development of AR is often debated, but it is still recommended due to its many other known benefits and no associated harms. There is no evidence that pet avoidance in childhood prevents AR; however, it is hypothesized that early pet exposure may induce immune tolerance. There is a growing interest in the \\\"farm effect\\\" on the development of allergies, and a meta-analysis of 8 studies showed a 40% lower risk in subjects who had lived on a farm during their first year of life. [10] History and Physical Taking a thorough, detailed history is an essential part of the evaluation of AR, and questions should focus on the types of symptoms, the time, duration, and frequency of symptoms, suspected exposures, exacerbating/alleviating factors, and seasonality. [10]  Patients with intermittent or seasonal allergic rhinitis have symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes, while patients with chronic AR often complain of postnasal drip, chronic nasal congestion, and obstruction. [8]  These patients will often have a family history of allergic rhinitis or a personal history of asthma. Patients with intermittent rhinitis may report triggers such as pollens, animal dander, flooring/upholstery, mold, humidity, perfumes, and/or tobacco smoke. [11] On physical examination, clinicians may notice mouth breathing, frequent sniffling and/or throat clearing, transverse supra-tip nasal crease, and dark circles under the eyes (allergic shiners). Nasal supratip crease is more common in children. Anterior rhinoscopy typically reveals swelling of the nasal mucosa and thin, clear secretions. The inferior turbinates may take on a bluish hue, and cobblestoning of the nasal mucosa may be present. Whenever possible, an internal endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity should be conducted to assess for nasal polyps and structural abnormalities. Pneumatic otoscopy can be used to assess for eustachian tube dysfunction, which can be a common finding in patients with allergic rhinitis. Palpation of sinuses may elicit tenderness in patients with chronic symptoms. These patients should also undergo careful examination for signs of asthma or dermatitis and should be questioned regarding aspirin sensitivity. [11] Evaluation Allergic rhinitis is largely a clinical diagnosis made based on a thorough history and physical. A positive response to empiric treatment with a nasal glucocorticoid can support the diagnosis. A formal diagnosis is possible with either serum testing for allergen-specific IgE or allergy skin testing. [6] As stated by the American Academy of Otolaryngology guidelines, allergy testing should be reserved for patients who are unresponsive to empiric treatment or require the identification of a specific allergen to target therapy. [1]  Serum testing does not require trained technicians, and the patient does not need to stop taking antihistamines in advance. Intradermal allergy testing does require a trained professional to perform testing, but results are available immediately. In patients with seasonal symptoms, testing should be performed during the peak symptoms season in order to best identify specific triggers. [6]  Skin testing is known to have slightly superior sensitivity to serum testing and is more cost-effective. Contraindications to skin allergy testing include patients with uncontrolled or severe asthma, unstable cardiovascular disease, pregnancy, and/or concurrent beta-blocker therapy. H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab can interfere with allergy skin test response; therefore, cessation is advisable before testing. [10] Radiographic imaging is not routinely recommended for the diagnosis of AR and is primarily used to rule out other conditions, such as rhinosinusitis. [10] Treatment / Management Avoidance of triggers, especially in those with seasonal symptoms, is encouraged, although it is not always practical. Precautions can be taken to avoid dust mites, animal dander, and upholstery, though this can require significant lifestyle changes that may not be acceptable to the patient. If removing a pet from the home is not feasible, isolating the pet to a single room in the house may be an option to minimize dander exposure. It may take up to 20 weeks to eliminate cat dander from the home, even after removing the animal.  Allergen-impermeable bedding covers, washing sheets in hot water, and the use of a vacuum cleaner with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters may also lessen symptoms. [5]   Pharmacological options include antihistamines, intranasal steroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), and immunotherapy. Intranasal corticosteroid therapy can be as monotherapy or in combination with oral antihistamines in patients in patients with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms. Studies have shown intranasal corticosteroids are superior to antihistamines in effectively reducing nasal inflammation and improving mucosal pathology. Thus a topical intranasal steroid should be the first-line treatment for AR. [12]  Commonly available nasal sprays in the United States include beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, and triamcinolone acetonide. Proper administration of nasal spray is critical in achieving an optimal clinical response and avoiding side effects; therefore, patients should always receive counsel on the appropriate use of devices. They should be used regularly, as their peak effect may take multiple days to develop. The spray bottle's tip should be placed just inside the naris and aimed laterally towards the ipsilateral eye to minimize contact of the product with the nasal septum. The most common side effect reported is nasal irritation, followed by epistaxis, both of which can be prevented by spraying away from the nasal septum. [11]  Oral and injectable steroids have been shown to alleviate symptoms of AR but are not recommended for routine use due to their significant systemic side-effect profile. [10] First-generation antihistamines include diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine, whereas fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine, and cetirizine are examples of second-generation antihistamines. Both first- and second-generation antihistamines are effective at controlling symptoms of AR. Still, first-generation antihistamines can be quite sedating due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. These agents also act on muscarinic receptors, causing side effects of dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and/or tachycardia. Second-generation antihistamines have improved H1 selectivity, are less sedating, and have longer half-lives (12 to 24 hours) than those of the first-generation. Fexofenadine has no sedating effects, but loratadine and desloratadine may be sedating at higher doses. Cetirizine has the most potential for sedation of all second-generation antihistamines. There is no one agent recommended over others, as all have shown similar efficacy and safety profiles in terms of symptom relief. [5]  Intranasal antihistamines, such as azelastine, have a rapid onset and are more efficacious than oral antihistamines in relieving nasal symptoms. They are recommended as first or second-line therapies for AR and can be used in conjunction with topical nasal steroid sprays with a synergistic effect. [10] Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) such as montelukast and zafirlukast can be beneficial in patients with AR, but they are not as efficacious as intranasal corticosteroids. [13]  Their use is often in combination therapy with other agents for severe or refractory symptoms. For patients in whom avoidance measures and combination pharmacotherapy are not effective, allergen immunotherapy should be considered.  Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) are commonly used therapies. Weekly incremental doses are given for 6 to 8 months, followed by maintenance doses for 3 to 5 years. Typically, patients experience a prolonged, protective effect, and therapy can be ceased. [1] Oral decongestants such as pseudoephedrine are useful in relieving symptoms but are not recommended for extended daily use due to their side-effect profile. Intranasal decongestants such as xylometazoline are alpha-agonists that are delivered directly to nasal tissue to produce vasoconstriction. Prolonged use of intranasal decongestants has a risk of causing rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa) and, therefore, should not be used for more than a week. [10] Sodium cromoglycate (Cromolyn) effectively reduces sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis, so it is a reasonable option. Surgical treatment is reserved for patients with nasal polyposis, inferior turbinate hypertrophy causing intractable nasal obstruction, or chronic sinus disease refractory to medical treatment. [5]  Budesonide is the only FDA-approved agent for pregnant patients experiencing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. [1]  Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is beneficial in patients with AR, although the cost associated with therapy is a limiting factor in its use. [14]  Nasal saline can be another option in conjunction with other treatment modalities. Isotonic solutions are more beneficial in adults, whereas hypertonic solutions may be more effective in children. [10] Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for AR includes other forms of rhinitis that are not allergic. Children, particularly those under the age of 2 years, should also be assessed for congenital causes of nasal obstruction, such as choanal atresia and immunodeficiencies. [2] [6] [10] Vasomotor rhinitis - noninflammatory rhinitis that can be triggered by a change in temperature, odors, or humidity Infectious rhinitis - viral or bacterial infections, most commonly seen in the pediatric population Cerebrospinal fluid leak - clear rhinitis refractory to treatment Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) - infiltration of eosinophils in nasal tissue without allergic sensitization Chemical rhinitis - exposure to chemicals through occupation, household chemicals, sport/leisure exposure Rhinitis of pregnancy and hormonally-induced rhinitis Drug-induced rhinitis - e.g., NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, nasal decongestants, cocaine Autoimmune, granulomatous, and vasculitic rhinitis - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis, etc. Nasal polyposis Nasopharyngeal neoplasm Sickle cell anemia - in a young child presenting with nasal polyposis and well-controlled asthma, sweat chloride testing is the appropriate next step in management to rule out cystic fibrosis. Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials In studies comparing the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on topical antihistamines and oral antihistamines, intranasal steroids were proven to be more beneficial in relieving sneezing symptoms, rhinorrhea,  and nasal pruritis and blockage and are, therefore, recommended as first-line therapy for all patients with AR. [15]  There is great evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy for AR and allergic asthma, and it is the only disease-modifying intervention in allergic conditions. [16] Anti-H3 and H4 antihistamines are currently under study for use in AR, but no agents have received approval yet. Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved for patients with COPD, has been proven to be beneficial in AR in one small study, but further studies to confirm results are lacking. A new route of administration for immunotherapy is the injection of allergens directly into lymph nodes. It has been proven to induce a 10-fold higher allergen-specific IgG response that is demonstrated by improved efficacy and safety. Dapilumab, a fully-humanized monoclonal antibody, improved AR-related nasal symptoms in a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It works by inhibiting the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, which are both key drivers of immune diseases. Novel therapeutic approaches such as these are in development or clinical trials and look promising in the treatment of AR. [16] Prognosis The belief is that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis peaks in adolescence and gradually decreases with advancing age. In a longitudinal study, at the time of the 23-year follow-up, 54.9% of patients showed improvement in symptoms, with 41.6% of those being symptom-free. Patients who had an onset of symptoms at a younger age were more likely to show improvement. The severity of AR can vary over time and depends on various factors such as location and season. [17]  Approximately 50% of patients receiving grass allergy immunotherapy noted improvement in symptoms that continued 3 years after discontinuation of therapy. [18] Complications Chronic rhinosinusitis, although distinct from allergic rhinitis, can be a complication of AR. It is characterized by nasal inflammation with symptoms of nasal congestion or discharge, ongoing for longer than 3 months. Chronic rhinosinusitis may also demonstrate findings of nasal polyps (nasal polyposis), which form as a result of chronic inflammation of the paranasal sinus mucosa. Nasal polyps are typically benign and present bilaterally. Unilateral nasal polyps should raise concerns for malignancy. The incidence of nasal polyps in the general population is approximately 4% and is more common in males. Treatment options include topical steroids and saline irrigation. Surgical removal is reserved for patients who do not respond to medical therapy. [1] It is also known that sensitization to allergens in AR can alter the immunological parameters of the adenoids, resulting in adenoid hypertrophy. [4] Eustachian tube dysfunction commonly manifests in patients with AR and presents as ear fullness, otalgia, and ear-popping. Approximately 10 to 40% of patients with AR also have concurrent asthma, and some studies suggest asthma is more common in moderate to severe persistent rhinitis. Many studies have demonstrated AR to be an independent risk factor for asthma, especially in patients diagnosed with AR during infancy. Some other associated complications include otitis media with effusion, persistent cough, and eosinophilic esophagitis, although there is a need to define the link more clearly. [10]   Patients undergoing allergen desensitization (allergy shots) can experience an acute exacerbation of rhinitis or asthma, or, in a worst-case scenario, the patient could progress to anaphylaxis. Therefore, staff members in offices that provide this therapy should be well-versed in the diagnosis and management of such severe reactions and have the appropriate emergency medications (especially epinephrine) and airway management equipment immediately available. [19] [20] Consultations Allergic rhinitis is most often diagnosed and managed by primary care physicians/providers. However, patients who fail traditional therapies for AR are eligible for referral to a specialist, such as an allergist or an otolaryngologist (ENT) with an allergy focus. Patients who are deemed candidates for immunotherapy typically obtain a referral to allergists for therapy. Specific findings on the physical exam should also prompt a referral, such as multiple nasal polyps in a pediatric patient, which is highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Patients who present with bloody or unilateral nasal discharge (not basic epistaxis) should be urgently referred to an ENT to rule out malignancy. Any concern for cerebrospinal fluid leak causing rhinorrhea also warrants referral to an ENT specialist. [21] Deterrence and Patient Education Patients often underestimate the severity of this condition and fail to seek medical therapy. It is important to adequately control AR, especially due to the link between AR and asthma, with poor control of rhinitis predicting poor control of asthma. [22] Patient compliance with the treatment regimen is crucial for the alleviation of symptoms. Patients should receive educational materials with information about allergic rhinitis and its implications. Moreover, patient education on the proper administration of nasal sprays also plays an essential role in a patient's response to therapy. [23]  Patients should be advised to look down and squirt nasal spray just inside the nostril, aiming toward the outer walls on both sides. It should be stressed that the patient should not take a deep breath or sniff hard after spraying. [15]  Counseling patients on the avoidance of known allergens is a necessary but time-consuming task. [23] Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes According to the \\\"ecology of medical care\\\" model, only a minority of patients seek medical care for their symptoms, and most of these are managed by their primary care physician (PCP) and a nurse practitioner. Therefore, it is crucial to provide patients with information on self-management and when to contact their PCP. The involvement of community pharmacists and nurse practitioners can play a vital role in achieving these goals. However, patients who fail traditional therapies for AR are eligible for referral to a specialist, such as an allergist or an otolaryngologist (ENT) with an allergy focus. Patients who are deemed candidates for immunotherapy typically obtain a referral to allergists for therapy. Specific findings on the physical exam should also prompt a referral, such as multiple nasal polyps in a pediatric patient, which is highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Patients who present with bloody or unilateral nasal discharge (not basic epistaxis) should be urgently referred to an ENT to rule out malignancy. Any concern for cerebrospinal fluid leak causing rhinorrhea also warrants referral to an ENT specialist. [21] PCPs, nurse practitioners, and allergy specialists often work closely in co-managing patients with AR. The interprofessional team must work as a team to educate the patient and family. After an initial evaluation and a treatment plan is in place, the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, and physician must work together to assure the patient improves and, if not, receives additional evaluation. Access to healthcare and specialists varies globally, but when available, PCPs, pediatricians, allergists, and/or ENT specialists working with specialty-trained ENT nurses and clinicians will result in the best outcomes.

This condition is caused by the body’s immune system overreacting to airborne allergens such as pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n#### Symptoms\\nCommon symptoms of hay fever include:\\n- Sneezing\\n- Runny nose\\n- Nasal congestion\\n- Itchy eyes, throat, or nose\\n- Watery eyes\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue (which can often be due to poor sleep as a result of nasal obstructions)\\n\\nSymptoms can vary from person to person and may worsen during specific seasons or when exposed to specific allergens.\\n\\n#### Triggers\\nHay fever can arise from various allergens:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: Tree pollen (spring), grass pollen (summer), ragweed pollen (late summer and fall).\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, mold.\\n- **Irritants**: Cigarette smoke, strong odors (e.g., perfume), fumes from cleaning products, air pollutants.\\n\\n#### Causes\\nHay fever occurs when the immune system identifies a harmless substance as a threat and overreacts by producing immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies come into contact with the allergen, the body releases chemicals like histamine, leading to allergic symptoms.\\n\\n#### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of allergic rhinitis involves:\\n- Reviewing medical history and symptoms.\\n- Conducting allergy tests (skin prick tests or blood tests) to identify specific triggers.\\n- Sometimes evaluating for complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps that could exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\n#### Management and Treatment\\n1. **Avoiding Allergens**: The first line of defense is avoiding known triggers. This includes:\\n   - Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n   - Using air conditioning to filter allergens.\\n   - Wearing sunglasses outdoors to protect eyes from pollen.\\n   - Keeping pets out of sleeping areas.\\n\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Help relieve symptoms like sneezing and itching. These can be found in oral form or nasal sprays.\\n   - **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Highly effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n   - **Decongestants**: Help relieve nasal stuffiness but are usually short-term treatments.\\n   - **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block chemicals in the body that contribute to allergic reactions.\\n   - **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can help build tolerance to allergens over time.\\n\\n3. **Non-Medication Strategies**:\\n   - Nasal saline rinses to clear irritants.\\n   - Use of HEPA filters for air purification in homes.\\n   - Regular cleaning to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n#### Complications\\nIf left unmanaged, hay fever can lead to:\\n- Poor sleep quality and daytime fatigue.\\n- Increased risk of developing asthma or other allergic conditions.\\n- Sinusitis or ear infections in some individuals, especially children.\\n\\n#### When to See a Doctor\\nConsult an allergist if:\\n- Symptoms are severe and disrupt daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about associated conditions like asthma or recurrent infections.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nHay fever is a common and manageable condition. Effective treatments are available that can alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Consulting with an allergist can be beneficial in developing a personalized management plan.\\n\\n**Sources**:\\n- Cleveland Clinic [Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever): Symptoms & Treatment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- Mayo Clinic [Hay fever - Symptoms and causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- ACAAI [Hay Fever (Rhinitis) | Symptoms & Treatment](https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/hay-fever/)\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

It affects one in six individuals and is associated with significant morbidity, loss of productivity, and healthcare costs. Historically,  AR was thought to be a disease process of the nasal airway alone. Still, the development of the unified airway theory has classified AR as a component of systemic allergic response, with other associated conditions, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis, sharing an underlying systemic pathology. [1]  AR can be classified as either seasonal (intermittent) or perennial (chronic), with approximately 20% of cases being seasonal, 40% perennial, and 40% with features of both. [2] In addition to nasal symptoms, patients with AR may also present with associated allergic conjunctivitis, non-productive cough, Eustachian tube dysfunction, and chronic sinusitis. Once diagnosed, AR is treatable with a variety of modalities, with intra-nasal glucocorticoids being the first-line therapy. [1] Etiology The allergic response is classified into early and late-phase reactions. In the early phase, allergic rhinitis is an immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated response against inhaled allergens that cause inflammation driven by type 2 helper (Th2) cells. [2]  The initial response occurs within five to 15 minutes of exposure to an antigen, resulting in the degranulation of host mast cells. This releases a variety of pre-formed and newly synthesized mediators, including histamine, which is one of the primary mediators of allergic rhinitis. Histamine induces sneezing via the trigeminal nerve and also plays a role in rhinorrhea by stimulating mucous glands. Other immune mediators, such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, are also implicated as they act on blood vessels to cause nasal congestion. Four to six hours after the initial response, an influx of cytokines, such as interleukins (IL)-4 and IL-13, from mast cells occurs, signifying the development of the late-phase response. These cytokines, in turn, facilitate the infiltration of eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, and basophils into the nasal mucosa and produce nasal edema with resultant congestion. [3] Non-IgE-mediated hyperresponsiveness can develop due to eosinophilic infiltration and nasal mucosal obliteration. The nasal mucosa now becomes hyperreactive to normal stimuli (such as tobacco smoke and cold air) and causes symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis. [4] There are data to suggest a genetic component to allergic rhinitis, but high-quality studies are generally lacking. Monozygotic twins show 45% to 60% concordance, and dizygotic twins have a concordance rate of approximately 25% in the development of AR. Specific regions on chromosomes 3 and 4 also correlate with allergic responses. [5] Epidemiology The prevalence of allergic rhinitis based on physician diagnosis is approximately 15%; however, the prevalence is estimated to be as high as 30% based on patients with nasal symptoms. AR is known to peak in the second to fourth decades of life and then gradually decline. [6]  The incidence of AR in the pediatric population is also quite high, making it one of the most common chronic pediatric disorders. According to data from the International Study for Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, 14.6% in the 13 to 14 year age group and 8.5% in the 6 to 7 year age group display symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis linked to allergic rhinitis. [7] Seasonal allergic rhinitis seems to be more common in the pediatric age group, whereas chronic rhinitis is more prevalent in adults. [8] A systematic review from 2018 estimated that 3.6% of adults had missed work, and 36% had impaired work performance due to allergic rhinitis. Economic evaluations have shown that indirect costs associated with lost work productivity account for the majority of the cost burden for AR. [9]   Risk factors for developing AR include a family history of atopy, male sex, a presence of allergen-specific IgE, a serum IgE greater than 100 IU/mL before age 6, and higher socioeconomic status. [5] Studies in young children have shown a higher risk of AR in those with an early introduction to foods or formula and/or heavy exposure to cigarette smoking in the first year of life. [2] Although many recent studies have evaluated the link between pollution and the development of AR, no significant correlation yet exists. Interestingly, there are several factors identified that may have a protective effect on the development of AR. The role of breastfeeding in the development of AR is often debated, but it is still recommended due to its many other known benefits and no associated harms. There is no evidence that pet avoidance in childhood prevents AR; however, it is hypothesized that early pet exposure may induce immune tolerance. There is a growing interest in the \\\"farm effect\\\" on the development of allergies, and a meta-analysis of 8 studies showed a 40% lower risk in subjects who had lived on a farm during their first year of life. [10] History and Physical Taking a thorough, detailed history is an essential part of the evaluation of AR, and questions should focus on the types of symptoms, the time, duration, and frequency of symptoms, suspected exposures, exacerbating/alleviating factors, and seasonality. [10]  Patients with intermittent or seasonal allergic rhinitis have symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes, while patients with chronic AR often complain of postnasal drip, chronic nasal congestion, and obstruction. [8]  These patients will often have a family history of allergic rhinitis or a personal history of asthma. Patients with intermittent rhinitis may report triggers such as pollens, animal dander, flooring/upholstery, mold, humidity, perfumes, and/or tobacco smoke. [11] On physical examination, clinicians may notice mouth breathing, frequent sniffling and/or throat clearing, transverse supra-tip nasal crease, and dark circles under the eyes (allergic shiners). Nasal supratip crease is more common in children. Anterior rhinoscopy typically reveals swelling of the nasal mucosa and thin, clear secretions. The inferior turbinates may take on a bluish hue, and cobblestoning of the nasal mucosa may be present. Whenever possible, an internal endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity should be conducted to assess for nasal polyps and structural abnormalities. Pneumatic otoscopy can be used to assess for eustachian tube dysfunction, which can be a common finding in patients with allergic rhinitis. Palpation of sinuses may elicit tenderness in patients with chronic symptoms. These patients should also undergo careful examination for signs of asthma or dermatitis and should be questioned regarding aspirin sensitivity. [11] Evaluation Allergic rhinitis is largely a clinical diagnosis made based on a thorough history and physical. A positive response to empiric treatment with a nasal glucocorticoid can support the diagnosis. A formal diagnosis is possible with either serum testing for allergen-specific IgE or allergy skin testing. [6] As stated by the American Academy of Otolaryngology guidelines, allergy testing should be reserved for patients who are unresponsive to empiric treatment or require the identification of a specific allergen to target therapy. [1]  Serum testing does not require trained technicians, and the patient does not need to stop taking antihistamines in advance. Intradermal allergy testing does require a trained professional to perform testing, but results are available immediately. In patients with seasonal symptoms, testing should be performed during the peak symptoms season in order to best identify specific triggers. [6]  Skin testing is known to have slightly superior sensitivity to serum testing and is more cost-effective. Contraindications to skin allergy testing include patients with uncontrolled or severe asthma, unstable cardiovascular disease, pregnancy, and/or concurrent beta-blocker therapy. H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab can interfere with allergy skin test response; therefore, cessation is advisable before testing. [10] Radiographic imaging is not routinely recommended for the diagnosis of AR and is primarily used to rule out other conditions, such as rhinosinusitis. [10] Treatment / Management Avoidance of triggers, especially in those with seasonal symptoms, is encouraged, although it is not always practical. Precautions can be taken to avoid dust mites, animal dander, and upholstery, though this can require significant lifestyle changes that may not be acceptable to the patient. If removing a pet from the home is not feasible, isolating the pet to a single room in the house may be an option to minimize dander exposure. It may take up to 20 weeks to eliminate cat dander from the home, even after removing the animal.  Allergen-impermeable bedding covers, washing sheets in hot water, and the use of a vacuum cleaner with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters may also lessen symptoms. [5]   Pharmacological options include antihistamines, intranasal steroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), and immunotherapy. Intranasal corticosteroid therapy can be as monotherapy or in combination with oral antihistamines in patients in patients with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms. Studies have shown intranasal corticosteroids are superior to antihistamines in effectively reducing nasal inflammation and improving mucosal pathology. Thus a topical intranasal steroid should be the first-line treatment for AR. [12]  Commonly available nasal sprays in the United States include beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, and triamcinolone acetonide. Proper administration of nasal spray is critical in achieving an optimal clinical response and avoiding side effects; therefore, patients should always receive counsel on the appropriate use of devices. They should be used regularly, as their peak effect may take multiple days to develop. The spray bottle's tip should be placed just inside the naris and aimed laterally towards the ipsilateral eye to minimize contact of the product with the nasal septum. The most common side effect reported is nasal irritation, followed by epistaxis, both of which can be prevented by spraying away from the nasal septum. [11]  Oral and injectable steroids have been shown to alleviate symptoms of AR but are not recommended for routine use due to their significant systemic side-effect profile. [10] First-generation antihistamines include diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine, whereas fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine, and cetirizine are examples of second-generation antihistamines. Both first- and second-generation antihistamines are effective at controlling symptoms of AR. Still, first-generation antihistamines can be quite sedating due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. These agents also act on muscarinic receptors, causing side effects of dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and/or tachycardia. Second-generation antihistamines have improved H1 selectivity, are less sedating, and have longer half-lives (12 to 24 hours) than those of the first-generation. Fexofenadine has no sedating effects, but loratadine and desloratadine may be sedating at higher doses. Cetirizine has the most potential for sedation of all second-generation antihistamines. There is no one agent recommended over others, as all have shown similar efficacy and safety profiles in terms of symptom relief. [5]  Intranasal antihistamines, such as azelastine, have a rapid onset and are more efficacious than oral antihistamines in relieving nasal symptoms. They are recommended as first or second-line therapies for AR and can be used in conjunction with topical nasal steroid sprays with a synergistic effect. [10] Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) such as montelukast and zafirlukast can be beneficial in patients with AR, but they are not as efficacious as intranasal corticosteroids. [13]  Their use is often in combination therapy with other agents for severe or refractory symptoms. For patients in whom avoidance measures and combination pharmacotherapy are not effective, allergen immunotherapy should be considered.  Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) are commonly used therapies. Weekly incremental doses are given for 6 to 8 months, followed by maintenance doses for 3 to 5 years. Typically, patients experience a prolonged, protective effect, and therapy can be ceased. [1] Oral decongestants such as pseudoephedrine are useful in relieving symptoms but are not recommended for extended daily use due to their side-effect profile. Intranasal decongestants such as xylometazoline are alpha-agonists that are delivered directly to nasal tissue to produce vasoconstriction. Prolonged use of intranasal decongestants has a risk of causing rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa) and, therefore, should not be used for more than a week. [10] Sodium cromoglycate (Cromolyn) effectively reduces sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis, so it is a reasonable option. Surgical treatment is reserved for patients with nasal polyposis, inferior turbinate hypertrophy causing intractable nasal obstruction, or chronic sinus disease refractory to medical treatment. [5]  Budesonide is the only FDA-approved agent for pregnant patients experiencing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. [1]  Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is beneficial in patients with AR, although the cost associated with therapy is a limiting factor in its use. [14]  Nasal saline can be another option in conjunction with other treatment modalities. Isotonic solutions are more beneficial in adults, whereas hypertonic solutions may be more effective in children. [10] Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for AR includes other forms of rhinitis that are not allergic. Children, particularly those under the age of 2 years, should also be assessed for congenital causes of nasal obstruction, such as choanal atresia and immunodeficiencies. [2] [6] [10] Vasomotor rhinitis - noninflammatory rhinitis that can be triggered by a change in temperature, odors, or humidity Infectious rhinitis - viral or bacterial infections, most commonly seen in the pediatric population Cerebrospinal fluid leak - clear rhinitis refractory to treatment Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) - infiltration of eosinophils in nasal tissue without allergic sensitization Chemical rhinitis - exposure to chemicals through occupation, household chemicals, sport/leisure exposure Rhinitis of pregnancy and hormonally-induced rhinitis Drug-induced rhinitis - e.g., NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, nasal decongestants, cocaine Autoimmune, granulomatous, and vasculitic rhinitis - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis, etc. Nasal polyposis Nasopharyngeal neoplasm Sickle cell anemia - in a young child presenting with nasal polyposis and well-controlled asthma, sweat chloride testing is the appropriate next step in management to rule out cystic fibrosis. Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials In studies comparing the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on topical antihistamines and oral antihistamines, intranasal steroids were proven to be more beneficial in relieving sneezing symptoms, rhinorrhea,  and nasal pruritis and blockage and are, therefore, recommended as first-line therapy for all patients with AR. [15]  There is great evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy for AR and allergic asthma, and it is the only disease-modifying intervention in allergic conditions. [16] Anti-H3 and H4 antihistamines are currently under study for use in AR, but no agents have received approval yet. Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved for patients with COPD, has been proven to be beneficial in AR in one small study, but further studies to confirm results are lacking. A new route of administration for immunotherapy is the injection of allergens directly into lymph nodes. It has been proven to induce a 10-fold higher allergen-specific IgG response that is demonstrated by improved efficacy and safety. Dapilumab, a fully-humanized monoclonal antibody, improved AR-related nasal symptoms in a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It works by inhibiting the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, which are both key drivers of immune diseases. Novel therapeutic approaches such as these are in development or clinical trials and look promising in the treatment of AR. [16] Prognosis The belief is that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis peaks in adolescence and gradually decreases with advancing age. In a longitudinal study, at the time of the 23-year follow-up, 54.9% of patients showed improvement in symptoms, with 41.6% of those being symptom-free. Patients who had an onset of symptoms at a younger age were more likely to show improvement. The severity of AR can vary over time and depends on various factors such as location and season. [17]  Approximately 50% of patients receiving grass allergy immunotherapy noted improvement in symptoms that continued 3 years after discontinuation of therapy. [18] Complications Chronic rhinosinusitis, although distinct from allergic rhinitis, can be a complication of AR. It is characterized by nasal inflammation with symptoms of nasal congestion or discharge, ongoing for longer than 3 months. Chronic rhinosinusitis may also demonstrate findings of nasal polyps (nasal polyposis), which form as a result of chronic inflammation of the paranasal sinus mucosa. Nasal polyps are typically benign and present bilaterally. Unilateral nasal polyps should raise concerns for malignancy. The incidence of nasal polyps in the general population is approximately 4% and is more common in males. Treatment options include topical steroids and saline irrigation. Surgical removal is reserved for patients who do not respond to medical therapy. [1] It is also known that sensitization to allergens in AR can alter the immunological parameters of the adenoids, resulting in adenoid hypertrophy. [4] Eustachian tube dysfunction commonly manifests in patients with AR and presents as ear fullness, otalgia, and ear-popping. Approximately 10 to 40% of patients with AR also have concurrent asthma, and some studies suggest asthma is more common in moderate to severe persistent rhinitis. Many studies have demonstrated AR to be an independent risk factor for asthma, especially in patients diagnosed with AR during infancy. Some other associated complications include otitis media with effusion, persistent cough, and eosinophilic esophagitis, although there is a need to define the link more clearly. [10]   Patients undergoing allergen desensitization (allergy shots) can experience an acute exacerbation of rhinitis or asthma, or, in a worst-case scenario, the patient could progress to anaphylaxis. Therefore, staff members in offices that provide this therapy should be well-versed in the diagnosis and management of such severe reactions and have the appropriate emergency medications (especially epinephrine) and airway management equipment immediately available. [19] [20] Consultations Allergic rhinitis is most often diagnosed and managed by primary care physicians/providers. However, patients who fail traditional therapies for AR are eligible for referral to a specialist, such as an allergist or an otolaryngologist (ENT) with an allergy focus. Patients who are deemed candidates for immunotherapy typically obtain a referral to allergists for therapy. Specific findings on the physical exam should also prompt a referral, such as multiple nasal polyps in a pediatric patient, which is highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Patients who present with bloody or unilateral nasal discharge (not basic epistaxis) should be urgently referred to an ENT to rule out malignancy. Any concern for cerebrospinal fluid leak causing rhinorrhea also warrants referral to an ENT specialist. [21] Deterrence and Patient Education Patients often underestimate the severity of this condition and fail to seek medical therapy. It is important to adequately control AR, especially due to the link between AR and asthma, with poor control of rhinitis predicting poor control of asthma. [22] Patient compliance with the treatment regimen is crucial for the alleviation of symptoms. Patients should receive educational materials with information about allergic rhinitis and its implications. Moreover, patient education on the proper administration of nasal sprays also plays an essential role in a patient's response to therapy. [23]  Patients should be advised to look down and squirt nasal spray just inside the nostril, aiming toward the outer walls on both sides. It should be stressed that the patient should not take a deep breath or sniff hard after spraying. [15]  Counseling patients on the avoidance of known allergens is a necessary but time-consuming task. [23] Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes According to the \\\"ecology of medical care\\\" model, only a minority of patients seek medical care for their symptoms, and most of these are managed by their primary care physician (PCP) and a nurse practitioner. Therefore, it is crucial to provide patients with information on self-management and when to contact their PCP. The involvement of community pharmacists and nurse practitioners can play a vital role in achieving these goals. However, patients who fail traditional therapies for AR are eligible for referral to a specialist, such as an allergist or an otolaryngologist (ENT) with an allergy focus. Patients who are deemed candidates for immunotherapy typically obtain a referral to allergists for therapy. Specific findings on the physical exam should also prompt a referral, such as multiple nasal polyps in a pediatric patient, which is highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Patients who present with bloody or unilateral nasal discharge (not basic epistaxis) should be urgently referred to an ENT to rule out malignancy. Any concern for cerebrospinal fluid leak causing rhinorrhea also warrants referral to an ENT specialist. [21] PCPs, nurse practitioners, and allergy specialists often work closely in co-managing patients with AR. The interprofessional team must work as a team to educate the patient and family. After an initial evaluation and a treatment plan is in place, the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, and physician must work together to assure the patient improves and, if not, receives additional evaluation. Access to healthcare and specialists varies globally, but when available, PCPs, pediatricians, allergists, and/or ENT specialists working with specialty-trained ENT nurses and clinicians will result in the best outcomes.

These symptoms resemble those of the common cold but are triggered by allergens instead of a viral infection. The underlying mechanism involves an exaggerated response of the immune system to airborne allergens like pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites. The immune system mistakenly identifies these harmless substances as threats, initiating an inflammatory response.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can greatly vary among individuals and may be more pronounced during specific seasons or when exposure to specific allergens occurs. Common symptoms include:\\n- **Sneezing:** A reflex to expel irritants from the nasal cavity.\\n- **Runny Nose:** Excess production of mucus in response to allergens.\\n- **Nasal Congestion:** Swelling in the nasal passages leading to difficulty breathing through the nose.\\n- **Itchy Eyes/Nose/Throat:** Caused by histamine release, leading to irritation.\\n- **Watery Eyes:** The body’s reflex response to irritation or inflammation.\\n- **Postnasal Drip:** Mucus dripping down the back of the throat, causing irritation.\\n- **Fatigue:** Often resulted from continuous nasal blockage affecting sleep quality.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever is triggered by a variety of allergens, which can be categorized as:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens:** Including tree pollen in spring, grass pollen in summer, and ragweed pollen in late summer and fall.\\n- **Perennial Allergens:** Such as dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, and molds, which can cause symptoms year-round.\\n- **Irritants:** Non-allergenic substances like cigarette smoke, strong odors (e.g., perfumes), fumes from cleaning products, and air pollutants can exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\n## Causes\\nThe primary cause of hay fever is an autoimmune response where the immune system mistakenly identifies harmless allergens as threats. Upon exposure, the body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies which bind to these allergens. The subsequent release of histamine and other chemicals leads to the common symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Factors contributing to this exaggerated immune reaction include genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, and lifestyle factors.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is made through:\\n- **Medical History Review:** Evaluating symptoms, their duration, and potential allergens.\\n- **Allergy Testing:** Skin prick tests or blood tests to pinpoint specific allergens.\\n- **Assessment for Complications:** Checking for associated conditions like asthma and nasal polyps that may complicate the management of hay fever.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\nEffective management of hay fever typically involves several strategies:\\n1. **Avoidance of Allergens:** Key first steps include:\\n   - Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n   - Utilizing air conditioning with proper filtration.\\n   - Wearing sunglasses outdoors for eye protection against pollen.\\n   - Maintaining cleaning practices that minimize dust mite development.\\n\\n2. **Medications:**\\n   - **Antihistamines:** Available as oral medications or nasal sprays to relieve symptoms.\\n   - **Intranasal Corticosteroids:** Effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n   - **Decongestants:** Provide short-term relief from nasal stuffiness but are not intended for prolonged use.\\n   - **Leukotriene Inhibitors:** Block chemical signals that contribute to allergy symptoms.\\n   - **Immunotherapy:** Through allergy shots or sublingual tablets, desensitization to specific allergens can be achieved.\\n\\n3. **Non-Medication Strategies:**\\n   - Nasal saline rinses help wash away irritants.\\n   - HEPA filters in home environments can drastically reduce indoor allergens.\\n   - Regular cleaning to eliminate dust and mold promotes a healthier living space.\\n\\n## Complications\\nIf left unmanaged, hay fever may lead to various complications such as:\\n- **Poor Sleep Quality:** Resulting from nasal obstruction leading to fatigue.\\n- **Asthma Development:** Increased risk of asthma and other allergic diseases.\\n- **Sinusitis or Ear Infections:** Especially common in children, linked to chronic nasal symptoms.\\n\\n## When to See a Doctor\\nConsultation with an allergist is recommended if:\\n- Symptoms significantly disrupt daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications do not provide relief.\\n- There are concerns regarding co-existing conditions like asthma or frequent infections.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nIn summary, hay fever is a prevalent condition characterized by allergic symptoms that significantly impact quality of life. However, effective management strategies, including avoidance of allergens, appropriate medication, and immunotherapy, are available to control symptoms.

This condition is caused by the body’s immune system overreacting to airborne allergens such as pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n#### Symptoms\\nCommon symptoms of hay fever include:\\n- Sneezing\\n- Runny nose\\n- Nasal congestion\\n- Itchy eyes, throat, or nose\\n- Watery eyes\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue (which can often be due to poor sleep as a result of nasal obstructions)\\n\\nSymptoms can vary from person to person and may worsen during specific seasons or when exposed to specific allergens.\\n\\n#### Triggers\\nHay fever can arise from various allergens:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: Tree pollen (spring), grass pollen (summer), ragweed pollen (late summer and fall).\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, mold.\\n- **Irritants**: Cigarette smoke, strong odors (e.g., perfume), fumes from cleaning products, air pollutants.\\n\\n#### Causes\\nHay fever occurs when the immune system identifies a harmless substance as a threat and overreacts by producing immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies come into contact with the allergen, the body releases chemicals like histamine, leading to allergic symptoms.\\n\\n#### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of allergic rhinitis involves:\\n- Reviewing medical history and symptoms.\\n- Conducting allergy tests (skin prick tests or blood tests) to identify specific triggers.\\n- Sometimes evaluating for complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps that could exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\n#### Management and Treatment\\n1. **Avoiding Allergens**: The first line of defense is avoiding known triggers. This includes:\\n   - Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n   - Using air conditioning to filter allergens.\\n   - Wearing sunglasses outdoors to protect eyes from pollen.\\n   - Keeping pets out of sleeping areas.\\n\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Help relieve symptoms like sneezing and itching. These can be found in oral form or nasal sprays.\\n   - **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Highly effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n   - **Decongestants**: Help relieve nasal stuffiness but are usually short-term treatments.\\n   - **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block chemicals in the body that contribute to allergic reactions.\\n   - **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can help build tolerance to allergens over time.\\n\\n3. **Non-Medication Strategies**:\\n   - Nasal saline rinses to clear irritants.\\n   - Use of HEPA filters for air purification in homes.\\n   - Regular cleaning to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n#### Complications\\nIf left unmanaged, hay fever can lead to:\\n- Poor sleep quality and daytime fatigue.\\n- Increased risk of developing asthma or other allergic conditions.\\n- Sinusitis or ear infections in some individuals, especially children.\\n\\n#### When to See a Doctor\\nConsult an allergist if:\\n- Symptoms are severe and disrupt daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about associated conditions like asthma or recurrent infections.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nHay fever is a common and manageable condition. Effective treatments are available that can alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Consulting with an allergist can be beneficial in developing a personalized management plan.\\n\\n**Sources**:\\n- Cleveland Clinic [Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever): Symptoms & Treatment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- Mayo Clinic [Hay fever - Symptoms and causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- ACAAI [Hay Fever (Rhinitis) | Symptoms & Treatment](https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/hay-fever/)\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

It affects one in six individuals and is associated with significant morbidity, loss of productivity, and healthcare costs. Historically,  AR was thought to be a disease process of the nasal airway alone. Still, the development of the unified airway theory has classified AR as a component of systemic allergic response, with other associated conditions, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis, sharing an underlying systemic pathology. [1]  AR can be classified as either seasonal (intermittent) or perennial (chronic), with approximately 20% of cases being seasonal, 40% perennial, and 40% with features of both. [2] In addition to nasal symptoms, patients with AR may also present with associated allergic conjunctivitis, non-productive cough, Eustachian tube dysfunction, and chronic sinusitis. Once diagnosed, AR is treatable with a variety of modalities, with intra-nasal glucocorticoids being the first-line therapy. [1] Etiology The allergic response is classified into early and late-phase reactions. In the early phase, allergic rhinitis is an immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated response against inhaled allergens that cause inflammation driven by type 2 helper (Th2) cells. [2]  The initial response occurs within five to 15 minutes of exposure to an antigen, resulting in the degranulation of host mast cells. This releases a variety of pre-formed and newly synthesized mediators, including histamine, which is one of the primary mediators of allergic rhinitis. Histamine induces sneezing via the trigeminal nerve and also plays a role in rhinorrhea by stimulating mucous glands. Other immune mediators, such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, are also implicated as they act on blood vessels to cause nasal congestion. Four to six hours after the initial response, an influx of cytokines, such as interleukins (IL)-4 and IL-13, from mast cells occurs, signifying the development of the late-phase response. These cytokines, in turn, facilitate the infiltration of eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, and basophils into the nasal mucosa and produce nasal edema with resultant congestion. [3] Non-IgE-mediated hyperresponsiveness can develop due to eosinophilic infiltration and nasal mucosal obliteration. The nasal mucosa now becomes hyperreactive to normal stimuli (such as tobacco smoke and cold air) and causes symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis. [4] There are data to suggest a genetic component to allergic rhinitis, but high-quality studies are generally lacking. Monozygotic twins show 45% to 60% concordance, and dizygotic twins have a concordance rate of approximately 25% in the development of AR. Specific regions on chromosomes 3 and 4 also correlate with allergic responses. [5] Epidemiology The prevalence of allergic rhinitis based on physician diagnosis is approximately 15%; however, the prevalence is estimated to be as high as 30% based on patients with nasal symptoms. AR is known to peak in the second to fourth decades of life and then gradually decline. [6]  The incidence of AR in the pediatric population is also quite high, making it one of the most common chronic pediatric disorders. According to data from the International Study for Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, 14.6% in the 13 to 14 year age group and 8.5% in the 6 to 7 year age group display symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis linked to allergic rhinitis. [7] Seasonal allergic rhinitis seems to be more common in the pediatric age group, whereas chronic rhinitis is more prevalent in adults. [8] A systematic review from 2018 estimated that 3.6% of adults had missed work, and 36% had impaired work performance due to allergic rhinitis. Economic evaluations have shown that indirect costs associated with lost work productivity account for the majority of the cost burden for AR. [9]   Risk factors for developing AR include a family history of atopy, male sex, a presence of allergen-specific IgE, a serum IgE greater than 100 IU/mL before age 6, and higher socioeconomic status. [5] Studies in young children have shown a higher risk of AR in those with an early introduction to foods or formula and/or heavy exposure to cigarette smoking in the first year of life. [2] Although many recent studies have evaluated the link between pollution and the development of AR, no significant correlation yet exists. Interestingly, there are several factors identified that may have a protective effect on the development of AR. The role of breastfeeding in the development of AR is often debated, but it is still recommended due to its many other known benefits and no associated harms. There is no evidence that pet avoidance in childhood prevents AR; however, it is hypothesized that early pet exposure may induce immune tolerance. There is a growing interest in the \\\"farm effect\\\" on the development of allergies, and a meta-analysis of 8 studies showed a 40% lower risk in subjects who had lived on a farm during their first year of life. [10] History and Physical Taking a thorough, detailed history is an essential part of the evaluation of AR, and questions should focus on the types of symptoms, the time, duration, and frequency of symptoms, suspected exposures, exacerbating/alleviating factors, and seasonality. [10]  Patients with intermittent or seasonal allergic rhinitis have symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes, while patients with chronic AR often complain of postnasal drip, chronic nasal congestion, and obstruction. [8]  These patients will often have a family history of allergic rhinitis or a personal history of asthma. Patients with intermittent rhinitis may report triggers such as pollens, animal dander, flooring/upholstery, mold, humidity, perfumes, and/or tobacco smoke. [11] On physical examination, clinicians may notice mouth breathing, frequent sniffling and/or throat clearing, transverse supra-tip nasal crease, and dark circles under the eyes (allergic shiners). Nasal supratip crease is more common in children. Anterior rhinoscopy typically reveals swelling of the nasal mucosa and thin, clear secretions. The inferior turbinates may take on a bluish hue, and cobblestoning of the nasal mucosa may be present. Whenever possible, an internal endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity should be conducted to assess for nasal polyps and structural abnormalities. Pneumatic otoscopy can be used to assess for eustachian tube dysfunction, which can be a common finding in patients with allergic rhinitis. Palpation of sinuses may elicit tenderness in patients with chronic symptoms. These patients should also undergo careful examination for signs of asthma or dermatitis and should be questioned regarding aspirin sensitivity. [11] Evaluation Allergic rhinitis is largely a clinical diagnosis made based on a thorough history and physical. A positive response to empiric treatment with a nasal glucocorticoid can support the diagnosis. A formal diagnosis is possible with either serum testing for allergen-specific IgE or allergy skin testing. [6] As stated by the American Academy of Otolaryngology guidelines, allergy testing should be reserved for patients who are unresponsive to empiric treatment or require the identification of a specific allergen to target therapy. [1]  Serum testing does not require trained technicians, and the patient does not need to stop taking antihistamines in advance. Intradermal allergy testing does require a trained professional to perform testing, but results are available immediately. In patients with seasonal symptoms, testing should be performed during the peak symptoms season in order to best identify specific triggers. [6]  Skin testing is known to have slightly superior sensitivity to serum testing and is more cost-effective. Contraindications to skin allergy testing include patients with uncontrolled or severe asthma, unstable cardiovascular disease, pregnancy, and/or concurrent beta-blocker therapy. H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab can interfere with allergy skin test response; therefore, cessation is advisable before testing. [10] Radiographic imaging is not routinely recommended for the diagnosis of AR and is primarily used to rule out other conditions, such as rhinosinusitis. [10] Treatment / Management Avoidance of triggers, especially in those with seasonal symptoms, is encouraged, although it is not always practical. Precautions can be taken to avoid dust mites, animal dander, and upholstery, though this can require significant lifestyle changes that may not be acceptable to the patient. If removing a pet from the home is not feasible, isolating the pet to a single room in the house may be an option to minimize dander exposure. It may take up to 20 weeks to eliminate cat dander from the home, even after removing the animal.  Allergen-impermeable bedding covers, washing sheets in hot water, and the use of a vacuum cleaner with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters may also lessen symptoms. [5]   Pharmacological options include antihistamines, intranasal steroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), and immunotherapy. Intranasal corticosteroid therapy can be as monotherapy or in combination with oral antihistamines in patients in patients with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms. Studies have shown intranasal corticosteroids are superior to antihistamines in effectively reducing nasal inflammation and improving mucosal pathology. Thus a topical intranasal steroid should be the first-line treatment for AR. [12]  Commonly available nasal sprays in the United States include beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, and triamcinolone acetonide. Proper administration of nasal spray is critical in achieving an optimal clinical response and avoiding side effects; therefore, patients should always receive counsel on the appropriate use of devices. They should be used regularly, as their peak effect may take multiple days to develop. The spray bottle's tip should be placed just inside the naris and aimed laterally towards the ipsilateral eye to minimize contact of the product with the nasal septum. The most common side effect reported is nasal irritation, followed by epistaxis, both of which can be prevented by spraying away from the nasal septum. [11]  Oral and injectable steroids have been shown to alleviate symptoms of AR but are not recommended for routine use due to their significant systemic side-effect profile. [10] First-generation antihistamines include diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine, whereas fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine, and cetirizine are examples of second-generation antihistamines. Both first- and second-generation antihistamines are effective at controlling symptoms of AR. Still, first-generation antihistamines can be quite sedating due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. These agents also act on muscarinic receptors, causing side effects of dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and/or tachycardia. Second-generation antihistamines have improved H1 selectivity, are less sedating, and have longer half-lives (12 to 24 hours) than those of the first-generation. Fexofenadine has no sedating effects, but loratadine and desloratadine may be sedating at higher doses. Cetirizine has the most potential for sedation of all second-generation antihistamines. There is no one agent recommended over others, as all have shown similar efficacy and safety profiles in terms of symptom relief. [5]  Intranasal antihistamines, such as azelastine, have a rapid onset and are more efficacious than oral antihistamines in relieving nasal symptoms. They are recommended as first or second-line therapies for AR and can be used in conjunction with topical nasal steroid sprays with a synergistic effect. [10] Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) such as montelukast and zafirlukast can be beneficial in patients with AR, but they are not as efficacious as intranasal corticosteroids. [13]  Their use is often in combination therapy with other agents for severe or refractory symptoms. For patients in whom avoidance measures and combination pharmacotherapy are not effective, allergen immunotherapy should be considered.  Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) are commonly used therapies. Weekly incremental doses are given for 6 to 8 months, followed by maintenance doses for 3 to 5 years. Typically, patients experience a prolonged, protective effect, and therapy can be ceased. [1] Oral decongestants such as pseudoephedrine are useful in relieving symptoms but are not recommended for extended daily use due to their side-effect profile. Intranasal decongestants such as xylometazoline are alpha-agonists that are delivered directly to nasal tissue to produce vasoconstriction. Prolonged use of intranasal decongestants has a risk of causing rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa) and, therefore, should not be used for more than a week. [10] Sodium cromoglycate (Cromolyn) effectively reduces sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis, so it is a reasonable option. Surgical treatment is reserved for patients with nasal polyposis, inferior turbinate hypertrophy causing intractable nasal obstruction, or chronic sinus disease refractory to medical treatment. [5]  Budesonide is the only FDA-approved agent for pregnant patients experiencing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. [1]  Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is beneficial in patients with AR, although the cost associated with therapy is a limiting factor in its use. [14]  Nasal saline can be another option in conjunction with other treatment modalities. Isotonic solutions are more beneficial in adults, whereas hypertonic solutions may be more effective in children. [10] Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for AR includes other forms of rhinitis that are not allergic. Children, particularly those under the age of 2 years, should also be assessed for congenital causes of nasal obstruction, such as choanal atresia and immunodeficiencies. [2] [6] [10] Vasomotor rhinitis - noninflammatory rhinitis that can be triggered by a change in temperature, odors, or humidity Infectious rhinitis - viral or bacterial infections, most commonly seen in the pediatric population Cerebrospinal fluid leak - clear rhinitis refractory to treatment Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) - infiltration of eosinophils in nasal tissue without allergic sensitization Chemical rhinitis - exposure to chemicals through occupation, household chemicals, sport/leisure exposure Rhinitis of pregnancy and hormonally-induced rhinitis Drug-induced rhinitis - e.g., NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, nasal decongestants, cocaine Autoimmune, granulomatous, and vasculitic rhinitis - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis, etc. Nasal polyposis Nasopharyngeal neoplasm Sickle cell anemia - in a young child presenting with nasal polyposis and well-controlled asthma, sweat chloride testing is the appropriate next step in management to rule out cystic fibrosis. Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials In studies comparing the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on topical antihistamines and oral antihistamines, intranasal steroids were proven to be more beneficial in relieving sneezing symptoms, rhinorrhea,  and nasal pruritis and blockage and are, therefore, recommended as first-line therapy for all patients with AR. [15]  There is great evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy for AR and allergic asthma, and it is the only disease-modifying intervention in allergic conditions. [16] Anti-H3 and H4 antihistamines are currently under study for use in AR, but no agents have received approval yet. Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved for patients with COPD, has been proven to be beneficial in AR in one small study, but further studies to confirm results are lacking. A new route of administration for immunotherapy is the injection of allergens directly into lymph nodes. It has been proven to induce a 10-fold higher allergen-specific IgG response that is demonstrated by improved efficacy and safety. Dapilumab, a fully-humanized monoclonal antibody, improved AR-related nasal symptoms in a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It works by inhibiting the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, which are both key drivers of immune diseases. Novel therapeutic approaches such as these are in development or clinical trials and look promising in the treatment of AR. [16] Prognosis The belief is that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis peaks in adolescence and gradually decreases with advancing age. In a longitudinal study, at the time of the 23-year follow-up, 54.9% of patients showed improvement in symptoms, with 41.6% of those being symptom-free. Patients who had an onset of symptoms at a younger age were more likely to show improvement. The severity of AR can vary over time and depends on various factors such as location and season. [17]  Approximately 50% of patients receiving grass allergy immunotherapy noted improvement in symptoms that continued 3 years after discontinuation of therapy. [18] Complications Chronic rhinosinusitis, although distinct from allergic rhinitis, can be a complication of AR. It is characterized by nasal inflammation with symptoms of nasal congestion or discharge, ongoing for longer than 3 months. Chronic rhinosinusitis may also demonstrate findings of nasal polyps (nasal polyposis), which form as a result of chronic inflammation of the paranasal sinus mucosa. Nasal polyps are typically benign and present bilaterally. Unilateral nasal polyps should raise concerns for malignancy. The incidence of nasal polyps in the general population is approximately 4% and is more common in males. Treatment options include topical steroids and saline irrigation. Surgical removal is reserved for patients who do not respond to medical therapy. [1] It is also known that sensitization to allergens in AR can alter the immunological parameters of the adenoids, resulting in adenoid hypertrophy. [4] Eustachian tube dysfunction commonly manifests in patients with AR and presents as ear fullness, otalgia, and ear-popping. Approximately 10 to 40% of patients with AR also have concurrent asthma, and some studies suggest asthma is more common in moderate to severe persistent rhinitis. Many studies have demonstrated AR to be an independent risk factor for asthma, especially in patients diagnosed with AR during infancy. Some other associated complications include otitis media with effusion, persistent cough, and eosinophilic esophagitis, although there is a need to define the link more clearly. [10]   Patients undergoing allergen desensitization (allergy shots) can experience an acute exacerbation of rhinitis or asthma, or, in a worst-case scenario, the patient could progress to anaphylaxis. Therefore, staff members in offices that provide this therapy should be well-versed in the diagnosis and management of such severe reactions and have the appropriate emergency medications (especially epinephrine) and airway management equipment immediately available. [19] [20] Consultations Allergic rhinitis is most often diagnosed and managed by primary care physicians/providers. However, patients who fail traditional therapies for AR are eligible for referral to a specialist, such as an allergist or an otolaryngologist (ENT) with an allergy focus. Patients who are deemed candidates for immunotherapy typically obtain a referral to allergists for therapy. Specific findings on the physical exam should also prompt a referral, such as multiple nasal polyps in a pediatric patient, which is highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Patients who present with bloody or unilateral nasal discharge (not basic epistaxis) should be urgently referred to an ENT to rule out malignancy. Any concern for cerebrospinal fluid leak causing rhinorrhea also warrants referral to an ENT specialist. [21] Deterrence and Patient Education Patients often underestimate the severity of this condition and fail to seek medical therapy. It is important to adequately control AR, especially due to the link between AR and asthma, with poor control of rhinitis predicting poor control of asthma. [22] Patient compliance with the treatment regimen is crucial for the alleviation of symptoms. Patients should receive educational materials with information about allergic rhinitis and its implications. Moreover, patient education on the proper administration of nasal sprays also plays an essential role in a patient's response to therapy. [23]  Patients should be advised to look down and squirt nasal spray just inside the nostril, aiming toward the outer walls on both sides. It should be stressed that the patient should not take a deep breath or sniff hard after spraying. [15]  Counseling patients on the avoidance of known allergens is a necessary but time-consuming task. [23] Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes According to the \\\"ecology of medical care\\\" model, only a minority of patients seek medical care for their symptoms, and most of these are managed by their primary care physician (PCP) and a nurse practitioner. Therefore, it is crucial to provide patients with information on self-management and when to contact their PCP. The involvement of community pharmacists and nurse practitioners can play a vital role in achieving these goals. However, patients who fail traditional therapies for AR are eligible for referral to a specialist, such as an allergist or an otolaryngologist (ENT) with an allergy focus. Patients who are deemed candidates for immunotherapy typically obtain a referral to allergists for therapy. Specific findings on the physical exam should also prompt a referral, such as multiple nasal polyps in a pediatric patient, which is highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Patients who present with bloody or unilateral nasal discharge (not basic epistaxis) should be urgently referred to an ENT to rule out malignancy. Any concern for cerebrospinal fluid leak causing rhinorrhea also warrants referral to an ENT specialist. [21] PCPs, nurse practitioners, and allergy specialists often work closely in co-managing patients with AR. The interprofessional team must work as a team to educate the patient and family. After an initial evaluation and a treatment plan is in place, the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, and physician must work together to assure the patient improves and, if not, receives additional evaluation. Access to healthcare and specialists varies globally, but when available, PCPs, pediatricians, allergists, and/or ENT specialists working with specialty-trained ENT nurses and clinicians will result in the best outcomes.

This condition is caused by the body’s immune system overreacting to airborne allergens such as pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n#### Symptoms\\nCommon symptoms of hay fever include:\\n- Sneezing\\n- Runny nose\\n- Nasal congestion\\n- Itchy eyes, throat, or nose\\n- Watery eyes\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue (which can often be due to poor sleep as a result of nasal obstructions)\\n\\nSymptoms can vary from person to person and may worsen during specific seasons or when exposed to specific allergens.\\n\\n#### Triggers\\nHay fever can arise from various allergens:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: Tree pollen (spring), grass pollen (summer), ragweed pollen (late summer and fall).\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, mold.\\n- **Irritants**: Cigarette smoke, strong odors (e.g., perfume), fumes from cleaning products, air pollutants.\\n\\n#### Causes\\nHay fever occurs when the immune system identifies a harmless substance as a threat and overreacts by producing immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies come into contact with the allergen, the body releases chemicals like histamine, leading to allergic symptoms.\\n\\n#### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of allergic rhinitis involves:\\n- Reviewing medical history and symptoms.\\n- Conducting allergy tests (skin prick tests or blood tests) to identify specific triggers.\\n- Sometimes evaluating for complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps that could exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\n#### Management and Treatment\\n1. **Avoiding Allergens**: The first line of defense is avoiding known triggers. This includes:\\n   - Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n   - Using air conditioning to filter allergens.\\n   - Wearing sunglasses outdoors to protect eyes from pollen.\\n   - Keeping pets out of sleeping areas.\\n\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Help relieve symptoms like sneezing and itching. These can be found in oral form or nasal sprays.\\n   - **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Highly effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n   - **Decongestants**: Help relieve nasal stuffiness but are usually short-term treatments.\\n   - **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block chemicals in the body that contribute to allergic reactions.\\n   - **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can help build tolerance to allergens over time.\\n\\n3. **Non-Medication Strategies**:\\n   - Nasal saline rinses to clear irritants.\\n   - Use of HEPA filters for air purification in homes.\\n   - Regular cleaning to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n#### Complications\\nIf left unmanaged, hay fever can lead to:\\n- Poor sleep quality and daytime fatigue.\\n- Increased risk of developing asthma or other allergic conditions.\\n- Sinusitis or ear infections in some individuals, especially children.\\n\\n#### When to See a Doctor\\nConsult an allergist if:\\n- Symptoms are severe and disrupt daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about associated conditions like asthma or recurrent infections.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nHay fever is a common and manageable condition. Effective treatments are available that can alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Consulting with an allergist can be beneficial in developing a personalized management plan.\\n\\n**Sources**:\\n- Cleveland Clinic [Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever): Symptoms & Treatment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- Mayo Clinic [Hay fever - Symptoms and causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- ACAAI [Hay Fever (Rhinitis) | Symptoms & Treatment](https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/hay-fever/)\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

It affects one in six individuals and is associated with significant morbidity, loss of productivity, and healthcare costs. Historically,  AR was thought to be a disease process of the nasal airway alone. Still, the development of the unified airway theory has classified AR as a component of systemic allergic response, with other associated conditions, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis, sharing an underlying systemic pathology. [1]  AR can be classified as either seasonal (intermittent) or perennial (chronic), with approximately 20% of cases being seasonal, 40% perennial, and 40% with features of both. [2] In addition to nasal symptoms, patients with AR may also present with associated allergic conjunctivitis, non-productive cough, Eustachian tube dysfunction, and chronic sinusitis. Once diagnosed, AR is treatable with a variety of modalities, with intra-nasal glucocorticoids being the first-line therapy. [1] Etiology The allergic response is classified into early and late-phase reactions. In the early phase, allergic rhinitis is an immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated response against inhaled allergens that cause inflammation driven by type 2 helper (Th2) cells. [2]  The initial response occurs within five to 15 minutes of exposure to an antigen, resulting in the degranulation of host mast cells. This releases a variety of pre-formed and newly synthesized mediators, including histamine, which is one of the primary mediators of allergic rhinitis. Histamine induces sneezing via the trigeminal nerve and also plays a role in rhinorrhea by stimulating mucous glands. Other immune mediators, such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, are also implicated as they act on blood vessels to cause nasal congestion. Four to six hours after the initial response, an influx of cytokines, such as interleukins (IL)-4 and IL-13, from mast cells occurs, signifying the development of the late-phase response. These cytokines, in turn, facilitate the infiltration of eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, and basophils into the nasal mucosa and produce nasal edema with resultant congestion. [3] Non-IgE-mediated hyperresponsiveness can develop due to eosinophilic infiltration and nasal mucosal obliteration. The nasal mucosa now becomes hyperreactive to normal stimuli (such as tobacco smoke and cold air) and causes symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis. [4] There are data to suggest a genetic component to allergic rhinitis, but high-quality studies are generally lacking. Monozygotic twins show 45% to 60% concordance, and dizygotic twins have a concordance rate of approximately 25% in the development of AR. Specific regions on chromosomes 3 and 4 also correlate with allergic responses. [5] Epidemiology The prevalence of allergic rhinitis based on physician diagnosis is approximately 15%; however, the prevalence is estimated to be as high as 30% based on patients with nasal symptoms. AR is known to peak in the second to fourth decades of life and then gradually decline. [6]  The incidence of AR in the pediatric population is also quite high, making it one of the most common chronic pediatric disorders. According to data from the International Study for Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, 14.6% in the 13 to 14 year age group and 8.5% in the 6 to 7 year age group display symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis linked to allergic rhinitis. [7] Seasonal allergic rhinitis seems to be more common in the pediatric age group, whereas chronic rhinitis is more prevalent in adults. [8] A systematic review from 2018 estimated that 3.6% of adults had missed work, and 36% had impaired work performance due to allergic rhinitis. Economic evaluations have shown that indirect costs associated with lost work productivity account for the majority of the cost burden for AR. [9]   Risk factors for developing AR include a family history of atopy, male sex, a presence of allergen-specific IgE, a serum IgE greater than 100 IU/mL before age 6, and higher socioeconomic status. [5] Studies in young children have shown a higher risk of AR in those with an early introduction to foods or formula and/or heavy exposure to cigarette smoking in the first year of life. [2] Although many recent studies have evaluated the link between pollution and the development of AR, no significant correlation yet exists. Interestingly, there are several factors identified that may have a protective effect on the development of AR. The role of breastfeeding in the development of AR is often debated, but it is still recommended due to its many other known benefits and no associated harms. There is no evidence that pet avoidance in childhood prevents AR; however, it is hypothesized that early pet exposure may induce immune tolerance. There is a growing interest in the \\\"farm effect\\\" on the development of allergies, and a meta-analysis of 8 studies showed a 40% lower risk in subjects who had lived on a farm during their first year of life. [10] History and Physical Taking a thorough, detailed history is an essential part of the evaluation of AR, and questions should focus on the types of symptoms, the time, duration, and frequency of symptoms, suspected exposures, exacerbating/alleviating factors, and seasonality. [10]  Patients with intermittent or seasonal allergic rhinitis have symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes, while patients with chronic AR often complain of postnasal drip, chronic nasal congestion, and obstruction. [8]  These patients will often have a family history of allergic rhinitis or a personal history of asthma. Patients with intermittent rhinitis may report triggers such as pollens, animal dander, flooring/upholstery, mold, humidity, perfumes, and/or tobacco smoke. [11] On physical examination, clinicians may notice mouth breathing, frequent sniffling and/or throat clearing, transverse supra-tip nasal crease, and dark circles under the eyes (allergic shiners). Nasal supratip crease is more common in children. Anterior rhinoscopy typically reveals swelling of the nasal mucosa and thin, clear secretions. The inferior turbinates may take on a bluish hue, and cobblestoning of the nasal mucosa may be present. Whenever possible, an internal endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity should be conducted to assess for nasal polyps and structural abnormalities. Pneumatic otoscopy can be used to assess for eustachian tube dysfunction, which can be a common finding in patients with allergic rhinitis. Palpation of sinuses may elicit tenderness in patients with chronic symptoms. These patients should also undergo careful examination for signs of asthma or dermatitis and should be questioned regarding aspirin sensitivity. [11] Evaluation Allergic rhinitis is largely a clinical diagnosis made based on a thorough history and physical. A positive response to empiric treatment with a nasal glucocorticoid can support the diagnosis. A formal diagnosis is possible with either serum testing for allergen-specific IgE or allergy skin testing. [6] As stated by the American Academy of Otolaryngology guidelines, allergy testing should be reserved for patients who are unresponsive to empiric treatment or require the identification of a specific allergen to target therapy. [1]  Serum testing does not require trained technicians, and the patient does not need to stop taking antihistamines in advance. Intradermal allergy testing does require a trained professional to perform testing, but results are available immediately. In patients with seasonal symptoms, testing should be performed during the peak symptoms season in order to best identify specific triggers. [6]  Skin testing is known to have slightly superior sensitivity to serum testing and is more cost-effective. Contraindications to skin allergy testing include patients with uncontrolled or severe asthma, unstable cardiovascular disease, pregnancy, and/or concurrent beta-blocker therapy. H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab can interfere with allergy skin test response; therefore, cessation is advisable before testing. [10] Radiographic imaging is not routinely recommended for the diagnosis of AR and is primarily used to rule out other conditions, such as rhinosinusitis. [10] Treatment / Management Avoidance of triggers, especially in those with seasonal symptoms, is encouraged, although it is not always practical. Precautions can be taken to avoid dust mites, animal dander, and upholstery, though this can require significant lifestyle changes that may not be acceptable to the patient. If removing a pet from the home is not feasible, isolating the pet to a single room in the house may be an option to minimize dander exposure. It may take up to 20 weeks to eliminate cat dander from the home, even after removing the animal.  Allergen-impermeable bedding covers, washing sheets in hot water, and the use of a vacuum cleaner with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters may also lessen symptoms. [5]   Pharmacological options include antihistamines, intranasal steroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), and immunotherapy. Intranasal corticosteroid therapy can be as monotherapy or in combination with oral antihistamines in patients in patients with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms. Studies have shown intranasal corticosteroids are superior to antihistamines in effectively reducing nasal inflammation and improving mucosal pathology. Thus a topical intranasal steroid should be the first-line treatment for AR. [12]  Commonly available nasal sprays in the United States include beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, and triamcinolone acetonide. Proper administration of nasal spray is critical in achieving an optimal clinical response and avoiding side effects; therefore, patients should always receive counsel on the appropriate use of devices. They should be used regularly, as their peak effect may take multiple days to develop. The spray bottle's tip should be placed just inside the naris and aimed laterally towards the ipsilateral eye to minimize contact of the product with the nasal septum. The most common side effect reported is nasal irritation, followed by epistaxis, both of which can be prevented by spraying away from the nasal septum. [11]  Oral and injectable steroids have been shown to alleviate symptoms of AR but are not recommended for routine use due to their significant systemic side-effect profile. [10] First-generation antihistamines include diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine, whereas fexofenadine, loratadine, desloratadine, and cetirizine are examples of second-generation antihistamines. Both first- and second-generation antihistamines are effective at controlling symptoms of AR. Still, first-generation antihistamines can be quite sedating due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. These agents also act on muscarinic receptors, causing side effects of dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and/or tachycardia. Second-generation antihistamines have improved H1 selectivity, are less sedating, and have longer half-lives (12 to 24 hours) than those of the first-generation. Fexofenadine has no sedating effects, but loratadine and desloratadine may be sedating at higher doses. Cetirizine has the most potential for sedation of all second-generation antihistamines. There is no one agent recommended over others, as all have shown similar efficacy and safety profiles in terms of symptom relief. [5]  Intranasal antihistamines, such as azelastine, have a rapid onset and are more efficacious than oral antihistamines in relieving nasal symptoms. They are recommended as first or second-line therapies for AR and can be used in conjunction with topical nasal steroid sprays with a synergistic effect. [10] Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) such as montelukast and zafirlukast can be beneficial in patients with AR, but they are not as efficacious as intranasal corticosteroids. [13]  Their use is often in combination therapy with other agents for severe or refractory symptoms. For patients in whom avoidance measures and combination pharmacotherapy are not effective, allergen immunotherapy should be considered.  Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) are commonly used therapies. Weekly incremental doses are given for 6 to 8 months, followed by maintenance doses for 3 to 5 years. Typically, patients experience a prolonged, protective effect, and therapy can be ceased. [1] Oral decongestants such as pseudoephedrine are useful in relieving symptoms but are not recommended for extended daily use due to their side-effect profile. Intranasal decongestants such as xylometazoline are alpha-agonists that are delivered directly to nasal tissue to produce vasoconstriction. Prolonged use of intranasal decongestants has a risk of causing rebound nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa) and, therefore, should not be used for more than a week. [10] Sodium cromoglycate (Cromolyn) effectively reduces sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis, so it is a reasonable option. Surgical treatment is reserved for patients with nasal polyposis, inferior turbinate hypertrophy causing intractable nasal obstruction, or chronic sinus disease refractory to medical treatment. [5]  Budesonide is the only FDA-approved agent for pregnant patients experiencing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. [1]  Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is beneficial in patients with AR, although the cost associated with therapy is a limiting factor in its use. [14]  Nasal saline can be another option in conjunction with other treatment modalities. Isotonic solutions are more beneficial in adults, whereas hypertonic solutions may be more effective in children. [10] Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for AR includes other forms of rhinitis that are not allergic. Children, particularly those under the age of 2 years, should also be assessed for congenital causes of nasal obstruction, such as choanal atresia and immunodeficiencies. [2] [6] [10] Vasomotor rhinitis - noninflammatory rhinitis that can be triggered by a change in temperature, odors, or humidity Infectious rhinitis - viral or bacterial infections, most commonly seen in the pediatric population Cerebrospinal fluid leak - clear rhinitis refractory to treatment Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) - infiltration of eosinophils in nasal tissue without allergic sensitization Chemical rhinitis - exposure to chemicals through occupation, household chemicals, sport/leisure exposure Rhinitis of pregnancy and hormonally-induced rhinitis Drug-induced rhinitis - e.g., NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, nasal decongestants, cocaine Autoimmune, granulomatous, and vasculitic rhinitis - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis, etc. Nasal polyposis Nasopharyngeal neoplasm Sickle cell anemia - in a young child presenting with nasal polyposis and well-controlled asthma, sweat chloride testing is the appropriate next step in management to rule out cystic fibrosis. Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials In studies comparing the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on topical antihistamines and oral antihistamines, intranasal steroids were proven to be more beneficial in relieving sneezing symptoms, rhinorrhea,  and nasal pruritis and blockage and are, therefore, recommended as first-line therapy for all patients with AR. [15]  There is great evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy for AR and allergic asthma, and it is the only disease-modifying intervention in allergic conditions. [16] Anti-H3 and H4 antihistamines are currently under study for use in AR, but no agents have received approval yet. Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved for patients with COPD, has been proven to be beneficial in AR in one small study, but further studies to confirm results are lacking. A new route of administration for immunotherapy is the injection of allergens directly into lymph nodes. It has been proven to induce a 10-fold higher allergen-specific IgG response that is demonstrated by improved efficacy and safety. Dapilumab, a fully-humanized monoclonal antibody, improved AR-related nasal symptoms in a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It works by inhibiting the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, which are both key drivers of immune diseases. Novel therapeutic approaches such as these are in development or clinical trials and look promising in the treatment of AR. [16] Prognosis The belief is that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis peaks in adolescence and gradually decreases with advancing age. In a longitudinal study, at the time of the 23-year follow-up, 54.9% of patients showed improvement in symptoms, with 41.6% of those being symptom-free. Patients who had an onset of symptoms at a younger age were more likely to show improvement. The severity of AR can vary over time and depends on various factors such as location and season. [17]  Approximately 50% of patients receiving grass allergy immunotherapy noted improvement in symptoms that continued 3 years after discontinuation of therapy. [18] Complications Chronic rhinosinusitis, although distinct from allergic rhinitis, can be a complication of AR. It is characterized by nasal inflammation with symptoms of nasal congestion or discharge, ongoing for longer than 3 months. Chronic rhinosinusitis may also demonstrate findings of nasal polyps (nasal polyposis), which form as a result of chronic inflammation of the paranasal sinus mucosa. Nasal polyps are typically benign and present bilaterally. Unilateral nasal polyps should raise concerns for malignancy. The incidence of nasal polyps in the general population is approximately 4% and is more common in males. Treatment options include topical steroids and saline irrigation. Surgical removal is reserved for patients who do not respond to medical therapy. [1] It is also known that sensitization to allergens in AR can alter the immunological parameters of the adenoids, resulting in adenoid hypertrophy. [4] Eustachian tube dysfunction commonly manifests in patients with AR and presents as ear fullness, otalgia, and ear-popping. Approximately 10 to 40% of patients with AR also have concurrent asthma, and some studies suggest asthma is more common in moderate to severe persistent rhinitis. Many studies have demonstrated AR to be an independent risk factor for asthma, especially in patients diagnosed with AR during infancy. Some other associated complications include otitis media with effusion, persistent cough, and eosinophilic esophagitis, although there is a need to define the link more clearly. [10]   Patients undergoing allergen desensitization (allergy shots) can experience an acute exacerbation of rhinitis or asthma, or, in a worst-case scenario, the patient could progress to anaphylaxis. Therefore, staff members in offices that provide this therapy should be well-versed in the diagnosis and management of such severe reactions and have the appropriate emergency medications (especially epinephrine) and airway management equipment immediately available. [19] [20] Consultations Allergic rhinitis is most often diagnosed and managed by primary care physicians/providers. However, patients who fail traditional therapies for AR are eligible for referral to a specialist, such as an allergist or an otolaryngologist (ENT) with an allergy focus. Patients who are deemed candidates for immunotherapy typically obtain a referral to allergists for therapy. Specific findings on the physical exam should also prompt a referral, such as multiple nasal polyps in a pediatric patient, which is highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Patients who present with bloody or unilateral nasal discharge (not basic epistaxis) should be urgently referred to an ENT to rule out malignancy. Any concern for cerebrospinal fluid leak causing rhinorrhea also warrants referral to an ENT specialist. [21] Deterrence and Patient Education Patients often underestimate the severity of this condition and fail to seek medical therapy. It is important to adequately control AR, especially due to the link between AR and asthma, with poor control of rhinitis predicting poor control of asthma. [22] Patient compliance with the treatment regimen is crucial for the alleviation of symptoms. Patients should receive educational materials with information about allergic rhinitis and its implications. Moreover, patient education on the proper administration of nasal sprays also plays an essential role in a patient's response to therapy. [23]  Patients should be advised to look down and squirt nasal spray just inside the nostril, aiming toward the outer walls on both sides. It should be stressed that the patient should not take a deep breath or sniff hard after spraying. [15]  Counseling patients on the avoidance of known allergens is a necessary but time-consuming task. [23] Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes According to the \\\"ecology of medical care\\\" model, only a minority of patients seek medical care for their symptoms, and most of these are managed by their primary care physician (PCP) and a nurse practitioner. Therefore, it is crucial to provide patients with information on self-management and when to contact their PCP. The involvement of community pharmacists and nurse practitioners can play a vital role in achieving these goals. However, patients who fail traditional therapies for AR are eligible for referral to a specialist, such as an allergist or an otolaryngologist (ENT) with an allergy focus. Patients who are deemed candidates for immunotherapy typically obtain a referral to allergists for therapy. Specific findings on the physical exam should also prompt a referral, such as multiple nasal polyps in a pediatric patient, which is highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Patients who present with bloody or unilateral nasal discharge (not basic epistaxis) should be urgently referred to an ENT to rule out malignancy. Any concern for cerebrospinal fluid leak causing rhinorrhea also warrants referral to an ENT specialist. [21] PCPs, nurse practitioners, and allergy specialists often work closely in co-managing patients with AR. The interprofessional team must work as a team to educate the patient and family. After an initial evaluation and a treatment plan is in place, the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, and physician must work together to assure the patient improves and, if not, receives additional evaluation. Access to healthcare and specialists varies globally, but when available, PCPs, pediatricians, allergists, and/or ENT specialists working with specialty-trained ENT nurses and clinicians will result in the best outcomes.

When exposed to these allergens, the body produces an inflammatory response similar to that of a cold, resulting in symptoms such as sneezing, nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus pressure. Common triggers include pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites. Given its widespread impact, hay fever affects millions globally and can significantly impair one's quality of life.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can be both bothersome and debilitating. Common manifestations include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A reflex action resulting from nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny nose**: Typically accompanied by clear discharge.\\n- **Nasal congestion**: Leads to difficulty breathing through the nose.\\n- **Itchy eyes, throat, or nose**: Often accompanied by redness and swelling.\\n- **Watery eyes**: Increased tearing due to allergic response.\\n- **Postnasal drip**: Leading to cough, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Frequently a result of disrupted sleep due to nasal obstruction.\\n\\nThe severity and presentation of these symptoms can vary based on individual sensitivity to allergens and seasonal variations.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by a variety of allergens, which are typically classified into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: These include tree pollen in spring, grass pollen in summer, and ragweed pollen in late summer and fall. \\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Common year-round triggers include dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, and mold spores.\\n- **Irritants**: Certain environmental factors like cigarette smoke, strong odors (such as perfumes), fumes from cleaning products, and air pollutants can also exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and mitigating exposure to these triggers is crucial in managing the condition.\\n\\n## Causes\\nDuring an allergic reaction, the immune system mistakenly identifies a harmless substance as a threatening allergen. This leads to the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies encounter the allergen, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which cause the myriad of symptoms associated with hay fever.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally involves:\\n- A comprehensive review of the patient’s medical history and reported symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests, which may include skin prick tests or blood tests to identify specific allergens.\\n- In some cases, assessing for related complications such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nA correct diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and management.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe primary strategy in managing hay fever is to avoid known allergens:\\n- Keep windows closed during high pollen seasons and utilize air conditioning.\\n- Wear sunglasses outdoors to shield the eyes from pollen.\\n- Maintain clean environments by using air purifiers and keeping up with regular cleaning schedules to reduce exposure to dust and mold.\\n\\n### 2. Medications\\nMedications to relieve symptoms may include:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Effective for sneezing, itching, and runny nose.

This reaction leads to symptoms that resemble a cold, such as sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus discomfort. Common triggers for hay fever include pollen from trees, grass, pet fur, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nPeople with hay fever may experience several symptoms, which can significantly disrupt daily life. These include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A rapid expulsion of air from the nose that occurs due to nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny Nose**: Often produces clear mucus.\\n- **Nasal Congestion**: Difficulty breathing through the nose due to swelling and inflammation.\\n- **Itchy Eyes/Nose/Throat**: Leads to discomfort and redness, often associated with swelling.\\n- **Watery Eyes**: Increased tearing as a response to allergens.\\n- **Postnasal Drip**: Mucus accumulation in the throat, leading to coughing, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Often results from poor sleep quality when nasal passages are congested.\\n\\nThe severity and timing of these symptoms can differ based on individual reactions and the presence of specific allergens throughout different seasons.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by several allergens which can be categorized into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: \\n  - **Tree Pollen**: Common in spring.\\n  - **Grass Pollen**: Peaks in summer.\\n  - **Ragweed Pollen**: Found in late summer and fall.\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: \\n  - **Dust Mites**: Tiny creatures that thrive in household dust.\\n  - **Pet Dander**: Flecks of skin shed by furry pets.\\n  - **Cockroach Droppings**: Waste matter from cockroaches.\\n  - **Mold Spores**: Produced by mold, especially in damp conditions.\\n- **Irritants**: Such as cigarette smoke, strong smells (like perfume), cleaning products, and pollution may cause or exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and avoiding these triggers is essential for effective management of hay fever.\\n\\n## Causes\\nHay fever happens when the immune system mistakenly perceives normally harmless substances as dangerous. This leads to the production of specific antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). When these antibodies meet the allergens, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which is responsible for most of the allergic symptoms.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally requires:\\n- A thorough discussion of the patient's medical history and current symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests (such as skin prick tests or blood tests) to pinpoint specific allergens.\\n- Assessments for any related complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nAccurate diagnosis is crucial to determining the most effective treatment plan.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe first step for managing hay fever is to minimize contact with known allergens:\\n- **Keep Windows Closed**: During high pollen seasons.\\n- **Use Air Conditioning**: Helps filter out allergens.\\n- **Wear Sunglasses**: Outdoors to shield eyes from pollen.\\n- **Limit Indoor Exposure**: Keep pets out of sleeping areas and frequently clean to reduce allergen accumulation.\\n\\n### 2. Medications\\nDifferent types of medications can be used to relieve symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Alleviate sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Available in pills and nasal spray forms.\\n- **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n- **Decongestants**: Reduce stuffiness but should be taken only short-term due to potential side effects.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block allergic reaction-triggering substances in the body.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Involves gradually introducing allergens to build tolerance, offered through allergy shots or oral tablets.\\n\\n### 3.

When exposed to these allergens, the body produces an inflammatory response similar to that of a cold, resulting in symptoms such as sneezing, nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus pressure. Common triggers include pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites. Given its widespread impact, hay fever affects millions globally and can significantly impair one's quality of life.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can be both bothersome and debilitating. Common manifestations include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A reflex action resulting from nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny nose**: Typically accompanied by clear discharge.\\n- **Nasal congestion**: Leads to difficulty breathing through the nose.\\n- **Itchy eyes, throat, or nose**: Often accompanied by redness and swelling.\\n- **Watery eyes**: Increased tearing due to allergic response.\\n- **Postnasal drip**: Leading to cough, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Frequently a result of disrupted sleep due to nasal obstruction.\\n\\nThe severity and presentation of these symptoms can vary based on individual sensitivity to allergens and seasonal variations.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by a variety of allergens, which are typically classified into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: These include tree pollen in spring, grass pollen in summer, and ragweed pollen in late summer and fall. \\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Common year-round triggers include dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, and mold spores.\\n- **Irritants**: Certain environmental factors like cigarette smoke, strong odors (such as perfumes), fumes from cleaning products, and air pollutants can also exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and mitigating exposure to these triggers is crucial in managing the condition.\\n\\n## Causes\\nDuring an allergic reaction, the immune system mistakenly identifies a harmless substance as a threatening allergen. This leads to the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies encounter the allergen, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which cause the myriad of symptoms associated with hay fever.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally involves:\\n- A comprehensive review of the patient’s medical history and reported symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests, which may include skin prick tests or blood tests to identify specific allergens.\\n- In some cases, assessing for related complications such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nA correct diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and management.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe primary strategy in managing hay fever is to avoid known allergens:\\n- Keep windows closed during high pollen seasons and utilize air conditioning.\\n- Wear sunglasses outdoors to shield the eyes from pollen.\\n- Maintain clean environments by using air purifiers and keeping up with regular cleaning schedules to reduce exposure to dust and mold.\\n\\n### 2.

This reaction leads to symptoms that resemble a cold, such as sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus discomfort. Common triggers for hay fever include pollen from trees, grass, pet fur, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nPeople with hay fever may experience several symptoms, which can significantly disrupt daily life. These include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A rapid expulsion of air from the nose that occurs due to nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny Nose**: Often produces clear mucus.\\n- **Nasal Congestion**: Difficulty breathing through the nose due to swelling and inflammation.\\n- **Itchy Eyes/Nose/Throat**: Leads to discomfort and redness, often associated with swelling.\\n- **Watery Eyes**: Increased tearing as a response to allergens.\\n- **Postnasal Drip**: Mucus accumulation in the throat, leading to coughing, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Often results from poor sleep quality when nasal passages are congested.\\n\\nThe severity and timing of these symptoms can differ based on individual reactions and the presence of specific allergens throughout different seasons.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by several allergens which can be categorized into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: \\n  - **Tree Pollen**: Common in spring.\\n  - **Grass Pollen**: Peaks in summer.\\n  - **Ragweed Pollen**: Found in late summer and fall.\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: \\n  - **Dust Mites**: Tiny creatures that thrive in household dust.\\n  - **Pet Dander**: Flecks of skin shed by furry pets.\\n  - **Cockroach Droppings**: Waste matter from cockroaches.\\n  - **Mold Spores**: Produced by mold, especially in damp conditions.\\n- **Irritants**: Such as cigarette smoke, strong smells (like perfume), cleaning products, and pollution may cause or exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and avoiding these triggers is essential for effective management of hay fever.\\n\\n## Causes\\nHay fever happens when the immune system mistakenly perceives normally harmless substances as dangerous. This leads to the production of specific antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). When these antibodies meet the allergens, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which is responsible for most of the allergic symptoms.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally requires:\\n- A thorough discussion of the patient's medical history and current symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests (such as skin prick tests or blood tests) to pinpoint specific allergens.\\n- Assessments for any related complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nAccurate diagnosis is crucial to determining the most effective treatment plan.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe first step for managing hay fever is to minimize contact with known allergens:\\n- **Keep Windows Closed**: During high pollen seasons.\\n- **Use Air Conditioning**: Helps filter out allergens.\\n- **Wear Sunglasses**: Outdoors to shield eyes from pollen.\\n- **Limit Indoor Exposure**: Keep pets out of sleeping areas and frequently clean to reduce allergen accumulation.\\n\\n### 2. Medications\\nDifferent types of medications can be used to relieve symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Alleviate sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Available in pills and nasal spray forms.\\n- **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n- **Decongestants**: Reduce stuffiness but should be taken only short-term due to potential side effects.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block allergic reaction-triggering substances in the body.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Involves gradually introducing allergens to build tolerance, offered through allergy shots or oral tablets.\\n\\n### 3. Non-Medication Strategies\\nAdditional strategies to help manage symptoms include:\\n- **Nasal Saline Rinses**: Clear nasal passages of allergens.\\n- **HEPA Filters**: Use in home air systems to trap particles.\\n- **Regular Cleaning**: Wash bedding and clothes in hot water to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n## Complications\\nIf left untreated, hay fever can lead to several issues:\\n- **Poor Sleep Quality**: Resulting in daytime fatigue and decreased productivity.\\n- **Increased Risk of Asthma**: May develop alongside other allergic conditions.\\n- **Sinusitis or Ear Infections**: More common in children with untreated hay fever.\\n\\n## When to See a Doctor\\nIt is recommended to see a healthcare professional when:\\n- Symptoms greatly interfere with daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about potential complications like asthma.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever is a widespread yet manageable condition with various treatment options available.

This condition is caused by the body’s immune system overreacting to airborne allergens such as pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n#### Symptoms\\nCommon symptoms of hay fever include:\\n- Sneezing\\n- Runny nose\\n- Nasal congestion\\n- Itchy eyes, throat, or nose\\n- Watery eyes\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue (which can often be due to poor sleep as a result of nasal obstructions)\\n\\nSymptoms can vary from person to person and may worsen during specific seasons or when exposed to specific allergens.\\n\\n#### Triggers\\nHay fever can arise from various allergens:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: Tree pollen (spring), grass pollen (summer), ragweed pollen (late summer and fall).\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, mold.\\n- **Irritants**: Cigarette smoke, strong odors (e.g., perfume), fumes from cleaning products, air pollutants.\\n\\n#### Causes\\nHay fever occurs when the immune system identifies a harmless substance as a threat and overreacts by producing immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies come into contact with the allergen, the body releases chemicals like histamine, leading to allergic symptoms.\\n\\n#### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of allergic rhinitis involves:\\n- Reviewing medical history and symptoms.\\n- Conducting allergy tests (skin prick tests or blood tests) to identify specific triggers.\\n- Sometimes evaluating for complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps that could exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\n#### Management and Treatment\\n1. **Avoiding Allergens**: The first line of defense is avoiding known triggers. This includes:\\n   - Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n   - Using air conditioning to filter allergens.\\n   - Wearing sunglasses outdoors to protect eyes from pollen.\\n   - Keeping pets out of sleeping areas.\\n\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Help relieve symptoms like sneezing and itching. These can be found in oral form or nasal sprays.\\n   - **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Highly effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n   - **Decongestants**: Help relieve nasal stuffiness but are usually short-term treatments.\\n   - **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block chemicals in the body that contribute to allergic reactions.\\n   - **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can help build tolerance to allergens over time.\\n\\n3. **Non-Medication Strategies**:\\n   - Nasal saline rinses to clear irritants.\\n   - Use of HEPA filters for air purification in homes.\\n   - Regular cleaning to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n#### Complications\\nIf left unmanaged, hay fever can lead to:\\n- Poor sleep quality and daytime fatigue.\\n- Increased risk of developing asthma or other allergic conditions.\\n- Sinusitis or ear infections in some individuals, especially children.\\n\\n#### When to See a Doctor\\nConsult an allergist if:\\n- Symptoms are severe and disrupt daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about associated conditions like asthma or recurrent infections.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nHay fever is a common and manageable condition. Effective treatments are available that can alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Consulting with an allergist can be beneficial in developing a personalized management plan.\\n\\n**Sources**:\\n- Cleveland Clinic [Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever): Symptoms & Treatment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- Mayo Clinic [Hay fever - Symptoms and causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- ACAAI [Hay Fever (Rhinitis) | Symptoms & Treatment](https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/hay-fever/)\\n```\\n\\n----------\\n\\n# Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis) - Comprehensive Overview\\n\\n## Definition\\nHay fever, also known as allergic rhinitis, is a prevalent allergic condition characterized by an overreaction of the immune system to certain airborne allergens. When exposed to these allergens, the body produces an inflammatory response similar to that of a cold, resulting in symptoms such as sneezing, nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus pressure. Common triggers include pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mites. Given its widespread impact, hay fever affects millions globally and can significantly impair one's quality of life.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can be both bothersome and debilitating. Common manifestations include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A reflex action resulting from nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny nose**: Typically accompanied by clear discharge.\\n- **Nasal congestion**: Leads to difficulty breathing through the nose.\\n- **Itchy eyes, throat, or nose**: Often accompanied by redness and swelling.\\n- **Watery eyes**: Increased tearing due to allergic response.\\n- **Postnasal drip**: Leading to cough, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Frequently a result of disrupted sleep due to nasal obstruction.\\n\\nThe severity and presentation of these symptoms can vary based on individual sensitivity to allergens and seasonal variations.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by a variety of allergens, which are typically classified into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: These include tree pollen in spring, grass pollen in summer, and ragweed pollen in late summer and fall. \\n- **Perennial Allergens**: Common year-round triggers include dust mites, pet dander, cockroach droppings, and mold spores.\\n- **Irritants**: Certain environmental factors like cigarette smoke, strong odors (such as perfumes), fumes from cleaning products, and air pollutants can also exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and mitigating exposure to these triggers is crucial in managing the condition.\\n\\n## Causes\\nDuring an allergic reaction, the immune system mistakenly identifies a harmless substance as a threatening allergen. This leads to the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. When these antibodies encounter the allergen, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which cause the myriad of symptoms associated with hay fever.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally involves:\\n- A comprehensive review of the patient’s medical history and reported symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests, which may include skin prick tests or blood tests to identify specific allergens.\\n- In some cases, assessing for related complications such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nA correct diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and management.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe primary strategy in managing hay fever is to avoid known allergens:\\n- Keep windows closed during high pollen seasons and utilize air conditioning.\\n- Wear sunglasses outdoors to shield the eyes from pollen.\\n- Maintain clean environments by using air purifiers and keeping up with regular cleaning schedules to reduce exposure to dust and mold.\\n\\n### 2. Medications\\nMedications to relieve symptoms may include:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Effective for sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Available in oral formats and nasal sprays.\\n- **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Reduce inflammation and are considered the most effective treatment.\\n- **Decongestants**: Alleviate nasal congestion but should be used short-term due to potential rebound effects.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Work to block substances that contribute to the allergic response.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Gradual exposure to allergens can build tolerance and reduce symptoms over time.\\n\\n### 3. Non-Medication Strategies\\nAdditional strategies include:\\n- Nasal saline rinses to flush out irritants.\\n- Use of HEPA filters in home ventilation systems.\\n- Regular washing of bedding and clothing in hot water to eliminate dust mites.\\n\\n## Complications\\nIf hay fever is left unmanaged, complications can arise:\\n- Sleep disturbances leading to daytime fatigue.\\n- Increased likelihood of developing asthma and other allergic conditions.\\n- Potential development of sinusitis or ear infections, particularly in children.\\n\\n## When to See a Doctor\\nPatients should consult a healthcare professional when:\\n- Symptoms significantly disrupt daily living.\\n- Over-the-counter medications fail to provide relief.\\n- There are concerns regarding associated conditions such as asthma.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever is a common yet manageable condition, with a variety of effective treatments available that can significantly enhance an individual’s quality of life. Consulting with an allergist might provide additional insights and guidance on personalized management plans, ensuring optimal control of symptoms. Continuous education on avoidance strategies and treatment options is vital for those suffering from hay fever.\\n\\n## Sources\\n- Cleveland Clinic [Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever): Symptoms & Treatment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- Mayo Clinic [Hay fever - Symptoms and causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- ACAAI [Hay Fever (Rhinitis) | Symptoms & Treatment](https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/hay-fever/)\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

Most UTIs involve the lower urinary tract—particularly the bladder and urethra. Women are at a higher risk of developing UTIs compared to men due to anatomical differences.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nUTIs can manifest a variety of symptoms that generally include:\\n\\n- **Persistent Urge to Urinate:** A strong, unrelenting sensation to urinate.\\n- **Burning Sensation During Urination:** Dysuria, which is discomfort or pain when urinating.\\n- **Frequent Urination:** Increased frequency of urination, often with minimal urine output.\\n- **Cloudy or Bloody Urine:** Urine that appears murky, clouded, or may contain blood (hematuria).\\n- **Strong Urine Odor:** Noticeable foul smell from the urine.\\n- **Pelvic Pain:** Particularly in women, the pain is typically centered around the pelvic area and may accompany other symptoms.\\n\\nIn older adults, symptoms may present less clearly, and UTIs can be mistaken for other health issues.\\n\\n### Types of UTIs\\n- **Cystitis (Bladder Infection):** Most common, usually caused by Escherichia coli.\\n- **Urethritis (Urethra Infection):** Can occur when bacteria spread from the anus or during sexual intercourse.\\n\\n### Symptoms Based on UTI Location\\n- **Kidneys:** Back pain, high fever, chills, nausea, vomiting.\\n- **Bladder:** Pelvic pressure, discomfort in the lower abdomen, frequent and painful urination, blood in urine.\\n- **Urethra:** Painful urination and possible discharge.\\n\\n## Causes\\nUTIs typically originate from bacteria entering the urinary tract through the urethra and then multiplying in the bladder. Primary causative agents include:\\n\\n- **Escherichia coli (E. coli):** The most frequently identified bacteria in UTIs.\\n- **Other Bacteria:** Can include Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and more. \\n\\n### Risk Factors\\nRisk factors for developing UTIs include:\\n- **Female Anatomy:** Shorter urethra decreases travel distance for bacteria.\\n- **Sexual Activity:** Increased incidence linked to sexual intercourse.\\n- **Birth Control Methods:** Certain contraceptives can elevate UTI risk.\\n- **Post-Menopausal Changes:** Decreased estrogen levels impact urinary tract defense.\\n- **Urinary Tract Issues and Blockages:** Kidney stones, enlarged prostate, and congenital disorders.\\n- **Catheter Usage:** Increased likelihood of infection from prolonged catheter presence.\\n- **Impaired Immune System:** Conditions like diabetes enhance vulnerability.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhen UTIs are treated early and effectively, complications are rare; however, untreated infections can lead to severe health issues such as:\\n- **Recurrent UTIs:** Multiple infections within a year.\\n- **Kidney Damage:** From ascending infections.\\n- **Pregnancy Issues:** Premature birth or low birth weight in affected pregnancies.\\n- **Sepsis:** A critical systemic infection that can arise from severe urinary tract infections.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nDiagnosis typically involves:\\n- **Symptom Review:** Engaging with a healthcare provider about symptoms.\\n- **Urine Tests:** Checking for the presence of bacteria, blood, or other indicators of infection.\\n- **Imaging Tests:** May be utilized if recurrent infections occur.\\n\\nTreatment commonly involves antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria. The choice of antibiotic depends on the type of bacteria responsible for the infection.\\n\\n### Prevention Strategies\\nHelpful preventive measures include:\\n- **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water to promote frequent urination and flush bacteria.\\n- **Post-Sexual Activity Hygiene:** Urinating shortly after sex can aid in preventing bacteria travel.\\n- **Proper Wiping Technique:** Wiping from front to back post-bowel movement can minimize bacterial spread.\\n- **Avoiding Irritation:** Douching or using perfumed products near the genital area may increase irritation and infections.\\n- **Choosing Appropriate Birth Control:** Understanding how certain contraceptives can affect UTI risk is vital for women.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines and remaining aware of the symptoms and causes of UTIs, individuals can better protect themselves from these common infections.\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}, {\"description\": \"Using the information received, write a report, translating very technical terms into more common language.

Most UTIs involve the lower urinary tract—particularly the bladder and urethra. Women are at a higher risk of developing UTIs compared to men due to anatomical differences.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nUTIs can manifest a variety of symptoms that generally include:\\n\\n- **Persistent Urge to Urinate:** A strong, unrelenting sensation to urinate.\\n- **Burning Sensation During Urination:** Dysuria, which is discomfort or pain when urinating.\\n- **Frequent Urination:** Increased frequency of urination, often with minimal urine output.\\n- **Cloudy or Bloody Urine:** Urine that appears murky, clouded, or may contain blood (hematuria).\\n- **Strong Urine Odor:** Noticeable foul smell from the urine.\\n- **Pelvic Pain:** Particularly in women, the pain is typically centered around the pelvic area and may accompany other symptoms.\\n\\nIn older adults, symptoms may present less clearly, and UTIs can be mistaken for other health issues.\\n\\n### Types of UTIs\\n- **Cystitis (Bladder Infection):** Most common, usually caused by Escherichia coli.\\n- **Urethritis (Urethra Infection):** Can occur when bacteria spread from the anus or during sexual intercourse.\\n\\n### Symptoms Based on UTI Location\\n- **Kidneys:** Back pain, high fever, chills, nausea, vomiting.\\n- **Bladder:** Pelvic pressure, discomfort in the lower abdomen, frequent and painful urination, blood in urine.\\n- **Urethra:** Painful urination and possible discharge.\\n\\n## Causes\\nUTIs typically originate from bacteria entering the urinary tract through the urethra and then multiplying in the bladder. Primary causative agents include:\\n\\n- **Escherichia coli (E. coli):** The most frequently identified bacteria in UTIs.\\n- **Other Bacteria:** Can include Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and more. \\n\\n### Risk Factors\\nRisk factors for developing UTIs include:\\n- **Female Anatomy:** Shorter urethra decreases travel distance for bacteria.\\n- **Sexual Activity:** Increased incidence linked to sexual intercourse.\\n- **Birth Control Methods:** Certain contraceptives can elevate UTI risk.\\n- **Post-Menopausal Changes:** Decreased estrogen levels impact urinary tract defense.\\n- **Urinary Tract Issues and Blockages:** Kidney stones, enlarged prostate, and congenital disorders.\\n- **Catheter Usage:** Increased likelihood of infection from prolonged catheter presence.\\n- **Impaired Immune System:** Conditions like diabetes enhance vulnerability.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhen UTIs are treated early and effectively, complications are rare; however, untreated infections can lead to severe health issues such as:\\n- **Recurrent UTIs:** Multiple infections within a year.\\n- **Kidney Damage:** From ascending infections.\\n- **Pregnancy Issues:** Premature birth or low birth weight in affected pregnancies.\\n- **Sepsis:** A critical systemic infection that can arise from severe urinary tract infections.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nDiagnosis typically involves:\\n- **Symptom Review:** Engaging with a healthcare provider about symptoms.\\n- **Urine Tests:** Checking for the presence of bacteria, blood, or other indicators of infection.\\n- **Imaging Tests:** May be utilized if recurrent infections occur.\\n\\nTreatment commonly involves antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria. The choice of antibiotic depends on the type of bacteria responsible for the infection.\\n\\n### Prevention Strategies\\nHelpful preventive measures include:\\n- **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water to promote frequent urination and flush bacteria.\\n- **Post-Sexual Activity Hygiene:** Urinating shortly after sex can aid in preventing bacteria travel.\\n- **Proper Wiping Technique:** Wiping from front to back post-bowel movement can minimize bacterial spread.\\n- **Avoiding Irritation:** Douching or using perfumed products near the genital area may increase irritation and infections.\\n- **Choosing Appropriate Birth Control:** Understanding how certain contraceptives can affect UTI risk is vital for women.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines and remaining aware of the symptoms and causes of UTIs, individuals can better protect themselves from these common infections.\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_14", "context": {"span_id": "0x488711ef001c58ae", "trace_id": "0x6e6648ef59d6075daca44ae956fbc770"}, "parent_id": "0xbd0245efc8d405b2", "start_time": 1742219543035999098, "end_time": 1742219585621862023, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"ef7aef6200704343a56717e257cab137\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"1.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

It is crucial to consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment options, as the effectiveness of the antibiotic can depend on localized resistance patterns to specific drugs. In some cases, additional measures may be required if complications arise, such as kidney infections or repeated infections.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nUTIs are among the most common outpatient infections, accounting for over 8 million healthcare visits annually in the United States. About 60% of women and 12% of men will experience at least one UTI throughout their lifetime. The incidence of UTIs particularly increases with age, especially in older women.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nCertain strategies can help reduce the likelihood of developing a UTI:\\n- **Hydration**: Maintaining sufficient fluid intake, particularly water, helps dilute urine and promotes frequent urination, which can flush out bacteria.\\n- **Cranberry Products**: While research is inconclusive, cranberry juice is often touted for its potential preventive benefits.\\n- **Proper Hygiene**: Wiping from front to back after using the restroom helps reduce bacterial transfer from the rectum to the urethra.\\n- **Post-Sexual Activity Urination**: Urinating after sexual intercourse helps minimize the risk of infections.\\n- **Avoidance of Irritating Products**: Certain feminine hygiene products can irritate the urinary tract, leading to infections. \\n- **Contraceptive Choices**: Switching to non-irritating birth control methods may help decrease risk.\\n\\nIn summary, UTIs represent a significant healthcare challenge characterized by common symptoms and widely varied causative factors.

Understanding the nuances of their treatment and prevention is essential for effective management and preserving urinary health.\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_40", "context": {"span_id": "0x66bfe51880c24c6d", "trace_id": "0x6e6648ef59d6075daca44ae956fbc770"}, "parent_id": "0x488711ef001c58ae", "start_time": 1742219564393723704, "end_time": 1742219585466607602, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"ef7aef6200704343a56717e257cab137\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Senior Analyst\\n.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

Most UTIs involve the lower urinary tract—particularly the bladder and urethra. Women are at a higher risk of developing UTIs compared to men due to anatomical differences.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nUTIs can manifest a variety of symptoms that generally include:\\n\\n- **Persistent Urge to Urinate:** A strong, unrelenting sensation to urinate.\\n- **Burning Sensation During Urination:** Dysuria, which is discomfort or pain when urinating.\\n- **Frequent Urination:** Increased frequency of urination, often with minimal urine output.\\n- **Cloudy or Bloody Urine:** Urine that appears murky, clouded, or may contain blood (hematuria).\\n- **Strong Urine Odor:** Noticeable foul smell from the urine.\\n- **Pelvic Pain:** Particularly in women, the pain is typically centered around the pelvic area and may accompany other symptoms.\\n\\nIn older adults, symptoms may present less clearly, and UTIs can be mistaken for other health issues.\\n\\n### Types of UTIs\\n- **Cystitis (Bladder Infection):** Most common, usually caused by Escherichia coli.\\n- **Urethritis (Urethra Infection):** Can occur when bacteria spread from the anus or during sexual intercourse.\\n\\n### Symptoms Based on UTI Location\\n- **Kidneys:** Back pain, high fever, chills, nausea, vomiting.\\n- **Bladder:** Pelvic pressure, discomfort in the lower abdomen, frequent and painful urination, blood in urine.\\n- **Urethra:** Painful urination and possible discharge.\\n\\n## Causes\\nUTIs typically originate from bacteria entering the urinary tract through the urethra and then multiplying in the bladder. Primary causative agents include:\\n\\n- **Escherichia coli (E. coli):** The most frequently identified bacteria in UTIs.\\n- **Other Bacteria:** Can include Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and more. \\n\\n### Risk Factors\\nRisk factors for developing UTIs include:\\n- **Female Anatomy:** Shorter urethra decreases travel distance for bacteria.\\n- **Sexual Activity:** Increased incidence linked to sexual intercourse.\\n- **Birth Control Methods:** Certain contraceptives can elevate UTI risk.\\n- **Post-Menopausal Changes:** Decreased estrogen levels impact urinary tract defense.\\n- **Urinary Tract Issues and Blockages:** Kidney stones, enlarged prostate, and congenital disorders.\\n- **Catheter Usage:** Increased likelihood of infection from prolonged catheter presence.\\n- **Impaired Immune System:** Conditions like diabetes enhance vulnerability.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhen UTIs are treated early and effectively, complications are rare; however, untreated infections can lead to severe health issues such as:\\n- **Recurrent UTIs:** Multiple infections within a year.\\n- **Kidney Damage:** From ascending infections.\\n- **Pregnancy Issues:** Premature birth or low birth weight in affected pregnancies.\\n- **Sepsis:** A critical systemic infection that can arise from severe urinary tract infections.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nDiagnosis typically involves:\\n- **Symptom Review:** Engaging with a healthcare provider about symptoms.\\n- **Urine Tests:** Checking for the presence of bacteria, blood, or other indicators of infection.\\n- **Imaging Tests:** May be utilized if recurrent infections occur.\\n\\nTreatment commonly involves antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria. The choice of antibiotic depends on the type of bacteria responsible for the infection.\\n\\n### Prevention Strategies\\nHelpful preventive measures include:\\n- **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water to promote frequent urination and flush bacteria.\\n- **Post-Sexual Activity Hygiene:** Urinating shortly after sex can aid in preventing bacteria travel.\\n- **Proper Wiping Technique:** Wiping from front to back post-bowel movement can minimize bacterial spread.\\n- **Avoiding Irritation:** Douching or using perfumed products near the genital area may increase irritation and infections.\\n- **Choosing Appropriate Birth Control:** Understanding how certain contraceptives can affect UTI risk is vital for women.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines and remaining aware of the symptoms and causes of UTIs, individuals can better protect themselves from these common infections.\\n```\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"```\\nThought: I now can give a great answer\\nFinal Answer: \\n# Comprehensive Report on Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)\\n\\n## Overview\\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) occur in any part of the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.

Overview of Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect the nose, throat, and lungs. The flu is characterized by its sudden onset and can lead to mild to severe illness. In some cases, it can result in death, especially among high-risk groups. The flu typically circulates in seasonal epidemics, with a usual peak from October to May in North America. \\n\\nThe best method to mitigate the impacts of seasonal flu is through annual vaccination, which helps protect against the strains of the virus expected to be most prevalent in the upcoming season.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms of Influenza\\nFlu symptoms often appear suddenly and can include the following:\\n- **Fever or chills**: Many affected individuals may experience a fever, although not everyone will have one.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent cough is common.\\n- **Sore throat**: Soreness in the throat is frequently reported.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: This may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Muscle or body aches**: General discomfort and bodily pain are common.\\n- **Headaches**: Headaches can be a significant symptom.\\n- **Fatigue (tiredness)**: Many individuals report extreme fatigue with the flu.\\n- **Sweating and chills**: Sweating, coupled with chills, is often seen.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms such as ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may occur more frequently than in adults.\\n\\n## 3. How Influenza Spreads\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also be contracted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Notably, individuals can begin spreading the virus to others approximately one day before symptoms appear and can continue to do so for 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors for Complications\\nCertain populations are at greater risk for severe flu complications:\\n- **Young children**, especially those under 2 years old.\\n- **Elderly adults**, particularly those over 65 years old.\\n- Individuals with **weakened immune systems**.\\n- **Pregnant women**.\\n- People with **chronic medical conditions** such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\n## 5. Complications from the Flu\\nWhile many healthy individuals will recover within a week, the flu can pose significant complications for high-risk groups. Possible complications include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: A severe respiratory infection that can be life-threatening.\\n- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: A serious condition affecting breathing.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health issues**: Conditions such as asthma or heart disease can worsen following a flu infection.\\n- **Secondary bacterial infections**: To include sinus and ear infections.\\n- **Sepsis or toxic shock syndrome**: These serious conditions can also arise from influenza infection.\\n\\n## 6. Prevention of Influenza\\nVaccination is the cornerstone of flu prevention. The CDC recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive an annual flu shot, which significantly reduces the risk of illness, severe complications, and hospitalization.\\n\\n### Additional preventive measures include:\\n- **Hand washing**: Regular washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.\\n- **Avoiding face touching**: Keeping hands away from the eyes, nose, and mouth.\\n- **Covering coughs and sneezes**: Using tissues or elbows to minimize the spread of droplets.\\n- **Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces**: This reduces the chance of contamination.\\n- **Staying home when unwell**: This is crucial to prevent spreading the virus to others.\\n\\n## 7. Treatment of Influenza\\nMost flu cases can be treated at home with rest and fluids; however, antiviral medications can be effective if taken within the first two days of symptom onset. These medications can shorten the duration of illness and help prevent complications.\\n\\n**Emergency symptoms** that necessitate immediate medical attention include:\\n- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\\n- Chest pain or pressure.\\n- Confusion or dizziness.\\n- Severe dehydration or persistent worsening symptoms.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines and being aware of influenza's symptoms and transmission, individuals can play an essential role in reducing the incidence and severity of the flu during outbreak seasons.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"tasks_output\": [{\"description\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Influenza (Flu) Make sure you find any relevant information of renowned sources.\\n\", \"name\": \"research_task\", \"expected_output\": \"A set of relevant information about Influenza (Flu)\\n\", \"summary\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Influenza (Flu) Make sure you...\", \"raw\": \"Influenza (Flu) Overview:\\nInfluenza, commonly referred to as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs.

Overview of Influenza\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect the nose, throat, and lungs. The flu is characterized by its sudden onset and can lead to mild to severe illness. In some cases, it can result in death, especially among high-risk groups. The flu typically circulates in seasonal epidemics, with a usual peak from October to May in North America. \\n\\nThe best method to mitigate the impacts of seasonal flu is through annual vaccination, which helps protect against the strains of the virus expected to be most prevalent in the upcoming season.\\n\\n## 2. Symptoms of Influenza\\nFlu symptoms often appear suddenly and can include the following:\\n- **Fever or chills**: Many affected individuals may experience a fever, although not everyone will have one.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent cough is common.\\n- **Sore throat**: Soreness in the throat is frequently reported.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: This may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Muscle or body aches**: General discomfort and bodily pain are common.\\n- **Headaches**: Headaches can be a significant symptom.\\n- **Fatigue (tiredness)**: Many individuals report extreme fatigue with the flu.\\n- **Sweating and chills**: Sweating, coupled with chills, is often seen.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms such as ear pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may occur more frequently than in adults.\\n\\n## 3. How Influenza Spreads\\nThe flu virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also be contracted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Notably, individuals can begin spreading the virus to others approximately one day before symptoms appear and can continue to do so for 5-7 days after becoming sick.\\n\\n## 4. Risk Factors for Complications\\nCertain populations are at greater risk for severe flu complications:\\n- **Young children**, especially those under 2 years old.\\n- **Elderly adults**, particularly those over 65 years old.\\n- Individuals with **weakened immune systems**.\\n- **Pregnant women**.\\n- People with **chronic medical conditions** such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.\\n\\n## 5. Complications from the Flu\\nWhile many healthy individuals will recover within a week, the flu can pose significant complications for high-risk groups. Possible complications include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: A severe respiratory infection that can be life-threatening.\\n- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: A serious condition affecting breathing.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health issues**: Conditions such as asthma or heart disease can worsen following a flu infection.\\n- **Secondary bacterial infections**: To include sinus and ear infections.\\n- **Sepsis or toxic shock syndrome**: These serious conditions can also arise from influenza infection.\\n\\n## 6.

This reaction leads to symptoms that resemble a cold, such as sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, itchy eyes, and sinus discomfort. Common triggers for hay fever include pollen from trees, grass, pet fur, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nPeople with hay fever may experience several symptoms, which can significantly disrupt daily life. These include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A rapid expulsion of air from the nose that occurs due to nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny Nose**: Often produces clear mucus.\\n- **Nasal Congestion**: Difficulty breathing through the nose due to swelling and inflammation.\\n- **Itchy Eyes/Nose/Throat**: Leads to discomfort and redness, often associated with swelling.\\n- **Watery Eyes**: Increased tearing as a response to allergens.\\n- **Postnasal Drip**: Mucus accumulation in the throat, leading to coughing, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Often results from poor sleep quality when nasal passages are congested.\\n\\nThe severity and timing of these symptoms can differ based on individual reactions and the presence of specific allergens throughout different seasons.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by several allergens which can be categorized into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: \\n  - **Tree Pollen**: Common in spring.\\n  - **Grass Pollen**: Peaks in summer.\\n  - **Ragweed Pollen**: Found in late summer and fall.\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: \\n  - **Dust Mites**: Tiny creatures that thrive in household dust.\\n  - **Pet Dander**: Flecks of skin shed by furry pets.\\n  - **Cockroach Droppings**: Waste matter from cockroaches.\\n  - **Mold Spores**: Produced by mold, especially in damp conditions.\\n- **Irritants**: Such as cigarette smoke, strong smells (like perfume), cleaning products, and pollution may cause or exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and avoiding these triggers is essential for effective management of hay fever.\\n\\n## Causes\\nHay fever happens when the immune system mistakenly perceives normally harmless substances as dangerous. This leads to the production of specific antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). When these antibodies meet the allergens, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which is responsible for most of the allergic symptoms.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally requires:\\n- A thorough discussion of the patient's medical history and current symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests (such as skin prick tests or blood tests) to pinpoint specific allergens.\\n- Assessments for any related complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nAccurate diagnosis is crucial to determining the most effective treatment plan.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe first step for managing hay fever is to minimize contact with known allergens:\\n- **Keep Windows Closed**: During high pollen seasons.\\n- **Use Air Conditioning**: Helps filter out allergens.\\n- **Wear Sunglasses**: Outdoors to shield eyes from pollen.\\n- **Limit Indoor Exposure**: Keep pets out of sleeping areas and frequently clean to reduce allergen accumulation.\\n\\n### 2. Medications\\nDifferent types of medications can be used to relieve symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Alleviate sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Available in pills and nasal spray forms.\\n- **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n- **Decongestants**: Reduce stuffiness but should be taken only short-term due to potential side effects.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block allergic reaction-triggering substances in the body.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Involves gradually introducing allergens to build tolerance, offered through allergy shots or oral tablets.\\n\\n### 3. Non-Medication Strategies\\nAdditional strategies to help manage symptoms include:\\n- **Nasal Saline Rinses**: Clear nasal passages of allergens.\\n- **HEPA Filters**: Use in home air systems to trap particles.\\n- **Regular Cleaning**: Wash bedding and clothes in hot water to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n## Complications\\nIf left untreated, hay fever can lead to several issues:\\n- **Poor Sleep Quality**: Resulting in daytime fatigue and decreased productivity.\\n- **Increased Risk of Asthma**: May develop alongside other allergic conditions.\\n- **Sinusitis or Ear Infections**: More common in children with untreated hay fever.\\n\\n## When to See a Doctor\\nIt is recommended to see a healthcare professional when:\\n- Symptoms greatly interfere with daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about potential complications like asthma.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever is a widespread yet manageable condition with various treatment options available. A personalized management plan, often developed with the help of an allergist, can significantly improve symptoms and overall well-being.

Common triggers for hay fever include pollen from trees, grass, pet fur, mold spores, and dust mites.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nPeople with hay fever may experience several symptoms, which can significantly disrupt daily life. These include:\\n- **Sneezing**: A rapid expulsion of air from the nose that occurs due to nasal irritation.\\n- **Runny Nose**: Often produces clear mucus.\\n- **Nasal Congestion**: Difficulty breathing through the nose due to swelling and inflammation.\\n- **Itchy Eyes/Nose/Throat**: Leads to discomfort and redness, often associated with swelling.\\n- **Watery Eyes**: Increased tearing as a response to allergens.\\n- **Postnasal Drip**: Mucus accumulation in the throat, leading to coughing, particularly at night.\\n- **Fatigue**: Often results from poor sleep quality when nasal passages are congested.\\n\\nThe severity and timing of these symptoms can differ based on individual reactions and the presence of specific allergens throughout different seasons.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever can be triggered by several allergens which can be categorized into:\\n- **Seasonal Allergens**: \\n  - **Tree Pollen**: Common in spring.\\n  - **Grass Pollen**: Peaks in summer.\\n  - **Ragweed Pollen**: Found in late summer and fall.\\n- **Perennial Allergens**: \\n  - **Dust Mites**: Tiny creatures that thrive in household dust.\\n  - **Pet Dander**: Flecks of skin shed by furry pets.\\n  - **Cockroach Droppings**: Waste matter from cockroaches.\\n  - **Mold Spores**: Produced by mold, especially in damp conditions.\\n- **Irritants**: Such as cigarette smoke, strong smells (like perfume), cleaning products, and pollution may cause or exacerbate symptoms.\\n\\nIdentifying and avoiding these triggers is essential for effective management of hay fever.\\n\\n## Causes\\nHay fever happens when the immune system mistakenly perceives normally harmless substances as dangerous. This leads to the production of specific antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). When these antibodies meet the allergens, they trigger the release of chemicals like histamine, which is responsible for most of the allergic symptoms.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing hay fever generally requires:\\n- A thorough discussion of the patient's medical history and current symptoms.\\n- Allergy tests (such as skin prick tests or blood tests) to pinpoint specific allergens.\\n- Assessments for any related complications, such as asthma or nasal polyps.\\n\\nAccurate diagnosis is crucial to determining the most effective treatment plan.\\n\\n## Management and Treatment\\n### 1. Avoiding Allergens\\nThe first step for managing hay fever is to minimize contact with known allergens:\\n- **Keep Windows Closed**: During high pollen seasons.\\n- **Use Air Conditioning**: Helps filter out allergens.\\n- **Wear Sunglasses**: Outdoors to shield eyes from pollen.\\n- **Limit Indoor Exposure**: Keep pets out of sleeping areas and frequently clean to reduce allergen accumulation.\\n\\n### 2. Medications\\nDifferent types of medications can be used to relieve symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Alleviate sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Available in pills and nasal spray forms.\\n- **Intranasal Corticosteroids**: Effective in reducing inflammation and nasal congestion.\\n- **Decongestants**: Reduce stuffiness but should be taken only short-term due to potential side effects.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Block allergic reaction-triggering substances in the body.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Involves gradually introducing allergens to build tolerance, offered through allergy shots or oral tablets.\\n\\n### 3. Non-Medication Strategies\\nAdditional strategies to help manage symptoms include:\\n- **Nasal Saline Rinses**: Clear nasal passages of allergens.\\n- **HEPA Filters**: Use in home air systems to trap particles.\\n- **Regular Cleaning**: Wash bedding and clothes in hot water to eliminate dust mites and mold.\\n\\n## Complications\\nIf left untreated, hay fever can lead to several issues:\\n- **Poor Sleep Quality**: Resulting in daytime fatigue and decreased productivity.\\n- **Increased Risk of Asthma**: May develop alongside other allergic conditions.\\n- **Sinusitis or Ear Infections**: More common in children with untreated hay fever.\\n\\n## When to See a Doctor\\nIt is recommended to see a healthcare professional when:\\n- Symptoms greatly interfere with daily life.\\n- Over-the-counter medications are ineffective.\\n- There are concerns about potential complications like asthma.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever is a widespread yet manageable condition with various treatment options available. A personalized management plan, often developed with the help of an allergist, can significantly improve symptoms and overall well-being. Awareness of triggers and treatment strategies is vital for effective control of hay fever.\\n\\n## Sources\\n- Cleveland Clinic [Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever): Symptoms & Treatment](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- Mayo Clinic [Hay fever - Symptoms and causes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- ACAAI [Hay Fever (Rhinitis) | Symptoms & Treatment](https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/hay-fever/)\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis) Senior Summarizer\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}], \"token_usage\": {\"total_tokens\": 63234, \"prompt_tokens\": 58685, \"cached_prompt_tokens\": 10752, \"completion_tokens\": 4549, \"successful_requests\": 10}}, {\"raw\": \"# Comprehensive Report on Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)\\n\\n## Overview\\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) occur when bacteria invade parts of the urinary system, which includes:\\n- **Kidneys**\\n- **Ureters** (tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder)\\n- **Bladder**\\n- **Urethra** (the tube through which urine exits the body)\\n\\nMost infections affect the lower urinary tract, especially the bladder and urethra.

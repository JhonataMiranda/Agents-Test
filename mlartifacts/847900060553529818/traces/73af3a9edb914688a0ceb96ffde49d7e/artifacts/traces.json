Over 200 different viruses can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most frequently responsible. This illness is widespread and is one of the top reasons for missing school and work.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically include:\\n\\n1. **Runny or Stuffy Nose**: This is often the first symptom to show and can be quite annoying, making it hard to breathe through the nose.\\n2. **Sore Throat**: This can range from a scratchy feeling to very painful.\\n3. **Cough**: Usually starts as a dry cough but can later lead to mucus production.\\n4. **Sneezing**: Commonly occurs, especially early in the illness.\\n5. **Headache**: This can vary in intensity, from mild to severe enough to disrupt activities.\\n6. **Mild Body Aches**: General discomfort or soreness in the body.\\n7. **Low-Grade Fever**: Sometimes, especially in children, a mild fever may occur.\\n\\nThese symptoms typically appear 1 to 3 days after being exposed to the virus and usually last for less than a week.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nColds are very contagious and can easily spread through several ways:\\n- **Airborne Droplets**: When someone coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the virus can travel through the air and be inhaled by others nearby.\\n- **Hand-to-Hand Contact**: The virus can spread from an object or surface to hands, and then into the nose or mouth.\\n- **Shared Objects**: Items that are frequently touched, such as utensils, toys, or doorknobs, can also carry the virus.\\n\\nThe time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms (incubation period) is generally 12 hours to three days, and a person can be contagious for up to two weeks.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nSome people are at a higher risk of getting colds:\\n- **Age**: Young children, particularly those in daycare or school, are more likely to catch colds.\\n- **Weakened Immune System**: Individuals with chronic illnesses or weakened immune systems are more vulnerable.\\n- **Close Contact**: Spending time near other people, especially in crowded places, increases risk.\\n- **Smoking and Exposure to Secondhand Smoke**: This can irritate the respiratory system and increase vulnerability to infections.\\n\\n## Complications\\nAlthough most colds are mild, they can lead to more serious complications in certain individuals:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Children may develop fluid buildup in their ears, leading to infections.\\n- **Sinusitis**: This condition involves inflammation or infection of the sinuses that can occur after a cold.\\n- **Asthma Attacks**: Those with asthma may experience worsened symptoms.\\n- **Pneumonia**: In rare cases, especially in older adults or people with pre-existing health issues, a cold can lead to pneumonia.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nHealthcare providers usually diagnose the common cold based on symptoms and a physical examination. There is no specific cure for the cold; treatments focus on alleviating symptoms, which may include:\\n- **Over-the-Counter Medications**: Pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for alleviating pain, decongestants to relieve nasal congestion, and antihistamines to reduce runny noses.\\n- **Hydration and Rest**: Drinking plenty of fluids and getting enough sleep are crucial for recovery.\\n\\nAntibiotics do not work on viruses and should not be given for colds.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo reduce the chances of getting or spreading a cold, it's helpful to:\\n- **Wash Hands Often**: Especially after using the restroom or before eating—wash for at least 20 seconds.\\n- **Avoid Close Contact with Sick People**: Keeping distance can lower exposure risks.\\n- **Disinfect Frequently Touched Surfaces**: Cleaning common areas often can help decrease the presence of viruses.\\n- **Use Hand Sanitizers**: When soap and water are unavailable, sanitizers are a good alternative.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nAlthough the common cold is usually not serious, it can lead to significant health issues in some populations.

The illness can manifest in various forms, ranging from mild to severe and poses a significant risk to people with underlying health conditions, the elderly, and young children. The virus is responsible for seasonal epidemics that can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality rates globally.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of influenza typically begin suddenly and may include:\\n- **Fever**: A high fever often accompanies the flu, generally lasting 3 to 4 days.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent dry cough that can worsen with intensity.\\n- **Sore throat**: Inflammation of the throat can lead to pain while swallowing.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: Congestion can make breathing difficult.\\n- **Body aches**: Common muscular aches can lead to fatigue.\\n- **Headaches**: Frequent and intense headaches are often reported.\\n- **Chills and fatigue**: Accompany flu symptoms, causing exhaustion.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms may include vomiting and diarrhea, which are less common in adults. The variations in symptoms can be attributed to the individual’s health and age, as well as the specific strain of the virus.\\n\\n## Causes\\nThere are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Types A and B are responsible for most seasonal flu outbreaks. Influenza A viruses mutate rapidly, which can lead to significant changes in the virus, accounting for pandemic strains. Influenza B typically causes seasonal epidemics and is generally less severe than type A. Type C causes mild respiratory illness, while type D primarily affects cattle and is not known to infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads through droplets made when people with the flu cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention is critical in controlling flu outbreaks. Key methods include:\\n- **Annual vaccination**: Getting vaccinated each year is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications. Vaccines are reviewed and updated annually to target the most prevalent strains.\\n- **Good health practices**: Regular hand washing, using hand sanitizers, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when ill can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.\\n\\n## Treatment and Diagnosis\\nMost individuals recover from the flu without medical intervention; however, antiviral medications may be prescribed to shorten the duration of the illness or to prevent complications in high-risk patients. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical symptoms but can be confirmed using rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs).\\n\\n### Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to severe complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Some of the common complications include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: Inflammation of the lungs can occur, requiring hospitalization.\\n- **Bronchitis and sinus infections**: Infections in the airways can lead to further medical issues.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health problems**: Individuals with chronic conditions like asthma or heart disease may experience exacerbated symptoms.\\n\\n## Surveillance and Public Health Impact\\nMonitoring influenza activity is crucial for public health officials to manage outbreaks.

It occurs when the immune system overreacts to inhaled allergens present in the environment. Despite its name, hay fever is not caused by hay, nor does it typically involve a fever. Rather, it is a reaction to tiny particles known as allergens, which can include pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and insect particles.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can vary in severity and include:\\n- **Sneezing**\\n- **Nasal congestion and runny nose**\\n- **Itchy eyes, nose, or throat**\\n- **Red or watery eyes**\\n- **Headaches and sinus pressure**\\n- **Fatigue and tiredness**\\n- **Sore throat from postnasal drip**\\n- **Wheezing or coughing**\\n\\nThese symptoms can occur year-round or seasonally, depending on the individual's triggers.

The most commonly affected areas are the bladder (called cystitis) and the urethra (referred to as urethritis). The primary cause of these infections is the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli), typically found in the colon. Infections can lead to inflammation of the urinary tract lining, and if left untreated, may spread to the kidneys, causing severe complications like pyelonephritis.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of UTIs often include:\\n- A strong, persistent urge to urinate\\n- A burning sensation during urination\\n- Frequent urination in small amounts\\n- Pain or discomfort in the pelvic or lower abdominal area\\n- Changes in urine color (such as dark, cloudy, or reddish)\\n- Fever and chills, which indicate the infection may have reached the kidneys\\n\\nThese symptoms can vary based on whether the infection affects the lower or upper urinary tract.\\n\\n## Risk Factors and Anatomical Considerations\\n\\nUTIs are more common in females due to anatomical reasons; women have a shorter urethra, which allows bacteria to enter the bladder more easily. Other risk factors include:\\n- Sexual activity, which can introduce bacteria into the urethra\\n- Certain birth control methods, such as diaphragms\\n- Menopause, leading to hormonal changes that increase UTI risks\\n- A history of urinary tract infections\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\n\\nDiagnosing a UTI usually involves a urinalysis, which tests a urine sample for bacteria, blood, or pus. A urine culture may also be performed to identify the specific type of bacteria causing the infection, which helps in selecting effective antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n## Treatment\\n\\nThe standard treatment for UTIs consists of antibiotics effective against the identified bacteria. Common antibiotics used include:\\n- Nitrofurantoin\\n- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\\n- Fosfomycin\\n\\nThe treatment course typically lasts between 3 to 7 days, depending on the severity of the infection.\\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\n\\nTo reduce the likelihood of recurrent infections, preventive measures are crucial. Key recommendations include:\\n- Drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated and help flush out bacteria from the urinary tract\\n- Urinating after sexual intercourse to remove potential bacteria\\n- Practicing good personal hygiene, such as wiping from front to back after using the restroom\\n- Avoiding bladder irritants like caffeine, alcohol, and citrus juices\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nIf not treated, UTIs can lead to serious complications, such as recurrent infections and permanent kidney damage. In elderly individuals, UTIs may present differently, often showing as confusion or changes in mental status rather than typical urinary symptoms.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUrinary Tract Infections are a common yet serious health issue, especially affecting women due to anatomical factors. Understanding the causes, symptoms, and risk factors associated with UTIs is essential for early diagnosis and effective treatment.

Over 200 different viruses can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most frequently responsible. This illness is widespread and is one of the top reasons for missing school and work.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically include:\\n\\n1. **Runny or Stuffy Nose**: This is often the first symptom to show and can be quite annoying, making it hard to breathe through the nose.\\n2. **Sore Throat**: This can range from a scratchy feeling to very painful.\\n3. **Cough**: Usually starts as a dry cough but can later lead to mucus production.\\n4. **Sneezing**: Commonly occurs, especially early in the illness.\\n5. **Headache**: This can vary in intensity, from mild to severe enough to disrupt activities.\\n6. **Mild Body Aches**: General discomfort or soreness in the body.\\n7. **Low-Grade Fever**: Sometimes, especially in children, a mild fever may occur.\\n\\nThese symptoms typically appear 1 to 3 days after being exposed to the virus and usually last for less than a week.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nColds are very contagious and can easily spread through several ways:\\n- **Airborne Droplets**: When someone coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the virus can travel through the air and be inhaled by others nearby.\\n- **Hand-to-Hand Contact**: The virus can spread from an object or surface to hands, and then into the nose or mouth.\\n- **Shared Objects**: Items that are frequently touched, such as utensils, toys, or doorknobs, can also carry the virus.\\n\\nThe time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms (incubation period) is generally 12 hours to three days, and a person can be contagious for up to two weeks.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nSome people are at a higher risk of getting colds:\\n- **Age**: Young children, particularly those in daycare or school, are more likely to catch colds.\\n- **Weakened Immune System**: Individuals with chronic illnesses or weakened immune systems are more vulnerable.\\n- **Close Contact**: Spending time near other people, especially in crowded places, increases risk.\\n- **Smoking and Exposure to Secondhand Smoke**: This can irritate the respiratory system and increase vulnerability to infections.\\n\\n## Complications\\nAlthough most colds are mild, they can lead to more serious complications in certain individuals:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Children may develop fluid buildup in their ears, leading to infections.\\n- **Sinusitis**: This condition involves inflammation or infection of the sinuses that can occur after a cold.\\n- **Asthma Attacks**: Those with asthma may experience worsened symptoms.\\n- **Pneumonia**: In rare cases, especially in older adults or people with pre-existing health issues, a cold can lead to pneumonia.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nHealthcare providers usually diagnose the common cold based on symptoms and a physical examination. There is no specific cure for the cold; treatments focus on alleviating symptoms, which may include:\\n- **Over-the-Counter Medications**: Pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for alleviating pain, decongestants to relieve nasal congestion, and antihistamines to reduce runny noses.\\n- **Hydration and Rest**: Drinking plenty of fluids and getting enough sleep are crucial for recovery.\\n\\nAntibiotics do not work on viruses and should not be given for colds.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo reduce the chances of getting or spreading a cold, it's helpful to:\\n- **Wash Hands Often**: Especially after using the restroom or before eating—wash for at least 20 seconds.\\n- **Avoid Close Contact with Sick People**: Keeping distance can lower exposure risks.\\n- **Disinfect Frequently Touched Surfaces**: Cleaning common areas often can help decrease the presence of viruses.\\n- **Use Hand Sanitizers**: When soap and water are unavailable, sanitizers are a good alternative.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nAlthough the common cold is usually not serious, it can lead to significant health issues in some populations.

There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. This illness is highly prevalent and is considered one of the leading causes of missed school and workdays.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe hallmark symptoms of a common cold include:\\n\\n1. **Runny or Stuffy Nose**: Often the first to occur, nasal congestion can be bothersome and limits airflow.\\n2. **Sore Throat**: Caused by irritation of the throat, this symptom can vary from mild to very painful.\\n3. **Cough**: Typically a dry cough initially that may later produce mucus.\\n4. **Sneezing**: Frequently occurs, especially early during the infection.\\n5. **Headache**: Can be a minor annoyance or severe enough to affect daily activities.\\n6. **Mild Body Aches**: General feelings of discomfort and muscle pain.\\n7. **Low-Grade Fever**: In some cases, especially among children, a mild fever may develop.\\n\\nSymptoms generally appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and usually last less than a week.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and can spread easily through several mechanisms:\\n- **Airborne Droplets**: Coughing and sneezing release droplets into the air, which can be inhaled by others nearby.\\n- **Hand-to-Hand Contact**: Viruses can be transferred from contaminated surfaces or objects to hands, then to the nose or mouth.\\n- **Shared Objects**: Commonly touched items like utensils, toys, and doorknobs can harbor viruses.\\n\\nThe incubation period for a cold ranges from 12 hours to three days after exposure, and individuals can remain contagious for up to two weeks.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nCertain individuals may have an increased risk of contracting colds:\\n- **Age**: Young children, especially those in group settings, are more susceptible.\\n- **Weakened Immune System**: Individuals with chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems are more likely to catch colds.\\n- **Close Contact**: Being in close proximity to others, such as in schools or daycare settings, increases exposure risk.\\n- **Smoking and Secondhand Smoke Exposure**: Both can irritate the respiratory tract, making individuals more susceptible to infections.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile the common cold is usually mild, it can lead to more serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Possible complications include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children, fluid can accumulate in the ear, leading to infections.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation or infection of the sinuses can occur after a cold.\\n- **Asthma Attacks**: Individuals with asthma may experience exacerbated symptoms.\\n- **Pneumonia**: Rarely, a cold can lead to pneumonia, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing health issues.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nDiagnosis of the common cold typically relies on a review of symptoms and physical examination through a healthcare provider. There is no specific cure for colds; treatment is oriented towards symptom relief, which may include:\\n- **Over-the-Counter Medications**: Analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief, decongestants for nasal blockage, and antihistamines for runny noses.\\n- **Hydration and Rest**: Essential for recovery, adequate fluid intake and sleep help the body fight the virus.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viruses and should not be used for colds.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo minimize the risk of contracting or spreading the common cold, individuals are encouraged to:\\n- **Wash Hands Frequently**: Especially after using the restroom or before eating, for at least 20 seconds.\\n- **Avoid Close Contact with Sick Individuals**: Maintain distance to reduce exposure.\\n- **Disinfect Frequently Touched Surfaces**: Regular cleaning can help reduce the presence of viruses on surfaces.\\n- **Use Hand Sanitizers**: Particularly when soap and water are unavailable.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe common cold, while generally harmless, poses risks for severe complications in susceptible individuals. Most cases resolve within a week without intervention.

It is caused by over 200 different viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common culprit.\\n\\n**Symptoms:**\\n1. Runny or stuffy nose\\n2. Sore throat\\n3. Cough\\n4. Sneezing\\n5. Headache\\n6. Mild body aches\\n7. Low-grade fever\\nSymptoms usually appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and typically last less than a week.\\n\\n**Transmission:**\\nColds are contagious and spread easily through:\\n- Airborne droplets from a cough or sneeze.\\n- Hand-to-hand contact.\\n- Shared objects, such as utensils and toys.\\n\\nThe incubation period ranges from 12 hours to three days, and individuals can be contagious for up to two weeks.\\n\\n**Risk Factors:**\\n- Age (children are at a higher risk)\\n- Weakened immune system\\n- Close contact with others (such as in childcare settings)\\n- Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke\\n\\n**Complications:**\\nComplications can arise from respiratory infections, including:\\n- Middle ear infections\\n- Sinusitis\\n- Asthma attacks\\n- In some cases, pneumonia\\n\\n**Diagnosis and Treatment:**\\nDiagnosis is generally based on symptoms and physical examination. There is no cure for the common cold, and treatments focus on symptom relief via:\\n- Over-the-counter medications (i.e., pain relievers, decongestants, antihistamines).\\n- Hydration and rest.\\nAntibiotics are ineffective as colds are caused by viruses, not bacteria.\\n\\n**Prevention:**\\nTo reduce the risk of contracting or spreading a cold:\\n- Wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds.\\n- Avoid close contact with sick individuals.\\n- Disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\\n- Use hand sanitizers when soap is not available.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nWhile usually harmless, the common cold can lead to more severe health issues in susceptible individuals. Most colds resolve on their own within a week. If symptoms worsen or persist beyond 10 days, medical consultation is advised.\\n```\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_1", "context": {"span_id": "0x87421c755a6b2556", "trace_id": "0x1fc17f50d206d076e8961c4a66afa121"}, "parent_id": "0x54474bc076a249dc", "start_time": 1742218498817847027, "end_time": 1742218501560678346, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"73af3a9edb914688a0ceb96ffde49d7e\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Common Cold Senior Data Researcher\\n.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia.

Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

The virus can spread by:\\nDroplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.\\nHand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.\\nSharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.\\nTouching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.\\nRisk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:\\nAge. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\\nCover your cough. Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.\\nDon't share. Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.\\nStay away from people with colds. Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.\\nReview your child care center's policies. Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.\\nTake care of yourself.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Most often, it's harmless, but it might not feel that way. Germs called viruses cause a common cold.\\nOften, adults may have two or three colds each year. Infants and young children may have colds more often.\\nMost people recover from a common cold in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. If symptoms don't get better or if they get worse, see your health care provider.\\nIllnesses of the nose and throat caused by germs are called upper respiratory tract infections.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms Most often, common cold symptoms start 1 to 3 days after someone is exposed to a cold virus. Symptoms vary. They can include:\\nRunny or stuffy nose.\\nSore or scratchy throat.\\nCough.\\nSneezing.\\nGenerally feeling unwell.\\nSlight body aches or a mild headache.\\nLow-grade fever.\\nThe mucus from your nose may start out clear and become thicker and yellow or green. This change is normal. Most often, it doesn't mean that you have a bacterial illness.\\nWhen to see a doctor For adults. Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. But see your health care provider if you have:\\nSymptoms that get worse or do not get better.\\nFever greater than 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit (38.5 degrees Celsius) that lasts more than three days.\\nFever returning after a fever-free period.\\nShortness of breath.\\nWheezing.\\nIntense sore throat, headache or sinus pain.\\nFor children.

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.\\nA cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by:\\nDroplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.\\nHand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.\\nSharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.\\nTouching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.\\nRisk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:\\nAge. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\\nCover your cough. Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.\\nDon't share. Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.\\nStay away from people with colds. Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.\\nReview your child care center's policies. Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.\\nTake care of yourself. Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nMay 24, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nAAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:\\nRunny nose or nasal congestion\\nCough\\nSneezing\\nSore throat\\nHeadache\\nMild body aches\\nFever (usually low grade in older children and adults)\\nComplications\\nComplications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:\\nMild to moderate:\\nMiddle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)\\nSinus infections\\nPotentially severe:\\nAsthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)\\nBronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)\\nBronchitis (infection of the large airways)\\nPneumonia (infection of the lungs)\\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)\\nSome respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness . This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.\\nCauses and spread\\nCauses\\nMore than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses , adenoviruses , enteroviruses (including EV-D68 ), and human metapneumovirus .\\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested , especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.\\nSpread\\nDifferent respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.\\nYou can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.\\nTip‎\\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold.

Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:\\nRunny nose or nasal congestion\\nCough\\nSneezing\\nSore throat\\nHeadache\\nMild body aches\\nFever (usually low grade in older children and adults)\\nComplications\\nComplications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:\\nMild to moderate:\\nMiddle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)\\nSinus infections\\nPotentially severe:\\nAsthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)\\nBronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)\\nBronchitis (infection of the large airways)\\nPneumonia (infection of the lungs)\\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)\\nSome respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness . This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.\\nCauses and spread\\nCauses\\nMore than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses , adenoviruses , enteroviruses (including EV-D68 ), and human metapneumovirus .\\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested , especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.\\nSpread\\nDifferent respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.\\nYou can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.\\nTip‎\\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.\\nA cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by:\\nDroplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.\\nHand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.\\nSharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.\\nTouching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.\\nRisk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:\\nAge. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\\nCover your cough. Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.\\nDon't share. Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.\\nStay away from people with colds. Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.\\nReview your child care center's policies. Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.\\nTake care of yourself. Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nMay 24, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nAAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:\\nRunny nose or nasal congestion\\nCough\\nSneezing\\nSore throat\\nHeadache\\nMild body aches\\nFever (usually low grade in older children and adults)\\nComplications\\nComplications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:\\nMild to moderate:\\nMiddle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)\\nSinus infections\\nPotentially severe:\\nAsthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)\\nBronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)\\nBronchitis (infection of the large airways)\\nPneumonia (infection of the lungs)\\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)\\nSome respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness . This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.\\nCauses and spread\\nCauses\\nMore than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses , adenoviruses , enteroviruses (including EV-D68 ), and human metapneumovirus .\\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested , especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.\\nSpread\\nDifferent respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.\\nYou can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.\\nTip‎\\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold.

Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:\\nRunny nose or nasal congestion\\nCough\\nSneezing\\nSore throat\\nHeadache\\nMild body aches\\nFever (usually low grade in older children and adults)\\nComplications\\nComplications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:\\nMild to moderate:\\nMiddle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)\\nSinus infections\\nPotentially severe:\\nAsthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)\\nBronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)\\nBronchitis (infection of the large airways)\\nPneumonia (infection of the lungs)\\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)\\nSome respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness . This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.\\nCauses and spread\\nCauses\\nMore than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses , adenoviruses , enteroviruses (including EV-D68 ), and human metapneumovirus .\\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested , especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.\\nSpread\\nDifferent respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.\\nYou can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.\\nTip‎\\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others.

There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. This illness is highly prevalent and is considered one of the leading causes of missed school and workdays.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe hallmark symptoms of a common cold include:\\n\\n1. **Runny or Stuffy Nose**: Often the first to occur, nasal congestion can be bothersome and limits airflow.\\n2. **Sore Throat**: Caused by irritation of the throat, this symptom can vary from mild to very painful.\\n3. **Cough**: Typically a dry cough initially that may later produce mucus.\\n4. **Sneezing**: Frequently occurs, especially early during the infection.\\n5. **Headache**: Can be a minor annoyance or severe enough to affect daily activities.\\n6. **Mild Body Aches**: General feelings of discomfort and muscle pain.\\n7. **Low-Grade Fever**: In some cases, especially among children, a mild fever may develop.\\n\\nSymptoms generally appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and usually last less than a week.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and can spread easily through several mechanisms:\\n- **Airborne Droplets**: Coughing and sneezing release droplets into the air, which can be inhaled by others nearby.\\n- **Hand-to-Hand Contact**: Viruses can be transferred from contaminated surfaces or objects to hands, then to the nose or mouth.\\n- **Shared Objects**: Commonly touched items like utensils, toys, and doorknobs can harbor viruses.\\n\\nThe incubation period for a cold ranges from 12 hours to three days after exposure, and individuals can remain contagious for up to two weeks.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nCertain individuals may have an increased risk of contracting colds:\\n- **Age**: Young children, especially those in group settings, are more susceptible.\\n- **Weakened Immune System**: Individuals with chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems are more likely to catch colds.\\n- **Close Contact**: Being in close proximity to others, such as in schools or daycare settings, increases exposure risk.\\n- **Smoking and Secondhand Smoke Exposure**: Both can irritate the respiratory tract, making individuals more susceptible to infections.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile the common cold is usually mild, it can lead to more serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Possible complications include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children, fluid can accumulate in the ear, leading to infections.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation or infection of the sinuses can occur after a cold.\\n- **Asthma Attacks**: Individuals with asthma may experience exacerbated symptoms.\\n- **Pneumonia**: Rarely, a cold can lead to pneumonia, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing health issues.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nDiagnosis of the common cold typically relies on a review of symptoms and physical examination through a healthcare provider. There is no specific cure for colds; treatment is oriented towards symptom relief, which may include:\\n- **Over-the-Counter Medications**: Analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief, decongestants for nasal blockage, and antihistamines for runny noses.\\n- **Hydration and Rest**: Essential for recovery, adequate fluid intake and sleep help the body fight the virus.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viruses and should not be used for colds.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo minimize the risk of contracting or spreading the common cold, individuals are encouraged to:\\n- **Wash Hands Frequently**: Especially after using the restroom or before eating, for at least 20 seconds.\\n- **Avoid Close Contact with Sick Individuals**: Maintain distance to reduce exposure.\\n- **Disinfect Frequently Touched Surfaces**: Regular cleaning can help reduce the presence of viruses on surfaces.\\n- **Use Hand Sanitizers**: Particularly when soap and water are unavailable.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe common cold, while generally harmless, poses risks for severe complications in susceptible individuals.

There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. This illness is highly prevalent and is considered one of the leading causes of missed school and workdays.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe hallmark symptoms of a common cold include:\\n\\n1. **Runny or Stuffy Nose**: Often the first to occur, nasal congestion can be bothersome and limits airflow.\\n2. **Sore Throat**: Caused by irritation of the throat, this symptom can vary from mild to very painful.\\n3. **Cough**: Typically a dry cough initially that may later produce mucus.\\n4. **Sneezing**: Frequently occurs, especially early during the infection.\\n5. **Headache**: Can be a minor annoyance or severe enough to affect daily activities.\\n6. **Mild Body Aches**: General feelings of discomfort and muscle pain.\\n7. **Low-Grade Fever**: In some cases, especially among children, a mild fever may develop.\\n\\nSymptoms generally appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and usually last less than a week.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and can spread easily through several mechanisms:\\n- **Airborne Droplets**: Coughing and sneezing release droplets into the air, which can be inhaled by others nearby.\\n- **Hand-to-Hand Contact**: Viruses can be transferred from contaminated surfaces or objects to hands, then to the nose or mouth.\\n- **Shared Objects**: Commonly touched items like utensils, toys, and doorknobs can harbor viruses.\\n\\nThe incubation period for a cold ranges from 12 hours to three days after exposure, and individuals can remain contagious for up to two weeks.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nCertain individuals may have an increased risk of contracting colds:\\n- **Age**: Young children, especially those in group settings, are more susceptible.\\n- **Weakened Immune System**: Individuals with chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems are more likely to catch colds.\\n- **Close Contact**: Being in close proximity to others, such as in schools or daycare settings, increases exposure risk.\\n- **Smoking and Secondhand Smoke Exposure**: Both can irritate the respiratory tract, making individuals more susceptible to infections.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile the common cold is usually mild, it can lead to more serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Possible complications include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children, fluid can accumulate in the ear, leading to infections.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation or infection of the sinuses can occur after a cold.\\n- **Asthma Attacks**: Individuals with asthma may experience exacerbated symptoms.\\n- **Pneumonia**: Rarely, a cold can lead to pneumonia, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing health issues.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nDiagnosis of the common cold typically relies on a review of symptoms and physical examination through a healthcare provider. There is no specific cure for colds; treatment is oriented towards symptom relief, which may include:\\n- **Over-the-Counter Medications**: Analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief, decongestants for nasal blockage, and antihistamines for runny noses.\\n- **Hydration and Rest**: Essential for recovery, adequate fluid intake and sleep help the body fight the virus.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viruses and should not be used for colds.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo minimize the risk of contracting or spreading the common cold, individuals are encouraged to:\\n- **Wash Hands Frequently**: Especially after using the restroom or before eating, for at least 20 seconds.\\n- **Avoid Close Contact with Sick Individuals**: Maintain distance to reduce exposure.\\n- **Disinfect Frequently Touched Surfaces**: Regular cleaning can help reduce the presence of viruses on surfaces.\\n- **Use Hand Sanitizers**: Particularly when soap and water are unavailable.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe common cold, while generally harmless, poses risks for severe complications in susceptible individuals. Most cases resolve within a week without intervention. However, if symptoms worsen or last beyond 10 days, it is advisable to seek medical advice to rule out other conditions.\\n```\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_7", "context": {"span_id": "0xe047b3f240c43e48", "trace_id": "0x1fc17f50d206d076e8961c4a66afa121"}, "parent_id": "0x13d841d41de9de15", "start_time": 1742218531742822538, "end_time": 1742218533827119913, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"73af3a9edb914688a0ceb96ffde49d7e\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Common Cold Senior Analyst\\n.

Mild body aches\\n7. Low-grade fever\\nSymptoms usually appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and typically last less than a week.\\n\\n**Transmission:**\\nColds are contagious and spread easily through:\\n- Airborne droplets from a cough or sneeze.\\n- Hand-to-hand contact.\\n- Shared objects, such as utensils and toys.\\n\\nThe incubation period ranges from 12 hours to three days, and individuals can be contagious for up to two weeks.\\n\\n**Risk Factors:**\\n- Age (children are at a higher risk)\\n- Weakened immune system\\n- Close contact with others (such as in childcare settings)\\n- Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke\\n\\n**Complications:**\\nComplications can arise from respiratory infections, including:\\n- Middle ear infections\\n- Sinusitis\\n- Asthma attacks\\n- In some cases, pneumonia\\n\\n**Diagnosis and Treatment:**\\nDiagnosis is generally based on symptoms and physical examination. There is no cure for the common cold, and treatments focus on symptom relief via:\\n- Over-the-counter medications (i.e., pain relievers, decongestants, antihistamines).\\n- Hydration and rest.\\nAntibiotics are ineffective as colds are caused by viruses, not bacteria.\\n\\n**Prevention:**\\nTo reduce the risk of contracting or spreading a cold:\\n- Wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds.\\n- Avoid close contact with sick individuals.\\n- Disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\\n- Use hand sanitizers when soap is not available.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nWhile usually harmless, the common cold can lead to more severe health issues in susceptible individuals. Most colds resolve on their own within a week. If symptoms worsen or persist beyond 10 days, medical consultation is advised.\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. This illness is highly prevalent and is considered one of the leading causes of missed school and workdays.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe hallmark symptoms of a common cold include:\\n\\n1. **Runny or Stuffy Nose**: Often the first to occur, nasal congestion can be bothersome and limits airflow.\\n2. **Sore Throat**: Caused by irritation of the throat, this symptom can vary from mild to very painful.\\n3. **Cough**: Typically a dry cough initially that may later produce mucus.\\n4. **Sneezing**: Frequently occurs, especially early during the infection.\\n5. **Headache**: Can be a minor annoyance or severe enough to affect daily activities.\\n6. **Mild Body Aches**: General feelings of discomfort and muscle pain.\\n7. **Low-Grade Fever**: In some cases, especially among children, a mild fever may develop.\\n\\nSymptoms generally appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and usually last less than a week.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and can spread easily through several mechanisms:\\n- **Airborne Droplets**: Coughing and sneezing release droplets into the air, which can be inhaled by others nearby.\\n- **Hand-to-Hand Contact**: Viruses can be transferred from contaminated surfaces or objects to hands, then to the nose or mouth.\\n- **Shared Objects**: Commonly touched items like utensils, toys, and doorknobs can harbor viruses.\\n\\nThe incubation period for a cold ranges from 12 hours to three days after exposure, and individuals can remain contagious for up to two weeks.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nCertain individuals may have an increased risk of contracting colds:\\n- **Age**: Young children, especially those in group settings, are more susceptible.\\n- **Weakened Immune System**: Individuals with chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems are more likely to catch colds.\\n- **Close Contact**: Being in close proximity to others, such as in schools or daycare settings, increases exposure risk.\\n- **Smoking and Secondhand Smoke Exposure**: Both can irritate the respiratory tract, making individuals more susceptible to infections.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile the common cold is usually mild, it can lead to more serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Possible complications include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children, fluid can accumulate in the ear, leading to infections.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation or infection of the sinuses can occur after a cold.\\n- **Asthma Attacks**: Individuals with asthma may experience exacerbated symptoms.\\n- **Pneumonia**: Rarely, a cold can lead to pneumonia, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing health issues.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nDiagnosis of the common cold typically relies on a review of symptoms and physical examination through a healthcare provider. There is no specific cure for colds; treatment is oriented towards symptom relief, which may include:\\n- **Over-the-Counter Medications**: Analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief, decongestants for nasal blockage, and antihistamines for runny noses.\\n- **Hydration and Rest**: Essential for recovery, adequate fluid intake and sleep help the body fight the virus.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viruses and should not be used for colds.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo minimize the risk of contracting or spreading the common cold, individuals are encouraged to:\\n- **Wash Hands Frequently**: Especially after using the restroom or before eating, for at least 20 seconds.\\n- **Avoid Close Contact with Sick Individuals**: Maintain distance to reduce exposure.\\n- **Disinfect Frequently Touched Surfaces**: Regular cleaning can help reduce the presence of viruses on surfaces.\\n- **Use Hand Sanitizers**: Particularly when soap and water are unavailable.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe common cold, while generally harmless, poses risks for severe complications in susceptible individuals.

There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. This illness is highly prevalent and is considered one of the leading causes of missed school and workdays.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe hallmark symptoms of a common cold include:\\n\\n1. **Runny or Stuffy Nose**: Often the first to occur, nasal congestion can be bothersome and limits airflow.\\n2. **Sore Throat**: Caused by irritation of the throat, this symptom can vary from mild to very painful.\\n3. **Cough**: Typically a dry cough initially that may later produce mucus.\\n4. **Sneezing**: Frequently occurs, especially early during the infection.\\n5. **Headache**: Can be a minor annoyance or severe enough to affect daily activities.\\n6. **Mild Body Aches**: General feelings of discomfort and muscle pain.\\n7. **Low-Grade Fever**: In some cases, especially among children, a mild fever may develop.\\n\\nSymptoms generally appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and usually last less than a week.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and can spread easily through several mechanisms:\\n- **Airborne Droplets**: Coughing and sneezing release droplets into the air, which can be inhaled by others nearby.\\n- **Hand-to-Hand Contact**: Viruses can be transferred from contaminated surfaces or objects to hands, then to the nose or mouth.\\n- **Shared Objects**: Commonly touched items like utensils, toys, and doorknobs can harbor viruses.\\n\\nThe incubation period for a cold ranges from 12 hours to three days after exposure, and individuals can remain contagious for up to two weeks.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nCertain individuals may have an increased risk of contracting colds:\\n- **Age**: Young children, especially those in group settings, are more susceptible.\\n- **Weakened Immune System**: Individuals with chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems are more likely to catch colds.\\n- **Close Contact**: Being in close proximity to others, such as in schools or daycare settings, increases exposure risk.\\n- **Smoking and Secondhand Smoke Exposure**: Both can irritate the respiratory tract, making individuals more susceptible to infections.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile the common cold is usually mild, it can lead to more serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Possible complications include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children, fluid can accumulate in the ear, leading to infections.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation or infection of the sinuses can occur after a cold.\\n- **Asthma Attacks**: Individuals with asthma may experience exacerbated symptoms.\\n- **Pneumonia**: Rarely, a cold can lead to pneumonia, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing health issues.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nDiagnosis of the common cold typically relies on a review of symptoms and physical examination through a healthcare provider. There is no specific cure for colds; treatment is oriented towards symptom relief, which may include:\\n- **Over-the-Counter Medications**: Analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief, decongestants for nasal blockage, and antihistamines for runny noses.\\n- **Hydration and Rest**: Essential for recovery, adequate fluid intake and sleep help the body fight the virus.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viruses and should not be used for colds.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo minimize the risk of contracting or spreading the common cold, individuals are encouraged to:\\n- **Wash Hands Frequently**: Especially after using the restroom or before eating, for at least 20 seconds.\\n- **Avoid Close Contact with Sick Individuals**: Maintain distance to reduce exposure.\\n- **Disinfect Frequently Touched Surfaces**: Regular cleaning can help reduce the presence of viruses on surfaces.\\n- **Use Hand Sanitizers**: Particularly when soap and water are unavailable.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe common cold, while generally harmless, poses risks for severe complications in susceptible individuals. Most cases resolve within a week without intervention.

There are over 200 different viruses that can cause a cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. This illness is highly prevalent and is considered one of the leading causes of missed school and workdays.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe hallmark symptoms of a common cold include:\\n\\n1. **Runny or Stuffy Nose**: Often the first to occur, nasal congestion can be bothersome and limits airflow.\\n2. **Sore Throat**: Caused by irritation of the throat, this symptom can vary from mild to very painful.\\n3. **Cough**: Typically a dry cough initially that may later produce mucus.\\n4. **Sneezing**: Frequently occurs, especially early during the infection.\\n5. **Headache**: Can be a minor annoyance or severe enough to affect daily activities.\\n6. **Mild Body Aches**: General feelings of discomfort and muscle pain.\\n7. **Low-Grade Fever**: In some cases, especially among children, a mild fever may develop.\\n\\nSymptoms generally appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and usually last less than a week.\\n\\n## Transmission\\nColds are highly contagious and can spread easily through several mechanisms:\\n- **Airborne Droplets**: Coughing and sneezing release droplets into the air, which can be inhaled by others nearby.\\n- **Hand-to-Hand Contact**: Viruses can be transferred from contaminated surfaces or objects to hands, then to the nose or mouth.\\n- **Shared Objects**: Commonly touched items like utensils, toys, and doorknobs can harbor viruses.\\n\\nThe incubation period for a cold ranges from 12 hours to three days after exposure, and individuals can remain contagious for up to two weeks.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nCertain individuals may have an increased risk of contracting colds:\\n- **Age**: Young children, especially those in group settings, are more susceptible.\\n- **Weakened Immune System**: Individuals with chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems are more likely to catch colds.\\n- **Close Contact**: Being in close proximity to others, such as in schools or daycare settings, increases exposure risk.\\n- **Smoking and Secondhand Smoke Exposure**: Both can irritate the respiratory tract, making individuals more susceptible to infections.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile the common cold is usually mild, it can lead to more serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Possible complications include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections**: Particularly in children, fluid can accumulate in the ear, leading to infections.\\n- **Sinusitis**: Inflammation or infection of the sinuses can occur after a cold.\\n- **Asthma Attacks**: Individuals with asthma may experience exacerbated symptoms.\\n- **Pneumonia**: Rarely, a cold can lead to pneumonia, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing health issues.\\n\\n## Diagnosis and Treatment\\nDiagnosis of the common cold typically relies on a review of symptoms and physical examination through a healthcare provider. There is no specific cure for colds; treatment is oriented towards symptom relief, which may include:\\n- **Over-the-Counter Medications**: Analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief, decongestants for nasal blockage, and antihistamines for runny noses.\\n- **Hydration and Rest**: Essential for recovery, adequate fluid intake and sleep help the body fight the virus.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viruses and should not be used for colds.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo minimize the risk of contracting or spreading the common cold, individuals are encouraged to:\\n- **Wash Hands Frequently**: Especially after using the restroom or before eating, for at least 20 seconds.\\n- **Avoid Close Contact with Sick Individuals**: Maintain distance to reduce exposure.\\n- **Disinfect Frequently Touched Surfaces**: Regular cleaning can help reduce the presence of viruses on surfaces.\\n- **Use Hand Sanitizers**: Particularly when soap and water are unavailable.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe common cold, while generally harmless, poses risks for severe complications in susceptible individuals.

The illness can manifest in various forms, ranging from mild to severe and poses a significant risk to people with underlying health conditions, the elderly, and young children. The virus is responsible for seasonal epidemics that can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality rates globally.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of influenza typically begin suddenly and may include:\\n- **Fever**: A high fever often accompanies the flu, generally lasting 3 to 4 days.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent dry cough that can worsen with intensity.\\n- **Sore throat**: Inflammation of the throat can lead to pain while swallowing.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: Congestion can make breathing difficult.\\n- **Body aches**: Common muscular aches can lead to fatigue.\\n- **Headaches**: Frequent and intense headaches are often reported.\\n- **Chills and fatigue**: Accompany flu symptoms, causing exhaustion.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms may include vomiting and diarrhea, which are less common in adults. The variations in symptoms can be attributed to the individual’s health and age, as well as the specific strain of the virus.\\n\\n## Causes\\nThere are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Types A and B are responsible for most seasonal flu outbreaks. Influenza A viruses mutate rapidly, which can lead to significant changes in the virus, accounting for pandemic strains. Influenza B typically causes seasonal epidemics and is generally less severe than type A. Type C causes mild respiratory illness, while type D primarily affects cattle and is not known to infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads through droplets made when people with the flu cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention is critical in controlling flu outbreaks. Key methods include:\\n- **Annual vaccination**: Getting vaccinated each year is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications. Vaccines are reviewed and updated annually to target the most prevalent strains.\\n- **Good health practices**: Regular hand washing, using hand sanitizers, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when ill can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.\\n\\n## Treatment and Diagnosis\\nMost individuals recover from the flu without medical intervention; however, antiviral medications may be prescribed to shorten the duration of the illness or to prevent complications in high-risk patients. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical symptoms but can be confirmed using rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs).\\n\\n### Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to severe complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Some of the common complications include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: Inflammation of the lungs can occur, requiring hospitalization.\\n- **Bronchitis and sinus infections**: Infections in the airways can lead to further medical issues.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health problems**: Individuals with chronic conditions like asthma or heart disease may experience exacerbated symptoms.\\n\\n## Surveillance and Public Health Impact\\nMonitoring influenza activity is crucial for public health officials to manage outbreaks. Surveillance systems track the prevalence of the virus and its strains to inform vaccination strategies and public health responses.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nInfluenza is a serious public health concern that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Understanding its symptoms, causes, prevention strategies, and treatment can help mitigate the impact of the flu, especially during peak influenza seasons. Public awareness, healthy practices, and vaccination are vital in the ongoing fight against influenza infections. \\n\\nFor further information, visit [CDC Flu Overview](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/index.html), [Mayo Clinic Flu Symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719), [Cleveland Clinic on Influenza](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4335-influenza-flu), and [Illinois Department of Public Health Influenza](https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/respiratory-disease/diseases/influenza.html).\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"tasks_output\": [{\"description\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Influenza (Flu) Make sure you find any relevant information of renowned sources.\\n\", \"name\": \"research_task\", \"expected_output\": \"A set of relevant information about Influenza (Flu)\\n\", \"summary\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Influenza (Flu) Make sure you...\", \"raw\": \"1. **CDC: Influenza (Flu)**\\n   - **Overview**: Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs.\\n   - **Symptoms**: Common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, and sometimes diarrhea and vomiting.\\n   - **Prevention**: Annual vaccination is crucial to prevent influenza.

The illness can manifest in various forms, ranging from mild to severe, and poses a significant risk to people with underlying health conditions, the elderly, and young children. The virus is responsible for seasonal epidemics that can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality rates globally.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of influenza typically begin suddenly and may include:\\n- **Fever**: A high fever often accompanies the flu, generally lasting 3 to 4 days.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent dry cough that can worsen with intensity.\\n- **Sore throat**: Inflammation of the throat can lead to pain while swallowing.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: Congestion can make breathing difficult.\\n- **Body aches**: Common muscular aches can lead to fatigue.\\n- **Headaches**: Frequent and intense headaches are often reported.\\n- **Chills and fatigue**: Accompany flu symptoms, causing exhaustion.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms may include vomiting and diarrhea, which are less common in adults. The variations in symptoms can be attributed to the individual’s health and age, as well as the specific strain of the virus.\\n\\n## Causes\\nThere are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Types A and B are responsible for most seasonal flu outbreaks. Influenza A viruses mutate rapidly, which can lead to significant changes in the virus, accounting for pandemic strains. Influenza B typically causes seasonal epidemics and is generally less severe than type A. Type C causes mild respiratory illness, while type D primarily affects cattle and is not known to infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads through droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention is critical in controlling flu outbreaks. Key methods include:\\n- **Annual vaccination**: Getting vaccinated each year is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications. Vaccines are reviewed and updated annually to target the most prevalent strains.\\n- **Good health practices**: Regular hand washing, using hand sanitizers, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when ill can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.\\n\\n## Treatment and Diagnosis\\nMost individuals recover from the flu without medical intervention; however, antiviral medications may be prescribed to shorten the duration of the illness or to prevent complications in high-risk patients. Diagnosis is often based on clinical symptoms but can be confirmed using rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs).\\n\\n### Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to severe complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Some of the common complications include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: Inflammation of the lungs can occur, requiring hospitalization.\\n- **Bronchitis and sinus infections**: Infections in the airways can lead to further medical issues.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health problems**: Individuals with chronic conditions like asthma or heart disease may experience exacerbated symptoms.\\n\\n## Surveillance and Public Health Impact\\nMonitoring influenza activity is crucial for public health officials to manage outbreaks. Surveillance systems track the prevalence of the virus and its strains to inform vaccination strategies and public health responses.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nInfluenza is a serious public health concern that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Understanding its symptoms, causes, prevention strategies, and treatment can help mitigate the impact of the flu, especially during peak influenza seasons. Public awareness, healthy practices, and vaccination are vital in the ongoing fight against influenza infections. \\n\\nFor further information, visit [CDC Flu Overview](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/index.html), [Mayo Clinic Flu Symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719), [Cleveland Clinic on Influenza](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4335-influenza-flu), and [Illinois Department of Public Health Influenza](https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/respiratory-disease/diseases/influenza.html).\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Influenza (Flu) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_5", "context": {"span_id": "0x8aa9f6b1bd4bcd9f", "trace_id": "0x1fc17f50d206d076e8961c4a66afa121"}, "parent_id": "0x0f7bb12ec1eb7d7a", "start_time": 1742218566584772218, "end_time": 1742218593908897130, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"73af3a9edb914688a0ceb96ffde49d7e\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"1. **CDC: Influenza (Flu)**\\n   - **Overview**: Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs.\\n   - **Symptoms**: Common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, and sometimes diarrhea and vomiting.\\n   - **Prevention**: Annual vaccination is crucial to prevent influenza.

The illness can manifest in various forms, ranging from mild to severe, and poses a significant risk to people with underlying health conditions, the elderly, and young children. The virus is responsible for seasonal epidemics that can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality rates globally.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of influenza typically begin suddenly and may include:\\n- **Fever**: A high fever often accompanies the flu, generally lasting 3 to 4 days.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent dry cough that can worsen with intensity.\\n- **Sore throat**: Inflammation of the throat can lead to pain while swallowing.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: Congestion can make breathing difficult.\\n- **Body aches**: Common muscular aches can lead to fatigue.\\n- **Headaches**: Frequent and intense headaches are often reported.\\n- **Chills and fatigue**: Accompany flu symptoms, causing exhaustion.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms may include vomiting and diarrhea, which are less common in adults. The variations in symptoms can be attributed to the individual’s health and age, as well as the specific strain of the virus.\\n\\n## Causes\\nThere are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Types A and B are responsible for most seasonal flu outbreaks. Influenza A viruses mutate rapidly, which can lead to significant changes in the virus, accounting for pandemic strains. Influenza B typically causes seasonal epidemics and is generally less severe than type A. Type C causes mild respiratory illness, while type D primarily affects cattle and is not known to infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads through droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention is critical in controlling flu outbreaks. Key methods include:\\n- **Annual vaccination**: Getting vaccinated each year is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications. Vaccines are reviewed and updated annually to target the most prevalent strains.\\n- **Good health practices**: Regular hand washing, using hand sanitizers, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when ill can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.\\n\\n## Treatment and Diagnosis\\nMost individuals recover from the flu without medical intervention; however, antiviral medications may be prescribed to shorten the duration of the illness or to prevent complications in high-risk patients. Diagnosis is often based on clinical symptoms but can be confirmed using rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs).\\n\\n### Complications\\nInfluenza can lead to severe complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Some of the common complications include:\\n- **Pneumonia**: Inflammation of the lungs can occur, requiring hospitalization.\\n- **Bronchitis and sinus infections**: Infections in the airways can lead to further medical issues.\\n- **Worsening of chronic health problems**: Individuals with chronic conditions like asthma or heart disease may experience exacerbated symptoms.\\n\\n## Surveillance and Public Health Impact\\nMonitoring influenza activity is crucial for public health officials to manage outbreaks. Surveillance systems track the prevalence of the virus and its strains to inform vaccination strategies and public health responses.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nInfluenza is a serious public health concern that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Understanding its symptoms, causes, prevention strategies, and treatment can help mitigate the impact of the flu, especially during peak influenza seasons. Public awareness, healthy practices, and vaccination are vital in the ongoing fight against influenza infections. \\n\\nFor further information, visit [CDC Flu Overview](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/index.html), [Mayo Clinic Flu Symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719), [Cleveland Clinic on Influenza](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4335-influenza-flu), and [Illinois Department of Public Health Influenza](https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/respiratory-disease/diseases/influenza.html).\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"Thought: I have gathered detailed information from reliable sources regarding the influenza virus.

The virus is responsible for seasonal epidemics that can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality rates globally.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of influenza typically begin suddenly and may include:\\n- **Fever**: A high fever often accompanies the flu, generally lasting 3 to 4 days.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent dry cough that can worsen with intensity.\\n- **Sore throat**: Inflammation of the throat can lead to pain while swallowing.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: Congestion can make breathing difficult.\\n- **Body aches**: Common muscular aches can lead to fatigue.\\n- **Headaches**: Frequent and intense headaches are often reported.\\n- **Chills and fatigue**: Accompany flu symptoms, causing exhaustion.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms may include vomiting and diarrhea, which are less common in adults. The variations in symptoms can be attributed to the individual’s health and age, as well as the specific strain of the virus.\\n\\n## Causes\\nThere are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Types A and B are responsible for most seasonal flu outbreaks. Influenza A viruses mutate rapidly, which can lead to significant changes in the virus, accounting for pandemic strains. Influenza B typically causes seasonal epidemics and is generally less severe than type A. Type C causes mild respiratory illness, while type D primarily affects cattle and is not known to infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads through droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention is critical in controlling flu outbreaks. Key methods include:\\n- **Annual vaccination**: Getting vaccinated each year is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications. Vaccines are reviewed and updated annually to target the most prevalent strains.\\n- **Good health practices**: Regular hand washing, using hand sanitizers, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when ill can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.\\n\\n## Treatment and Diagnosis\\nMost individuals recover from the flu without medical intervention; however, antiviral medications may be prescribed to shorten the duration of the illness or to prevent complications in high-risk patients.

The illness can manifest in various forms, ranging from mild to severe and poses a significant risk to people with underlying health conditions, the elderly, and young children. The virus is responsible for seasonal epidemics that can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality rates globally.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of influenza typically begin suddenly and may include:\\n- **Fever**: A high fever often accompanies the flu, generally lasting 3 to 4 days.\\n- **Cough**: A persistent dry cough that can worsen with intensity.\\n- **Sore throat**: Inflammation of the throat can lead to pain while swallowing.\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**: Congestion can make breathing difficult.\\n- **Body aches**: Common muscular aches can lead to fatigue.\\n- **Headaches**: Frequent and intense headaches are often reported.\\n- **Chills and fatigue**: Accompany flu symptoms, causing exhaustion.\\n\\nIn children, additional symptoms may include vomiting and diarrhea, which are less common in adults. The variations in symptoms can be attributed to the individual’s health and age, as well as the specific strain of the virus.\\n\\n## Causes\\nThere are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Types A and B are responsible for most seasonal flu outbreaks. Influenza A viruses mutate rapidly, which can lead to significant changes in the virus, accounting for pandemic strains. Influenza B typically causes seasonal epidemics and is generally less severe than type A. Type C causes mild respiratory illness, while type D primarily affects cattle and is not known to infect humans.\\n\\n### Transmission\\nInfluenza spreads through droplets made when people with the flu cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention is critical in controlling flu outbreaks. Key methods include:\\n- **Annual vaccination**: Getting vaccinated each year is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications. Vaccines are reviewed and updated annually to target the most prevalent strains.\\n- **Good health practices**: Regular hand washing, using hand sanitizers, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home when ill can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.\\n\\n## Treatment and Diagnosis\\nMost individuals recover from the flu without medical intervention; however, antiviral medications may be prescribed to shorten the duration of the illness or to prevent complications in high-risk patients.

The ticks that mainly carry this disease in the United States are known as black-legged ticks (scientific name: Ixodes scapularis). This disease is particularly common in the northeastern and north-central parts of the U.S. In Europe, another tick called Ixodes ricinus is responsible for spreading it. Lyme disease is the most frequently reported tick-borne illness in the country and can lead to serious health issues if it goes undiagnosed and untreated.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nSymptoms of Lyme disease can show up in different stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:**\\n   - The most noticeable sign is a spreading rash called erythema migrans (EM), which typically appears between 3 to 30 days after being bitten by an infected tick. The rash often looks like a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Early symptoms may include:\\n     - Fever\\n     - Headache\\n     - Fatigue\\n     - Muscle and joint pain\\n     - Swollen lymph nodes\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - If the disease is not treated, it can spread to other parts of the body. This may lead to:\\n     - More rashes\\n     - Facial paralysis (like Bell's palsy)\\n     - Severe headaches\\n     - Neck stiffness\\n     - Heart palpitations\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - This stage can occur months or years after the initial infection, causing chronic issues such as:\\n     - Arthritis\\n     - Cognitive problems (like memory issues)\\n     - Neurological complications, often referred to as Lyme encephalopathy\\n\\n## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is mainly caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and similar species. The following describes how the bacteria works:\\n- The bacteria enter the body through the skin at the tick bite and can spread through the body's lymphatic system and bloodstream to various organs.\\n- The immune system's response to the infection leads to inflammation and potential damage to the heart, brain, and joints.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease typically involves:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** This involves looking at symptoms and confirming recent exposure to ticks, especially checking for the EM rash.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Blood tests are performed to look for antibodies against the Borrelia bacteria. The CDC suggests a two-step testing process: an initial Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) followed by a confirmation test known as Western blot.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment for Lyme disease depends on the stage of the disease:\\n- **Early Stage:** Oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline or amoxicillin, are commonly used and usually prescribed for 10 to 28 days.\\n- **Neurological or Cardiac Involvement:** More serious cases may require intravenous antibiotics, like ceftriaxone, depending on the symptoms.\\n- **Late Stage or Arthritis:** Chronic cases often require a more extended course of antibiotics to manage persistent symptoms.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventing Lyme disease revolves around minimizing risks of tick bites:\\n- Use insect repellents that contain DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wear protective clothing, like long sleeves and pants, when in areas where ticks are common.\\n- Perform body checks for ticks after activities performed outdoors.\\n- Consider using acaricides in residential areas to lower tick populations.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is mostly found in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly thriving in temperate regions. The number of cases has significantly increased, largely due to environmental changes, shifting wildlife patterns, and urbanization that contribute to rising tick populations. Over 62,000 cases were reported in the U.S. in 2022, indicating a growing public health issue.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is an important public health issue that can lead to various health problems. Understanding how it spreads, recognizing the symptoms, and knowing the treatment options is essential for effective management and prevention of severe and lasting complications caused by the disease.\\n\\n## References\\n1.

In the United States, the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the primary vector, particularly in the northeastern and north-central regions. In Europe, Ixodes ricinus serves as the main vector. Lyme disease is the most commonly transmitted tick-borne illness in the U.S. and poses serious health risks if not properly diagnosed and treated.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can manifest in multiple stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:**\\n   - Characterized by the appearance of an expanding rash known as erythema migrans (EM), which typically develops within 3 to 30 days following a tick bite. The rash may resemble a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - If untreated, the infection may spread to other body areas. Symptoms in this stage can include additional rashes, facial paralysis (such as Bell's palsy), severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - This stage may occur months to years after the initial infection, leading to chronic manifestations such as arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological problems, often collectively referred to as Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is primarily caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and related species. The pathophysiology of Lyme disease involves the following:\\n- The spirochete enters the skin at the tick bite site and migrates locally, spreading through the lymphatics and bloodstream to various organs. \\n- The host's immune response leads to inflammation and tissue damage in the heart, nervous system, and joints.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis typically involves a combination of:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Identifying characteristic symptoms and confirming recent tick exposure, particularly the presence of EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Serological tests are employed to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy that consists of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a Western blot for confirmation.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment regimen for Lyme disease is contingent upon its stage:\\n- **Early Stage:** Oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective and are typically administered for 10 to 28 days, depending on the specific case.\\n- **Neurological or Cardiac Involvement:** Intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone may be required, depending on the severity of the symptoms.\\n- **Late Stage or Arthritis:** A longer course of antibiotics is often necessary for addressing Lyme arthritis or chronic symptoms.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention measures focus on minimizing exposure to ticks:\\n- Use insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wear protective clothing (long sleeves and pants) in tick-prone areas.\\n- Conduct body checks for ticks after outdoor activities.\\n- Apply acaricides in residential areas where ticks are prevalent.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is predominantly found in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in temperate regions. The incidence of the disease has significantly increased, correlating with rising tick populations due to environmental factors, wildlife management changes, and urbanization. In 2022, over 62,000 cases were officially reported in the U.S., representing a growing public health challenge.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease remains a significant public health concern with varying potential impacts on health.

In Europe, the primary vector is Ixodes ricinus.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nThe presentation of Lyme disease symptoms typically occurs in stages:\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:** \\n   - The most distinctive sign is an expanding rash called erythema migrans (EM), which usually appears 3–30 days after a tick bite. \\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n   \\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:** \\n   - If left untreated, the infection may spread to other body parts. Symptoms may include additional rashes, facial paralysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n   \\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:** \\n   - Occurring months to years after infection, potential chronic manifestations include arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological issues—often termed Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n### Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochete bacteria, particularly Borrelia burgdorferi and others. Diagnosis typically involves:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Based on symptoms and history of tick exposure, particularly identifying EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Utilizes serologic tests to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy (ELISA followed by Western blot).\\n\\n### Treatment\\nAntibiotic treatment is essential for Lyme disease and varies according to the stage of the disease:\\n- **Oral antibiotics** (e.g., doxycycline, amoxicillin) are generally effective for early-stage Lyme disease.\\n- **Intravenous antibiotics** (e.g., ceftriaxone) may be necessary for severe neurological involvement or Lyme carditis.\\nTypical treatment durations are from 14 to 28 days, depending on the stage and severity of the disease.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nPrevention strategies are aimed at reducing tick bites:\\n- Use of insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wearing protective clothing when in tick-infested areas.\\n- Conducting tick checks after outdoor activities.\\n- Applying acaricides in residential areas can reduce tick populations.\\n\\n### Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in temperate areas. The disease has seen a significant rise in cases, largely due to environmental factors such as wildlife management and urbanization changes affecting tick populations.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a significant public health concern with diverse and sometimes severe health implications. Understanding its transmission, symptoms, and effective management strategies is crucial for both prevention and treatment.\\n\\n#### References:\\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash , known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. [ 1 ] The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. [ 1 ] Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. [ 1 ] Early diagnosis can be difficult. [ 11 ] Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness . [ 1 ] If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face , joint pains , severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations . [ 1 ] Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. [ 1 ] Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. [ 1 ]\\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes . [ 12 ] In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , \\\"In most cases, a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.\\\" [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In North America, the bacterial species Borrelia burgdorferi and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease. [ 4 ] [ 16 ] In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii , Borrelia garinii , B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. [ 4 ] The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals nor through food. [ 13 ] Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. [ 5 ] [ 17 ] Blood tests are often falsely negative in the early stages of the disease. [ 4 ] Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. [ 18 ]\\nPrevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin -based insect repellents . [ 4 ] [ 9 ] Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. [ 4 ] Ticks can be removed using tweezers . [ 19 ] If the removed tick is full of blood a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent the development of infection but is not generally recommended since the development of infection is rare. [ 4 ] If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime . [ 4 ] Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. [ 4 ] Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment, which may last for one or two days. [ 4 ] In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. [ 4 ] [ 20 ]\\nLyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. [ 21 ] [ 8 ] Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. [ 4 ] Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . [ 22 ] The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer . [ 23 ] People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). [ 24 ] PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease , a term no longer supported by scientists and used in different ways by different groups. [ 20 ] [ 25 ] Some healthcare providers claim that chronic Lyme is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment. [ 26 ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] , clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced, but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. [ 27 ] There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nSigns and symptoms [ edit ]\\nLyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms.\\n20% of Lyme rashes in the United States show a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" appearance. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]\\nErythema migrans (\\\"migrating redness\\\") on a woman's neck. [ 31 ] Rashes from non-Lyme causes may look similar. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]\\nThe incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). [ 34 ] Lyme symptoms most often occur from the month of May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases. [ 34 ]\\nEarly localized infection [ edit ]\\n80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit , groin , back of the knee , or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (median is 16 cm). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] [ 32 ]\\nThe rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. [ 4 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM) which translates as \\\"migrating redness.\\\" In about 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges possibly forming a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" pattern, but this clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. [ 32 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. [ 4 ]\\nThe Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms. [ 4 ]\\nPeople with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis . [ 35 ]\\nNot everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms, and many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases. [ 36 ]\\nAsymptomatic infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States. [ 37 ] Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe. [ 38 ]\\nEarly disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nWithin days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the Borrelia bacteria may spread through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10–20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. [ 28 ] Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common. [ 28 ]\\nIn about 10–15% of untreated people, Lyme causes neurological problems known as neuroborreliosis . [ 39 ] Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4–6 weeks (range 1–12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy, and/or mononeuritis multiplex. [ 35 ] [ 40 ] Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. [ 41 ] After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms . Up to 76.5% of them present as tinnitus , the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness (53.7%) and hearing loss (16.7%) were the next most common symptoms. [ 42 ] In children, partial loss of vision may also occur. [ 35 ] Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves . When due to Lyme, it most typically causes facial palsy , impairing blinking, smiling, and chewing on one or both sides of the face. It may also cause intermittent double vision . [ 35 ] [ 41 ] Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness , numbness , or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots , e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. [ 39 ] [ 35 ] Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord , with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech , impaired movement , impaired motor planning , or shaking . [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn North America, facial palsy is the typical early neuroborreliosis presentation, occurring in 5–10% of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. [ 35 ] [ 44 ] Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. [ 45 ] In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome , accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ] In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. [ 38 ] In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%). [ 40 ]\\nIn about 4–10% of untreated cases in the United States and 0.3–4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days to 7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness , fainting , shortness of breath , and chest pain . [ 46 ] Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches , facial palsy , headaches , or radicular pain . [ 46 ] In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis in 19–87% of people adversely impacts the heart's electrical conduction system, causing atrioventricular block that often manifests as heart rhythms that alternate within minutes between abnormally slow and abnormally fast. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 10–15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly , left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure. [ 46 ]\\nAnother skin condition, found in Europe but not in North America, is borrelial lymphocytoma , a purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum . [ 48 ]\\nLate disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nLyme arthritis caused this 3-year-old girl's knee to become swollen. Though painless, it did make her limp. [ 49 ]\\nLyme arthritis occurs in up to 60% of untreated people, typically starting about six months after infection. [ 28 ] It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip , other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint . [ 35 ] [ 50 ] Usually, large joint effusion and swelling occur, but only mild or moderate pain. [ 35 ] Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time, but periodically return. [ 35 ] Baker's cysts may form and rupture.\\n In early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and over time possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis that discovered poor documentation of this manifestation, experts wondered if it exists at all in the US or is merely very rare. [ 35 ] [ 51 ]\\nA neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia , a general sense of feeling unwell , and changes in personality. [ 52 ] Lyme encephalopathy is controversial in the US and has not been reported in Europe. [ 8 ] Problems such as depression and fibromyalgia are as common in people with Lyme disease as in the general population. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] There is no compelling evidence that Lyme disease causes psychiatric disorders, behavioral disorders (e.g. ADHD ), or developmental disorders (e.g. autism ). [ 55 ]\\nAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly. [ 48 ] It begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. [ 56 ] It is also associated with peripheral neuropathy. [ 51 ]\\nCause [ edit ]\\nMain article: Lyme disease microbiology\\nFurther information: Weather and climate effects on Lyme disease exposure\\nBorrelia bacteria, the causative agents of Lyme disease, magnified\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochetes , gram-negative bacteria from the genus Borrelia . Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella . [ 57 ] The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato , and show a great deal of genetic diversity . [ 58 ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato is a species complex made up of 20 accepted and three proposed genospecies. Eight species are known to cause Lyme disease: B. mayonii (found in North America), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (found in North America and Europe), B. afzelii , B. garinii, B. spielmanii, and B. lusitaniae (all found in Eurasia ). [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 16 ] [ 10 ] Some studies have also proposed that B. valaisiana may sometimes infect humans, but this species does not seem to be an important cause of disease. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]\\nTick life cycle [ edit ]\\nDeer tick life cycle\\nIxodes scapularis , the primary vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America\\nThree stages occur in the life cycle of a tick - larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and are usually most active in late spring and early summer in regions where the climate is mild. During the adult stage, Lyme disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and tend to be larger in size, so can be easily seen and removed. [ 63 ]\\nTransmission [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is classified as a zoonosis , as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts . [ 64 ] Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia ). [ 65 ] Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage , because they are very small, thus may feed for long periods of time undetected. [ 64 ] Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. [ 66 ] Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. [ 67 ] The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected. [ 68 ] Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Borrelia from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse , and occasionally birds. [ 69 ] Areas where Lyme is common are expanding. [ 70 ]\\nWithin the tick midgut, the Borrelia ' s outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the Borrelia downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection. [ 71 ] Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC. [ 72 ]\\nTick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. [ 73 ]\\nWhile B. burgdorferi is most associated with ticks hosted by white-tailed deer and white-footed mice , Borrelia afzelii is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto . The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association. [ 74 ]\\nBudding research has suggested that B. burgdorferi sensu lato may also be able to form enzootic cycle among lizard populations; [ 75 ] this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations of lizards, such as California. Except for one study in Europe, [ 74 ] much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia , it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific. [ 79 ]\\nTick Ixodes ricinus , developmental stages\\nIn Europe, the main vector is Ixodes ricinus , which is also called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. [ 80 ] In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector. [ 81 ] In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) is the main vector on the East Coast. [ 68 ]\\nThe lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as Texas , is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes , [ 82 ] though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness , which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease. [ 83 ]\\nOn the West Coast of the United States , the main vector is the western black-legged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ). [ 84 ] The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the western fence lizard that are resistant to Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West. [ 85 ] [ 79 ]\\nTransmission can occur across the placenta during pregnancy and as with a number of other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\\nThere is no scientific evidence to support Lyme disease transmission via blood transfusion, sexual contact, or breast milk. [ 90 ]\\nTick-borne co-infections [ edit ]\\nMain article: Tick-borne disease\\nTicks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other microbes, such as Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. [ 91 ] Among people with early Lyme disease, depending on their location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–10% will have babesiosis. [ 55 ] Ticks in certain regions also transmit viruses that cause tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan virus disease . [ 92 ] [ 55 ] Co-infections of Lyme disease may not require additional treatment, since they may resolve on their own or—as in the case of HGA—can be treated with the doxycycline prescribed for Lyme. [ 35 ] Persistent fever or compatible anomalous laboratory findings may be indicative of a co-infection. [ 55 ]\\nPathophysiology [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. [ 72 ] [ 93 ] B. Burgdorferi does not produce toxins. [ 94 ] Therefore, many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to spirochete in those tissues. [ 95 ]\\nB. burgdorferi is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. [ 96 ] Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. [ 97 ] This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis . The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. [ 72 ] Neutrophils , however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body. [ 98 ]\\nDays to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete. [ 99 ]\\nIf untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. [ 100 ] The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement , and hiding in the extracellular matrix , which may interfere with the function of immune factors. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]\\nImmunological studies [ edit ]\\nExposure to the Borrelia bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging inflammatory response , [ 103 ] a form of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease. [ 104 ] The production of this reaction might be due to a form of molecular mimicry , where Borrelia avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]\\nChronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever , but its wider application is controversial. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash, facial palsy , or arthritis ), history of possible exposure to infected ticks , and possibly laboratory tests . [ 4 ] [ 28 ] People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1–2 months. [ 35 ] Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common , within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull's eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms. [ 4 ] [ 111 ] In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota , but it is expanding into other areas. [ 70 ] Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk. [ 112 ]\\nIn the absence of an EM rash or history of tick exposure, Lyme diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation. [ 65 ] [ 113 ] The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time-consuming to grow in the laboratory. [ 4 ] [ 65 ] The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. [ 114 ] A positive antibody test result does not by itself prove active infection but can confirm an infection that is suspected because of symptoms, objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. [ 65 ] Because as many as 5–20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be tested for Lyme antibodies: a positive result would likely be false, possibly causing unnecessary treatment. [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available. [ 44 ] [ 115 ]\\nLaboratory testing [ edit ]\\nTests for antibodies in the blood by ELISA and Western blot is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. [ 116 ] The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2–4 weeks and 4–6 weeks, and peak at 6–8 weeks. [ 117 ] When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. [ 35 ] Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. [ 117 ] A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false-positive result. [ 118 ] The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4–6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years. [ 117 ]\\nOther tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii and almost always involves lymphocytic pleocytosis , i.e. the densities of lymphocytes (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Demonstration by lumbar puncture and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans , which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). [ 40 ] In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative. [ 119 ] American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat. [ 43 ] In infection involving the PNS, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment. [ 41 ]\\nIn Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography may show myocardial dysfunction. [ 46 ] Biopsy and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure. [ 46 ]\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material ( DNA ) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia . PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. [ 121 ] [ 40 ] Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during infection. [ 122 ] [ 40 ] Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid. [ 123 ] Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people. [ 40 ]\\nSeveral other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. OspA antigens , shed by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. [ 124 ] The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years. [ 127 ]\\nThe CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of B. burgdorferi , and lymphocyte transformation tests. [ 122 ]\\nImaging [ edit ]\\nNeuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis , but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. [ 128 ] Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vasculitis and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease , which makes them questionable. [ 129 ]\\nDifferential diagnosis [ edit ]\\nCommunity clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23–28% of erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. [ 113 ] EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites , cellulitis , or shingles . [ 113 ] Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull's eye. [ 4 ] Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2–3 cm/day and a diameter of at least 5 cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. [ 28 ] [ 32 ] Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee. [ 28 ] Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve's dermatome , and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. [ 130 ]\\nFacial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy . [ 44 ] Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. [ 44 ] Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. [ 44 ] Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. [ 44 ] Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. [ 44 ]\\nUnlike viral meningitis , Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy , or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF . [ 35 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the limbs is often misdiagnosed as a radiculopathy caused by nerve root compression, such as sciatica . [ 113 ] [ 131 ] Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4–6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating risks of other possible causes that, although less frequent, require immediate diagnosis and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. [ 132 ] A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms of lymphocytic meningitis, or facial palsy would lead to suspicion of Lyme disease and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation. [ 132 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and acute coronary syndrome . [ 45 ] [ 113 ] Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new \\\"great imitator\\\". [ 133 ] As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms. [ 134 ]\\nPrevention [ edit ]\\nTick bites may be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. [ 135 ] [ 9 ]\\nMost Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. [ 28 ] [ 135 ] Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands , shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. [ 28 ] [ 136 ] Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\\\"quest\\\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. [ 138 ] In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. [ 137 ] Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. [ 137 ] [ 135 ] In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. [ 137 ] Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. [ 137 ] [ 139 ] Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. [ 136 ]\\nAs a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. [ 135 ] [ 140 ] Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. [ 141 ] After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). [ 141 ] Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. [ 139 ] Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. [ 139 ] Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. [ 142 ] Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. [ 140 ] Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. [ 140 ] [ 143 ]\\nThe EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET , picaridin , IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD) . [ 135 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. [ 140 ] The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. [ 145 ] Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. [ 145 ] Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. [ 140 ] [ 144 ] Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). [ 140 ] [ 135 ] If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. [ 140 ] Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. [ 140 ]\\nAfter coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. [ 135 ] Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or warm dryer are not enough). [ 135 ] Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduce risk of infection. [ 135 ] Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister . [ 146 ] The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair. [ 135 ]\\nTick removal [ edit ]\\nRemoval of a tick using tweezers\\nAttached ticks should be removed promptly. Risk of infection increases with time of attachment, but in North America risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. [ 147 ] CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from the skin without twisting, jerking, squeezing or crushing the tick. [ 148 ] After tick removal, any tick parts remaining in the skin should be removed with a clean tweezer, if possible. [ 148 ] The wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. [ 148 ] The tick may be disposed by placing it in a container with alcohol, sealed bag, tape or flushed down the toilet. [ 148 ] The bitten person should write down where and when the bite happened so that this can be informed to a doctor if the person gets a rash or flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. [ 148 ] CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it. [ 148 ]\\nIn Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. [ 149 ] Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. [ 149 ] Another method consists in using about 20 cm of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]\\nPreventive antibiotics [ edit ]\\nThe risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. [ 28 ] It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. [ 28 ] If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70–80% of people infected). [ 4 ] [ 28 ]\\nGarden landscaping [ edit ]\\nSeveral landscaping practices may reduce the risk of tick bites in residential yards. [ 146 ] [ 152 ] These include keeping lawns mown, removing leaf litter and weeds and avoiding the use of ground cover. [ 146 ] A 3-ft-wide rock or woodchip barrier is recommended to separate lawns from wood piles, woodlands , stone walls and shrubs. [ 152 ] Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it to kill ticks. [ 152 ] A sun-exposed tick-safe zone at least 9 ft from the barrier should concentrate human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. [ 152 ] Materials such as wood decking, concrete, bricks, gravel or woodchips used on the ground under patios and playgrounds would discourage ticks there. [ 146 ] An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone. [ 152 ] [ 146 ]\\nOccupational exposure [ edit ]\\nOutdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active. [ 155 ]\\nHost animals [ edit ]\\nTicks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards , birds , mice , cats , dogs , deer , cattle and humans . The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \\\"dilution hosts\\\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and so decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. White-tailed deer are both a food source and a \\\"reproductive host\\\", where ticks tend to mate. [ 156 ] The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. Availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted. [ 157 ]\\nIn the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine , [ 158 ] and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. [ 159 ] Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. [ 160 ] While these studies have found these effects, other studies have found opposite effects. A study done in Massachusetts removed deer and did not see a significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. [ 161 ] Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to effectively control tick populations. [ 162 ] One study summarized the results of multiple studies all looking at deer reduction controlling tick populations and determined that deer control can't be used as a standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that since most of the studies looking at this are not good representatives of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. [ 163 ] There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen, would decrease Lyme disease risk the most. [ 164 ]\\nOthers have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not Borrelia burgdorferi reservoirs. This is because it was found that white-tailed deer blood actually kills the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. [ 165 ] Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks , may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission. [ 157 ]\\nTick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. [ 166 ] They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals through the use of acaricides has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on a number of grounds. Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment. [ 167 ]\\nIn Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). [ 168 ] These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. [ 168 ] \\\"The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus ; [ 169 ] \\\" it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi \\\" thought Jaenson & al. (1992) [ 170 ] (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, [ 171 ] as red deer and wild boars ( Sus scrofa ), [ 169 ] in which one Rickettsia and three Borrelia species were identified\\\", [ 169 ] with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. [ 172 ] Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe \\\" two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified \\\". [ 169 ]\\nVaccination [ edit ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] no human vaccines for Lyme disease were available. [ 27 ] The only human vaccine to advance to market was LYMErix, which was available from 1998, but discontinued in 2002. [ 173 ] The vaccine candidate VLA15 was scheduled to start a phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2022, with other research ongoing. Multiple vaccines are available for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nLYMErix [ edit ]\\nThe vaccine LYMErix was available from 1998 to 2002. The recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, was developed by SmithKline Beecham . In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine was found to confer protective immunity to Lyme disease in 76% of adults after three doses with only mild or moderate and transient adverse effects . [ 174 ] [ 175 ] On 21 December 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix on the basis of these trials for persons of ages 15 through 70. [ 175 ] [ 173 ]\\nFollowing approval of the vaccine , its entry into clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. [ 176 ] Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline , alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints. [ 177 ]\\nDespite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, [ 178 ] in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. [ 177 ] [ 179 ] The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a \\\"cautionary tale\\\"; [ 179 ] an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which \\\"unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.\\\" [ 180 ] The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told Nature : \\\"This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.\\\" [ 177 ] [ 181 ]\\nVLA15 [ edit ]\\nThe hexavalent (OspA) protein subunit-based vaccine candidate VLA15 was developed by Valneva . It was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017. [ 182 ] [ 183 ] In April 2020 Pfizer paid $130 million for the rights to the vaccine, and the companies are developing it together, performing multiple phase 2 trials. [ 184 ]\\nA phase 3 trial of VLA15 was scheduled for late 2022, recruiting volunteers at test sites located across the northeastern United States and in Europe. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Participants were scheduled to receive an initial three-dose series of vaccines over the course of five to nine months, followed by a booster dose after twelve months, with both the initial series and the booster dose scheduled to be complete before the year's peak Lyme disease season. [ 186 ]\\nOther research [ edit ]\\nAn mRNA vaccine designed to cause a strong fast immune response to tick saliva allowed the immune system to detect and remove the ticks from test animals before they were able to transmit the infectious bacteria. [ 187 ] The vaccine contains mRNAs for the body to build 19 proteins in tick saliva which, by enabling quick development of erythema (itchy redness) at the bite site, protects guinea pigs against Lyme disease. It also protected the test animals if the tick is not removed if only one tick, but not three, remain attached. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\\nCanine vaccines [ edit ]\\nCanine vaccines have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet- Schering-Plough 's vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA . The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial , generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog. [ 190 ]\\nTreatment [ edit ]\\nAntibiotics are the primary treatment. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. [ 28 ] For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. [ 28 ] People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns . [ 35 ] Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; [ 28 ] alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , and azithromycin . [ 28 ] Azithromycin is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. [ 35 ] The standard treatment for cellulitis , cephalexin , is not useful for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , as these are effective against both infections. [ 35 ] Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy , radiculopathy , meningitis , or peripheral neuropathy . [ 28 ] Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; [ 28 ] cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives. [ 28 ]\\nTreatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7–14 days in early localized disease, to 14–21 days in early disseminated disease to 14–28 days in late disseminated disease. [ 55 ] Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. [ 120 ] In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone . [ 120 ] Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. [ 28 ] [ 35 ] Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no evidence shows it to be effective. [ 28 ] [ 191 ] IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. [ 28 ] As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. [ 28 ]\\nFacial palsy may resolve without treatment: however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. [ 35 ] Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. [ 44 ] In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. [ 44 ] [ 192 ]\\nAbout a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids. [ 46 ]\\nPeople with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping should use crutches. [ 193 ] Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [ 35 ] Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. [ 35 ] [ 193 ] People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for Borrelia DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. [ 35 ] [ 55 ] [ 193 ] Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy , or physical therapy. [ 55 ] [ 193 ]\\nPeople receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it . [ 115 ]\\nPrognosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease's typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. [ 4 ] However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues. [ 35 ]\\nPeople who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. [ 113 ] Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64–71% at end of treatment for EM rash to about 84–90% after 30 months; higher percentages are reported in Europe. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Treatment failure, i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. [ 194 ] Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g. joint or muscle pains or fatigue . [ 196 ] These symptoms are usually mild and nondisabling. [ 196 ]\\nPeople treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits, in addition to subjective symptoms. [ 35 ] In Europe, an average of 32–33 months after initial Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14–21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with only an EM rash (16%). [ 197 ] In another European study, 5 years after treatment for neuroborreliosis lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter were less common among those treated within 30 days of the first symptom (16%) than among those treated later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated. [ 198 ]\\nSome data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] However, in Europe 41% of people treated for facial palsy had other lingering symptoms at followup up to 6 months later, including 28% with numbness or altered sensation and 14% with fatigue or concentration problems. [ 200 ] Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. [ 199 ] [ 201 ] Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another one is voluntarily moved) can become evident only 6–12 months after facial palsy appears to be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. [ 202 ] Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. [ 202 ] In longer-term follow-up, 16–23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover. [ 202 ]\\nIn Europe, about a quarter of people with Bannwarth syndrome (Lyme radiculopathy and lymphocytic meningitis ) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3–6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection in cerebrospinal fluid ; after 12 months, 64% recovered fully, 31% had nondisabling mild or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or required substantial use of analgesics. [ 43 ] The most common lingering nondisabling symptoms were headache, fatigue , altered sensation , joint pains , memory disturbances, malaise , radicular pain , sleep disturbances, muscle pains , and concentration disturbances. Lingering disabling symptoms included facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ]\\nRecovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage. [ 35 ]\\nAbout half the people with Lyme carditis progress to complete heart block , but it usually resolves in a week. [ 46 ] Other Lyme heart conduction abnormalities resolve typically within 6 weeks. [ 46 ] About 94% of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). [ 46 ] Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. [ 46 ] However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal. [ 46 ]\\nRecommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several months for inflammation to resolve and a second round of antibiotics is often necessary. [ 35 ] Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9–14 months (range 4 months – 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery. [ 193 ]\\nReinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6–11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. [ 194 ] The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain. [ 203 ]\\nPost-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [ edit ]\\nChronic symptoms like pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment are experienced by 5–20% of people who contract Lyme disease, even after completing treatment. This is called Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. [ 24 ] [ 204 ]\\nThe cause is unknown. One hypothesis is that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains. However, human and animal trials have not provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. [ 205 ] Another hypothesis is that autoimmunity has been triggered by the infection. Auto–immune responses are known to occur following other infections, including Campylobacter ( Guillain-Barré syndrome ), Chlamydia (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease). A third hypothesis is that debris from \\na previous infection could remain. [ 205 ]\\nAnother hypothesis is that symptoms are simply unrelated to a Lyme infection. [ 206 ] [ 207 ] In studies of people who presented to clinics with concerns about Lyme disease, 47 to 80% had no evidence of Lyme infection while 15 to 55% (median 34%) were able to obtain other diagnoses. [ 205 ]\\nThere is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective in early Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotics are not. They have been shown ineffective in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and is similar to the management of fibromyalgia or ME/CFS . PTLDS usually gets better over time, but recovery may take many months. [ 206 ]\\nEpidemiology and prevalence [ edit ]\\nCountries with reported Lyme disease cases\\nOverview [ edit ]\\nLyme disease occurs regularly in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. [ 208 ]\\nLyme disease effects are comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds.\\n An estimated 476,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated for the disease in the United States. This number is probably an overestimate due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated in Europe. [ 8 ] [ 4 ] [ 209 ]\\nThere is a suggestion that tick populations and Lyme disease occurrence are increasing and spreading into new areas, owing in part to the warming temperatures of climate change . [ 210 ] However, tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. [ 157 ] [ 211 ]\\nNorth America [ edit ]\\nMany studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of I. scapularis projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S. [ 212 ] A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. [ 213 ] The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology . [ 213 ]\\nUnited States [ edit ]\\nCDC map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the Northeast Megalopolis and western Wisconsin\\nLyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ]\\nAlthough Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). [ 90 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria has been modified multiple times. [ 219 ] The 2022 surveillance case definition classifies cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect. [ 220 ] The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.\\n The CDC emphasizes that, while surveillance data has limitations, it is useful due to \\\"uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness.\\\" While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted. [ 221 ] [ 90 ]\\nSeveral similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), also known as Masters disease. Amblyomma americanum , known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment. [ 222 ]\\nIn recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever. [ 218 ]\\nCanada [ edit ]\\nThe range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. [ 112 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] A model-based prediction by Leighton et al. (2012) suggests that the range of the I. scapularis tick will expand into Canada by 46 km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread. [ 226 ]\\nEurope [ edit ]\\nIn Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete B. burgdorferi sensu lato , mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus . [ 227 ] Cases of B. burgdorferi sensu lato -infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. [ 228 ] The number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. [ 229 ] Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising. [ 230 ] Lyme disease is rare in Iceland. On average around 6 to 7 cases are diagnosed every year, primarily localised infections presenting as erythema migrans. None of the cases had a definitive Icelandic origin and the yearly number of cases has not been increasing. [ 231 ]\\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\\nIn the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986 [ 232 ] when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Ireland combined. [ 233 ] In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, [ 234 ] but 973 in 2009 [ 232 ] and 953 in 2010. [ 235 ] Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010. [ 236 ]\\nIt is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year [ 235 ] (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas [ 232 ] ), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 \\\"to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor.\\\" [ 237 ] [ 238 ]\\nDespite Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi infection) being a notifiable disease in Scotland [ 239 ] since January 1990 [ 240 ] which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. [ 241 ] Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. [ 232 ]\\nAlthough there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest , Salisbury Plain , Exmoor , the South Downs , parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire , Thetford Forest [ 242 ] and the West coast and islands of Scotland, [ 243 ] infected ticks are widespread and can even be found in the parks of London. [ 234 ] [ 244 ] A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive , as were between 2% and 4–5% of the general local population of the area. [ 245 ] [ 246 ]\\nTests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] It is speculated that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. [ 249 ] However no published research has proven this to be so.\\nSouth America [ edit ]\\nIn Brazil, Lyme disease is not considered endemic. [ 250 ] A Lyme-like disease known as Baggio–Yoshinari syndrome has been described, attributed to microorganisms that do not belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted by ticks of the Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera. [ 251 ] The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia , São Paulo. [ 252 ] A 2024 analysis concluded that evidence to connect BYS to Borrelia bacteria was lacking. [ 250 ]\\nMexico [ edit ]\\nA 2007 study suggests Borrelia burgdorferi infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000. [ 253 ]\\nAfrica [ edit ]\\nIn northern Africa, B. burgdorferi sensu lato has been identified in Morocco , Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia . [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ]\\nLyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this region. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of Lyme infection in Africa. [ 257 ] In East Africa, two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya . [ 258 ] According The Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa, Lyme disease is not known to be endemic in either South Africa or Mozambique. [ 259 ]\\nAsia [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato -infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China, Nepal , Thailand and far eastern Russia. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Borrelia has also been isolated in Mongolia . [ 262 ]\\nAustraliasia [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is not considered endemic to Australia. [ 263 ] While there have been reports of people acquiring Lyme disease in Australia, and even evidence of closely related Borrelia species in ticks, [ 264 ] the evidence linking these cases to local transmission is limited. Ongoing research on resolving potential Borrelia species to Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT) in Australia are ongoing. [ 265 ]\\nEtymology [ edit ]\\nLyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . [ 266 ]\\nHistory [ edit ]\\nEarly evidence [ edit ]\\nThe earliest known evidence of Lyme disease was found in Oetzi , a 5300 year old mummy in the Eastern Alps near the Italian border. [ 267 ] \\nThe evolutionary history of Borrelia burgdorferi genetics has been examined by scientists. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the mid-west that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. [ 268 ]\\nJohn Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663 to 1670, wrote \\\"there be infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\\\" [ 269 ]\\nThis is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm , a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus , and who found the forests of New York \\\"abound\\\" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. [ 270 ]\\nPerhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. [ 271 ] He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \\\"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\\\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \\\"worm\\\" with a body which is \\\"of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\\\" that \\\"penetrates the skin\\\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. [ 272 ]\\nThe examination of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. [ 270 ] The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman , a 5,300-year-old mummy , revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. [ 273 ]\\nThe early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau , Germany (now Wrocław , Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who for 16 years had had a degenerative skin disorder now known as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans . [ 274 ]\\nAt a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion erythema migrans . [ 274 ] The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911. [ 275 ]\\nModern history [ edit ]\\nThe modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult. [ 276 ]\\nNeurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. [ 277 ] In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.\\n Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. [ 278 ] Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. [ citation needed ] Starting in 1946, facilities in Sweden experimented with treating EM rashes with substances known to kill spirochetes. [ 279 ] Einar Hollström  [ sv ] reported that \\\"penicillin was found to be the most effective.\\\" [ 280 ] In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. [ 281 ] In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe. [ 282 ] [ 283 ]\\nIn 1970 a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin. [ 284 ]\\nThe full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme , which gave the disease its popular name. [ 285 ] This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service , and by others from Yale University , including Stephen Malawista , who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. [ 286 ] The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that \\\"Lyme arthritis\\\" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe. [ 287 ]\\nBefore 1976, the elements of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius's disease, [ 288 ] Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, [ 289 ] [ 290 ] Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis. [ 291 ] [ 292 ]\\nIn 1980, Steere, et al. , began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. [ 293 ] In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer , a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory , with collections of I. dammini [ scapularis ] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed \\\"poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.\\\" Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the \\\"long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.\\\" Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour \\\"offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.\\\" Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. [ 294 ] In June 1982, he published his findings in Science , and the spirochete was named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor. [ 295 ]\\nAfter the identification of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics , amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone . [ 296 ] [ 297 ] The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands. [ 298 ]\\nSociety, culture, and controversy [ edit ]\\nLandscape changes and urbanization [ edit ]\\nUrbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents—the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector , the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. [ 301 ]\\nThe dilution effect [ edit ]\\nGiven these habitat-host dynamics, in 2003 some researchers began to postulate whether the so called dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease. [ 299 ] The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that an increase in host biodiversity will result in a decrease in the number of vectors infected with B. burgdorferi . [ 299 ] Scientific research has shown that nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) decreases as the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect. [ 299 ] That said, there is no direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven. [ 299 ] Additionally, as of 2018, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates [ 302 ]\\nChronic Lyme disease [ edit ]\\nMain article: Chronic Lyme disease\\nThe term \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, [ 303 ] and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] [ 304 ] Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with B. burgdorferi or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing non-specific symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease. [ 305 ]\\nThe 2008 documentary Under Our Skin is known for promoting controversial and unrecognized theories about \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\". [ 306 ]\\nConspiracy theories about origins [ edit ]\\nProlific but unfounded conspiracy theories have alleged that Lyme disease was a biological weapon that originated in the Plum Island laboratory , which is near Old Lyme, Connecticut. [ 307 ] A discredited 2004 book entitled Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory fueled the conspiracy theories. [ 308 ] [ 309 ] Archived specimens show that Lyme disease was endemic well before the establishment of Plum Island laboratory. [ 307 ] Additionally, Lyme disease was never a topic of research at Plum Island, according to the US Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture. [ 310 ] [ 308 ]\\nIn 2024 and 2025, conspiracy theories about the origins of Lyme disease were further spread due to attention from Robert F. Kennedy Jr . [ 311 ]\\nOther animals [ edit ]\\nDogs [ edit ]\\nPrevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step. [ 312 ]\\nAnother crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes ( Amitraz ), phenylpyrazoles ( Fipronil ), or permethrin ( pyrethroids ). [ 313 ] These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. [ 312 ] Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos. [ 313 ]\\nExamination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears. [ 314 ]\\nIn dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, [ 315 ] which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. [ 190 ] Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. [ 316 ] [ verification needed ] In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs. [ 317 ]\\nCats [ edit ]\\nUnlike dogs, it is very rare for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with B. burgdorferi , following a bite from an infected tick. Cats who are infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including but not limited to lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. [ 318 ] In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans. [ 319 ] However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be asymptomatic , and show no noticeable signs of the disease. [ 319 ] [ 318 ] Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required. [ 318 ]\\nHorses [ edit ]\\nLyme disease in horses is often challenging to diagnose because symptoms vary widely. Common acute symptoms include weight loss, fever, lameness , ataxia , and other muscle and joint-related issues. [ 320 ] [ 321 ] [ 322 ] Additional symptoms include muscle tenderness, swollen joints, arthritis , and neck stiffness. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] Chronic symptoms of the disease typically include neurological manifestations, such as meningitis , cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis , and encephalitis . [ 326 ] [ 320 ] [ 327 ] [ 328 ] Furthermore, it is important to note that some horses do not slow clinical signs of Lyme disease. [ 329 ]\\nThere are three main testing strategies used to diagnose horses with Lyme disease. They include clinical evaluation, serological testing , and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. [ 330 ] [ 331 ] [ 321 ] Detection of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine Lyme disease and unspecific testing for antibodies is not recommended. [ 332 ]\\nTypical treatment involves antibiotics such as oxytetracycline , doxycycline , ceftriaxone , or minocycline . [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 329 ] In some cases, a combination of antibiotics may be administered. Doxycycline and minocycline are taken orally, while oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are usually administered intravenously. [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 329 ] The duration and dosage of treatment vary widely among cases. In most cases, the infected horse is euthanized . [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 327 ] [ 336 ] Death of horses as a result of Borrelia burgdorferi infection remains unknown. [ 337 ]\\nCurrently, there is no approved Lyme disease vaccine for horses available. [ 338 ] However, a study demonstrated that ponies could be protected using an aluminum adjuvanted recombinant outer-surface protein A (rOspA) vaccine. [ 339 ] While horses have been administered a Lyme disease vaccine designed for dogs, it elicits only a short-lasting antibody response. [ 338 ] Another study supports the use of commercial Lyme disease vaccines, showing that they do elicit an antibody response, which can be significantly enhanced when horses receive an additional booster vaccine.

Compared to non-immunized guinea pigs, vaccinated animals exposed to infected ticks quickly developed redness at the tick bite site. None of the immunized animals developed Lyme disease if ticks were removed when redness developed. In contrast, about half of the control group became infected with B. burgdorferi after tick removal. When a single infected tick was attached to immunized guinea pigs and not removed, none of vaccinated animals were infected compared to 60 percent of control animals. However, protection waned in immunized guinea pigs if three ticks remained attached to the animal. Ticks in immunized animals were unable to feed aggressively and dislodged more quickly than those on guinea pigs in the control group.\\n^ Sajid A, Matias J, Arora G, Kurokawa C, DePonte K, Tang X, et al.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash , known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. [ 1 ] The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. [ 1 ] Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. [ 1 ] Early diagnosis can be difficult. [ 11 ] Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness . [ 1 ] If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face , joint pains , severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations . [ 1 ] Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. [ 1 ] Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. [ 1 ]\\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes . [ 12 ] In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , \\\"In most cases, a tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours or more before the Lyme disease bacterium can be transmitted. If you remove a tick quickly (within 24 hours), you can greatly reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.\\\" [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In North America, the bacterial species Borrelia burgdorferi and B. mayonii cause Lyme disease. [ 4 ] [ 16 ] In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii , Borrelia garinii , B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. [ 4 ] The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals nor through food. [ 13 ] Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. [ 5 ] [ 17 ] Blood tests are often falsely negative in the early stages of the disease. [ 4 ] Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. [ 18 ]\\nPrevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin -based insect repellents . [ 4 ] [ 9 ] Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. [ 4 ] Ticks can be removed using tweezers . [ 19 ] If the removed tick is full of blood a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent the development of infection but is not generally recommended since the development of infection is rare. [ 4 ] If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime . [ 4 ] Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. [ 4 ] Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment, which may last for one or two days. [ 4 ] In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. [ 4 ] [ 20 ]\\nLyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. [ 21 ] [ 8 ] Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. [ 4 ] Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . [ 22 ] The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer . [ 23 ] People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). [ 24 ] PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease , a term no longer supported by scientists and used in different ways by different groups. [ 20 ] [ 25 ] Some healthcare providers claim that chronic Lyme is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment. [ 26 ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] , clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced, but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. [ 27 ] There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nSigns and symptoms [ edit ]\\nLyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms.\\n20% of Lyme rashes in the United States show a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" appearance. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]\\nErythema migrans (\\\"migrating redness\\\") on a woman's neck. [ 31 ] Rashes from non-Lyme causes may look similar. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]\\nThe incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). [ 34 ] Lyme symptoms most often occur from the month of May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases. [ 34 ]\\nEarly localized infection [ edit ]\\n80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit , groin , back of the knee , or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (median is 16 cm). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] [ 32 ]\\nThe rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. [ 4 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM) which translates as \\\"migrating redness.\\\" In about 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges possibly forming a \\\"bull's eye\\\" or \\\"target-like\\\" pattern, but this clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. [ 32 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. [ 4 ]\\nThe Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms. [ 4 ]\\nPeople with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis . [ 35 ]\\nNot everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms, and many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases. [ 36 ]\\nAsymptomatic infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States. [ 37 ] Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe. [ 38 ]\\nEarly disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nWithin days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the Borrelia bacteria may spread through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10–20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. [ 28 ] Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common. [ 28 ]\\nIn about 10–15% of untreated people, Lyme causes neurological problems known as neuroborreliosis . [ 39 ] Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4–6 weeks (range 1–12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy, and/or mononeuritis multiplex. [ 35 ] [ 40 ] Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. [ 41 ] After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms . Up to 76.5% of them present as tinnitus , the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness (53.7%) and hearing loss (16.7%) were the next most common symptoms. [ 42 ] In children, partial loss of vision may also occur. [ 35 ] Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves . When due to Lyme, it most typically causes facial palsy , impairing blinking, smiling, and chewing on one or both sides of the face. It may also cause intermittent double vision . [ 35 ] [ 41 ] Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness , numbness , or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots , e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. [ 39 ] [ 35 ] Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord , with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech , impaired movement , impaired motor planning , or shaking . [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn North America, facial palsy is the typical early neuroborreliosis presentation, occurring in 5–10% of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. [ 35 ] [ 44 ] Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. [ 45 ] In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome , accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. [ 40 ] [ 43 ] In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ] In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. [ 38 ] In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%). [ 40 ]\\nIn about 4–10% of untreated cases in the United States and 0.3–4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days to 7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness , fainting , shortness of breath , and chest pain . [ 46 ] Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches , facial palsy , headaches , or radicular pain . [ 46 ] In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis in 19–87% of people adversely impacts the heart's electrical conduction system, causing atrioventricular block that often manifests as heart rhythms that alternate within minutes between abnormally slow and abnormally fast. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 10–15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly , left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure. [ 46 ]\\nAnother skin condition, found in Europe but not in North America, is borrelial lymphocytoma , a purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum . [ 48 ]\\nLate disseminated infection [ edit ]\\nLyme arthritis caused this 3-year-old girl's knee to become swollen. Though painless, it did make her limp. [ 49 ]\\nLyme arthritis occurs in up to 60% of untreated people, typically starting about six months after infection. [ 28 ] It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip , other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint . [ 35 ] [ 50 ] Usually, large joint effusion and swelling occur, but only mild or moderate pain. [ 35 ] Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time, but periodically return. [ 35 ] Baker's cysts may form and rupture.\\n In early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and over time possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis that discovered poor documentation of this manifestation, experts wondered if it exists at all in the US or is merely very rare. [ 35 ] [ 51 ]\\nA neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia , a general sense of feeling unwell , and changes in personality. [ 52 ] Lyme encephalopathy is controversial in the US and has not been reported in Europe. [ 8 ] Problems such as depression and fibromyalgia are as common in people with Lyme disease as in the general population. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] There is no compelling evidence that Lyme disease causes psychiatric disorders, behavioral disorders (e.g. ADHD ), or developmental disorders (e.g. autism ). [ 55 ]\\nAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly. [ 48 ] It begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. [ 56 ] It is also associated with peripheral neuropathy. [ 51 ]\\nCause [ edit ]\\nMain article: Lyme disease microbiology\\nFurther information: Weather and climate effects on Lyme disease exposure\\nBorrelia bacteria, the causative agents of Lyme disease, magnified\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochetes , gram-negative bacteria from the genus Borrelia . Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella . [ 57 ] The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato , and show a great deal of genetic diversity . [ 58 ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato is a species complex made up of 20 accepted and three proposed genospecies. Eight species are known to cause Lyme disease: B. mayonii (found in North America), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (found in North America and Europe), B. afzelii , B. garinii, B. spielmanii, and B. lusitaniae (all found in Eurasia ). [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 16 ] [ 10 ] Some studies have also proposed that B. valaisiana may sometimes infect humans, but this species does not seem to be an important cause of disease. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]\\nTick life cycle [ edit ]\\nDeer tick life cycle\\nIxodes scapularis , the primary vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America\\nThree stages occur in the life cycle of a tick - larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and are usually most active in late spring and early summer in regions where the climate is mild. During the adult stage, Lyme disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and tend to be larger in size, so can be easily seen and removed. [ 63 ]\\nTransmission [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is classified as a zoonosis , as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts . [ 64 ] Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia ). [ 65 ] Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage , because they are very small, thus may feed for long periods of time undetected. [ 64 ] Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. [ 66 ] Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. [ 67 ] The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected. [ 68 ] Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Borrelia from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse , and occasionally birds. [ 69 ] Areas where Lyme is common are expanding. [ 70 ]\\nWithin the tick midgut, the Borrelia ' s outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the Borrelia downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection. [ 71 ] Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC. [ 72 ]\\nTick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. [ 73 ]\\nWhile B. burgdorferi is most associated with ticks hosted by white-tailed deer and white-footed mice , Borrelia afzelii is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto . The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association. [ 74 ]\\nBudding research has suggested that B. burgdorferi sensu lato may also be able to form enzootic cycle among lizard populations; [ 75 ] this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations of lizards, such as California. Except for one study in Europe, [ 74 ] much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia , it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific. [ 79 ]\\nTick Ixodes ricinus , developmental stages\\nIn Europe, the main vector is Ixodes ricinus , which is also called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. [ 80 ] In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector. [ 81 ] In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) is the main vector on the East Coast. [ 68 ]\\nThe lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as Texas , is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes , [ 82 ] though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness , which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease. [ 83 ]\\nOn the West Coast of the United States , the main vector is the western black-legged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ). [ 84 ] The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the western fence lizard that are resistant to Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West. [ 85 ] [ 79 ]\\nTransmission can occur across the placenta during pregnancy and as with a number of other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ]\\nThere is no scientific evidence to support Lyme disease transmission via blood transfusion, sexual contact, or breast milk. [ 90 ]\\nTick-borne co-infections [ edit ]\\nMain article: Tick-borne disease\\nTicks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other microbes, such as Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. [ 91 ] Among people with early Lyme disease, depending on their location, 2–12% will also have HGA and 2–10% will have babesiosis. [ 55 ] Ticks in certain regions also transmit viruses that cause tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan virus disease . [ 92 ] [ 55 ] Co-infections of Lyme disease may not require additional treatment, since they may resolve on their own or—as in the case of HGA—can be treated with the doxycycline prescribed for Lyme. [ 35 ] Persistent fever or compatible anomalous laboratory findings may be indicative of a co-infection. [ 55 ]\\nPathophysiology [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. [ 72 ] [ 93 ] B. Burgdorferi does not produce toxins. [ 94 ] Therefore, many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to spirochete in those tissues. [ 95 ]\\nB. burgdorferi is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. [ 96 ] Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. [ 97 ] This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis . The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. [ 72 ] Neutrophils , however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body. [ 98 ]\\nDays to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete. [ 99 ]\\nIf untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. [ 100 ] The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement , and hiding in the extracellular matrix , which may interfere with the function of immune factors. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]\\nImmunological studies [ edit ]\\nExposure to the Borrelia bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging inflammatory response , [ 103 ] a form of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease. [ 104 ] The production of this reaction might be due to a form of molecular mimicry , where Borrelia avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]\\nChronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever , but its wider application is controversial. [ 107 ] [ 108 ]\\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash, facial palsy , or arthritis ), history of possible exposure to infected ticks , and possibly laboratory tests . [ 4 ] [ 28 ] People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1–2 months. [ 35 ] Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common , within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull's eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms. [ 4 ] [ 111 ] In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota , but it is expanding into other areas. [ 70 ] Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk. [ 112 ]\\nIn the absence of an EM rash or history of tick exposure, Lyme diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation. [ 65 ] [ 113 ] The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time-consuming to grow in the laboratory. [ 4 ] [ 65 ] The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. [ 114 ] A positive antibody test result does not by itself prove active infection but can confirm an infection that is suspected because of symptoms, objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. [ 65 ] Because as many as 5–20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be tested for Lyme antibodies: a positive result would likely be false, possibly causing unnecessary treatment. [ 35 ] [ 40 ]\\nIn some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available. [ 44 ] [ 115 ]\\nLaboratory testing [ edit ]\\nTests for antibodies in the blood by ELISA and Western blot is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. [ 116 ] The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2–4 weeks and 4–6 weeks, and peak at 6–8 weeks. [ 117 ] When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. [ 35 ] Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. [ 117 ] A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false-positive result. [ 118 ] The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4–6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years. [ 117 ]\\nOther tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii and almost always involves lymphocytic pleocytosis , i.e. the densities of lymphocytes (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. [ 35 ] [ 43 ] Demonstration by lumbar puncture and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans , which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). [ 40 ] In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative. [ 119 ] American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat. [ 43 ] In infection involving the PNS, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment. [ 41 ]\\nIn Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography may show myocardial dysfunction. [ 46 ] Biopsy and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure. [ 46 ]\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material ( DNA ) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia . PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. [ 121 ] [ 40 ] Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during infection. [ 122 ] [ 40 ] Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid. [ 123 ] Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people. [ 40 ]\\nSeveral other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. OspA antigens , shed by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. [ 124 ] The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years. [ 127 ]\\nThe CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of B. burgdorferi , and lymphocyte transformation tests. [ 122 ]\\nImaging [ edit ]\\nNeuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis , but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. [ 128 ] Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vasculitis and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease , which makes them questionable. [ 129 ]\\nDifferential diagnosis [ edit ]\\nCommunity clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23–28% of erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. [ 113 ] EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites , cellulitis , or shingles . [ 113 ] Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull's eye. [ 4 ] Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2–3 cm/day and a diameter of at least 5 cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. [ 28 ] [ 32 ] Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). [ 28 ] [ 4 ] Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. [ 28 ] [ 4 ] EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee. [ 28 ] Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve's dermatome , and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. [ 130 ]\\nFacial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy . [ 44 ] Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. [ 44 ] Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. [ 44 ] Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. [ 44 ] Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. [ 44 ]\\nUnlike viral meningitis , Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur. [ 41 ] [ 35 ] Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy , or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF . [ 35 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the limbs is often misdiagnosed as a radiculopathy caused by nerve root compression, such as sciatica . [ 113 ] [ 131 ] Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4–6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating risks of other possible causes that, although less frequent, require immediate diagnosis and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. [ 132 ] A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms of lymphocytic meningitis, or facial palsy would lead to suspicion of Lyme disease and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation. [ 132 ]\\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and acute coronary syndrome . [ 45 ] [ 113 ] Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new \\\"great imitator\\\". [ 133 ] As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms. [ 134 ]\\nPrevention [ edit ]\\nTick bites may be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. [ 135 ] [ 9 ]\\nMost Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. [ 28 ] [ 135 ] Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands , shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. [ 28 ] [ 136 ] Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. [ 137 ] Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\\\"quest\\\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. [ 138 ] In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. [ 137 ] Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. [ 137 ] [ 135 ] In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. [ 137 ] Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. [ 137 ] [ 139 ] Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. [ 136 ]\\nAs a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. [ 135 ] [ 140 ] Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. [ 141 ] After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). [ 141 ] Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. [ 139 ] Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. [ 139 ] Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. [ 142 ] Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. [ 140 ] Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. [ 140 ] [ 143 ]\\nThe EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET , picaridin , IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD) . [ 135 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. [ 140 ] The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. [ 145 ] Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. [ 145 ] Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. [ 140 ] [ 144 ] Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). [ 140 ] [ 135 ] If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. [ 140 ] Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. [ 140 ]\\nAfter coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. [ 135 ] Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or warm dryer are not enough). [ 135 ] Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduce risk of infection. [ 135 ] Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister . [ 146 ] The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair. [ 135 ]\\nTick removal [ edit ]\\nRemoval of a tick using tweezers\\nAttached ticks should be removed promptly. Risk of infection increases with time of attachment, but in North America risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. [ 147 ] CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from the skin without twisting, jerking, squeezing or crushing the tick. [ 148 ] After tick removal, any tick parts remaining in the skin should be removed with a clean tweezer, if possible. [ 148 ] The wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. [ 148 ] The tick may be disposed by placing it in a container with alcohol, sealed bag, tape or flushed down the toilet. [ 148 ] The bitten person should write down where and when the bite happened so that this can be informed to a doctor if the person gets a rash or flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. [ 148 ] CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it. [ 148 ]\\nIn Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. [ 149 ] Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. [ 149 ] Another method consists in using about 20 cm of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]\\nPreventive antibiotics [ edit ]\\nThe risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. [ 28 ] It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. [ 28 ] If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70–80% of people infected). [ 4 ] [ 28 ]\\nGarden landscaping [ edit ]\\nSeveral landscaping practices may reduce the risk of tick bites in residential yards. [ 146 ] [ 152 ] These include keeping lawns mown, removing leaf litter and weeds and avoiding the use of ground cover. [ 146 ] A 3-ft-wide rock or woodchip barrier is recommended to separate lawns from wood piles, woodlands , stone walls and shrubs. [ 152 ] Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it to kill ticks. [ 152 ] A sun-exposed tick-safe zone at least 9 ft from the barrier should concentrate human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. [ 152 ] Materials such as wood decking, concrete, bricks, gravel or woodchips used on the ground under patios and playgrounds would discourage ticks there. [ 146 ] An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone. [ 152 ] [ 146 ]\\nOccupational exposure [ edit ]\\nOutdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active. [ 155 ]\\nHost animals [ edit ]\\nTicks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards , birds , mice , cats , dogs , deer , cattle and humans . The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \\\"dilution hosts\\\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and so decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. White-tailed deer are both a food source and a \\\"reproductive host\\\", where ticks tend to mate. [ 156 ] The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. Availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted. [ 157 ]\\nIn the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine , [ 158 ] and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. [ 159 ] Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. [ 160 ] While these studies have found these effects, other studies have found opposite effects. A study done in Massachusetts removed deer and did not see a significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. [ 161 ] Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to effectively control tick populations. [ 162 ] One study summarized the results of multiple studies all looking at deer reduction controlling tick populations and determined that deer control can't be used as a standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that since most of the studies looking at this are not good representatives of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. [ 163 ] There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen, would decrease Lyme disease risk the most. [ 164 ]\\nOthers have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not Borrelia burgdorferi reservoirs. This is because it was found that white-tailed deer blood actually kills the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. [ 165 ] Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks , may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission. [ 157 ]\\nTick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. [ 166 ] They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals through the use of acaricides has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on a number of grounds. Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment. [ 167 ]\\nIn Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). [ 168 ] These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. [ 168 ] \\\"The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus ; [ 169 ] \\\" it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi \\\" thought Jaenson & al. (1992) [ 170 ] (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, [ 171 ] as red deer and wild boars ( Sus scrofa ), [ 169 ] in which one Rickettsia and three Borrelia species were identified\\\", [ 169 ] with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. [ 172 ] Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe \\\" two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified \\\". [ 169 ]\\nVaccination [ edit ]\\nAs of 2023 [update] no human vaccines for Lyme disease were available. [ 27 ] The only human vaccine to advance to market was LYMErix, which was available from 1998, but discontinued in 2002. [ 173 ] The vaccine candidate VLA15 was scheduled to start a phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2022, with other research ongoing. Multiple vaccines are available for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\\nLYMErix [ edit ]\\nThe vaccine LYMErix was available from 1998 to 2002. The recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, was developed by SmithKline Beecham . In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine was found to confer protective immunity to Lyme disease in 76% of adults after three doses with only mild or moderate and transient adverse effects . [ 174 ] [ 175 ] On 21 December 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix on the basis of these trials for persons of ages 15 through 70. [ 175 ] [ 173 ]\\nFollowing approval of the vaccine , its entry into clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. [ 176 ] Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline , alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints. [ 177 ]\\nDespite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, [ 178 ] in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. [ 177 ] [ 179 ] The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a \\\"cautionary tale\\\"; [ 179 ] an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which \\\"unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.\\\" [ 180 ] The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told Nature : \\\"This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.\\\" [ 177 ] [ 181 ]\\nVLA15 [ edit ]\\nThe hexavalent (OspA) protein subunit-based vaccine candidate VLA15 was developed by Valneva . It was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017. [ 182 ] [ 183 ] In April 2020 Pfizer paid $130 million for the rights to the vaccine, and the companies are developing it together, performing multiple phase 2 trials. [ 184 ]\\nA phase 3 trial of VLA15 was scheduled for late 2022, recruiting volunteers at test sites located across the northeastern United States and in Europe. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Participants were scheduled to receive an initial three-dose series of vaccines over the course of five to nine months, followed by a booster dose after twelve months, with both the initial series and the booster dose scheduled to be complete before the year's peak Lyme disease season. [ 186 ]\\nOther research [ edit ]\\nAn mRNA vaccine designed to cause a strong fast immune response to tick saliva allowed the immune system to detect and remove the ticks from test animals before they were able to transmit the infectious bacteria. [ 187 ] The vaccine contains mRNAs for the body to build 19 proteins in tick saliva which, by enabling quick development of erythema (itchy redness) at the bite site, protects guinea pigs against Lyme disease. It also protected the test animals if the tick is not removed if only one tick, but not three, remain attached. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\\nCanine vaccines [ edit ]\\nCanine vaccines have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet- Schering-Plough 's vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA . The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial , generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog. [ 190 ]\\nTreatment [ edit ]\\nAntibiotics are the primary treatment. [ 4 ] [ 28 ] The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. [ 28 ] For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. [ 28 ] People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns . [ 35 ] Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; [ 28 ] alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , and azithromycin . [ 28 ] Azithromycin is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. [ 35 ] The standard treatment for cellulitis , cephalexin , is not useful for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , as these are effective against both infections. [ 35 ] Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy , radiculopathy , meningitis , or peripheral neuropathy . [ 28 ] Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; [ 28 ] cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives. [ 28 ]\\nTreatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7–14 days in early localized disease, to 14–21 days in early disseminated disease to 14–28 days in late disseminated disease. [ 55 ] Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. [ 120 ] In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone . [ 120 ] Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. [ 28 ] [ 35 ] Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no evidence shows it to be effective. [ 28 ] [ 191 ] IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. [ 28 ] As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. [ 28 ]\\nFacial palsy may resolve without treatment: however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. [ 35 ] Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. [ 44 ] In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. [ 44 ] [ 192 ]\\nAbout a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. [ 46 ] Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids. [ 46 ]\\nPeople with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping should use crutches. [ 193 ] Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [ 35 ] Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. [ 35 ] [ 193 ] People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for Borrelia DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. [ 35 ] [ 55 ] [ 193 ] Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy , or physical therapy. [ 55 ] [ 193 ]\\nPeople receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it . [ 115 ]\\nPrognosis [ edit ]\\nLyme disease's typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. [ 4 ] However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues. [ 35 ]\\nPeople who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. [ 113 ] Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64–71% at end of treatment for EM rash to about 84–90% after 30 months; higher percentages are reported in Europe. [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Treatment failure, i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. [ 194 ] Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g. joint or muscle pains or fatigue . [ 196 ] These symptoms are usually mild and nondisabling. [ 196 ]\\nPeople treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits, in addition to subjective symptoms. [ 35 ] In Europe, an average of 32–33 months after initial Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14–21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with only an EM rash (16%). [ 197 ] In another European study, 5 years after treatment for neuroborreliosis lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter were less common among those treated within 30 days of the first symptom (16%) than among those treated later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated. [ 198 ]\\nSome data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] However, in Europe 41% of people treated for facial palsy had other lingering symptoms at followup up to 6 months later, including 28% with numbness or altered sensation and 14% with fatigue or concentration problems. [ 200 ] Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. [ 199 ] [ 201 ] Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another one is voluntarily moved) can become evident only 6–12 months after facial palsy appears to be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. [ 202 ] Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. [ 202 ] In longer-term follow-up, 16–23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover. [ 202 ]\\nIn Europe, about a quarter of people with Bannwarth syndrome (Lyme radiculopathy and lymphocytic meningitis ) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3–6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection in cerebrospinal fluid ; after 12 months, 64% recovered fully, 31% had nondisabling mild or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or required substantial use of analgesics. [ 43 ] The most common lingering nondisabling symptoms were headache, fatigue , altered sensation , joint pains , memory disturbances, malaise , radicular pain , sleep disturbances, muscle pains , and concentration disturbances. Lingering disabling symptoms included facial palsy and other impaired movement . [ 43 ]\\nRecovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage. [ 35 ]\\nAbout half the people with Lyme carditis progress to complete heart block , but it usually resolves in a week. [ 46 ] Other Lyme heart conduction abnormalities resolve typically within 6 weeks. [ 46 ] About 94% of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). [ 46 ] Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. [ 46 ] However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal. [ 46 ]\\nRecommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several months for inflammation to resolve and a second round of antibiotics is often necessary. [ 35 ] Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9–14 months (range 4 months – 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery. [ 193 ]\\nReinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6–11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. [ 194 ] The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain. [ 203 ]\\nPost-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [ edit ]\\nChronic symptoms like pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment are experienced by 5–20% of people who contract Lyme disease, even after completing treatment. This is called Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. [ 24 ] [ 204 ]\\nThe cause is unknown. One hypothesis is that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains. However, human and animal trials have not provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. [ 205 ] Another hypothesis is that autoimmunity has been triggered by the infection. Auto–immune responses are known to occur following other infections, including Campylobacter ( Guillain-Barré syndrome ), Chlamydia (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease). A third hypothesis is that debris from \\na previous infection could remain. [ 205 ]\\nAnother hypothesis is that symptoms are simply unrelated to a Lyme infection. [ 206 ] [ 207 ] In studies of people who presented to clinics with concerns about Lyme disease, 47 to 80% had no evidence of Lyme infection while 15 to 55% (median 34%) were able to obtain other diagnoses. [ 205 ]\\nThere is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective in early Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotics are not. They have been shown ineffective in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and is similar to the management of fibromyalgia or ME/CFS . PTLDS usually gets better over time, but recovery may take many months. [ 206 ]\\nEpidemiology and prevalence [ edit ]\\nCountries with reported Lyme disease cases\\nOverview [ edit ]\\nLyme disease occurs regularly in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. [ 208 ]\\nLyme disease effects are comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds.\\n An estimated 476,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated for the disease in the United States. This number is probably an overestimate due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated in Europe. [ 8 ] [ 4 ] [ 209 ]\\nThere is a suggestion that tick populations and Lyme disease occurrence are increasing and spreading into new areas, owing in part to the warming temperatures of climate change . [ 210 ] However, tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. [ 157 ] [ 211 ]\\nNorth America [ edit ]\\nMany studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of I. scapularis projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S. [ 212 ] A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. [ 213 ] The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology . [ 213 ]\\nUnited States [ edit ]\\nCDC map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the Northeast Megalopolis and western Wisconsin\\nLyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ]\\nAlthough Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). [ 90 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria has been modified multiple times. [ 219 ] The 2022 surveillance case definition classifies cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect. [ 220 ] The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.\\n The CDC emphasizes that, while surveillance data has limitations, it is useful due to \\\"uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness.\\\" While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted. [ 221 ] [ 90 ]\\nSeveral similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), also known as Masters disease. Amblyomma americanum , known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment. [ 222 ]\\nIn recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever. [ 218 ]\\nCanada [ edit ]\\nThe range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. [ 112 ] [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] A model-based prediction by Leighton et al. (2012) suggests that the range of the I. scapularis tick will expand into Canada by 46 km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread. [ 226 ]\\nEurope [ edit ]\\nIn Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete B. burgdorferi sensu lato , mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus . [ 227 ] Cases of B. burgdorferi sensu lato -infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. [ 228 ] The number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. [ 229 ] Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising. [ 230 ] Lyme disease is rare in Iceland. On average around 6 to 7 cases are diagnosed every year, primarily localised infections presenting as erythema migrans. None of the cases had a definitive Icelandic origin and the yearly number of cases has not been increasing. [ 231 ]\\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\\nIn the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986 [ 232 ] when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Ireland combined. [ 233 ] In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, [ 234 ] but 973 in 2009 [ 232 ] and 953 in 2010. [ 235 ] Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010. [ 236 ]\\nIt is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year [ 235 ] (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas [ 232 ] ), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 \\\"to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor.\\\" [ 237 ] [ 238 ]\\nDespite Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi infection) being a notifiable disease in Scotland [ 239 ] since January 1990 [ 240 ] which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. [ 241 ] Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. [ 232 ]\\nAlthough there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest , Salisbury Plain , Exmoor , the South Downs , parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire , Thetford Forest [ 242 ] and the West coast and islands of Scotland, [ 243 ] infected ticks are widespread and can even be found in the parks of London. [ 234 ] [ 244 ] A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive , as were between 2% and 4–5% of the general local population of the area. [ 245 ] [ 246 ]\\nTests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] It is speculated that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. [ 249 ] However no published research has proven this to be so.\\nSouth America [ edit ]\\nIn Brazil, Lyme disease is not considered endemic. [ 250 ] A Lyme-like disease known as Baggio–Yoshinari syndrome has been described, attributed to microorganisms that do not belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted by ticks of the Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera. [ 251 ] The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia , São Paulo. [ 252 ] A 2024 analysis concluded that evidence to connect BYS to Borrelia bacteria was lacking. [ 250 ]\\nMexico [ edit ]\\nA 2007 study suggests Borrelia burgdorferi infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000. [ 253 ]\\nAfrica [ edit ]\\nIn northern Africa, B. burgdorferi sensu lato has been identified in Morocco , Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia . [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ]\\nLyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this region. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of Lyme infection in Africa. [ 257 ] In East Africa, two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya . [ 258 ] According The Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa, Lyme disease is not known to be endemic in either South Africa or Mozambique. [ 259 ]\\nAsia [ edit ]\\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato -infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China, Nepal , Thailand and far eastern Russia. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Borrelia has also been isolated in Mongolia . [ 262 ]\\nAustraliasia [ edit ]\\nLyme disease is not considered endemic to Australia. [ 263 ] While there have been reports of people acquiring Lyme disease in Australia, and even evidence of closely related Borrelia species in ticks, [ 264 ] the evidence linking these cases to local transmission is limited. Ongoing research on resolving potential Borrelia species to Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT) in Australia are ongoing. [ 265 ]\\nEtymology [ edit ]\\nLyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut . [ 266 ]\\nHistory [ edit ]\\nEarly evidence [ edit ]\\nThe earliest known evidence of Lyme disease was found in Oetzi , a 5300 year old mummy in the Eastern Alps near the Italian border. [ 267 ] \\nThe evolutionary history of Borrelia burgdorferi genetics has been examined by scientists. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the mid-west that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. [ 268 ]\\nJohn Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663 to 1670, wrote \\\"there be infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\\\" [ 269 ]\\nThis is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm , a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus , and who found the forests of New York \\\"abound\\\" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. [ 270 ]\\nPerhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. [ 271 ] He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \\\"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\\\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \\\"worm\\\" with a body which is \\\"of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\\\" that \\\"penetrates the skin\\\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. [ 272 ]\\nThe examination of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. [ 270 ] The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman , a 5,300-year-old mummy , revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. [ 273 ]\\nThe early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau , Germany (now Wrocław , Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who for 16 years had had a degenerative skin disorder now known as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans . [ 274 ]\\nAt a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion erythema migrans . [ 274 ] The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911. [ 275 ]\\nModern history [ edit ]\\nThe modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult. [ 276 ]\\nNeurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. [ 277 ] In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.\\n Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. [ 278 ] Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. [ citation needed ] Starting in 1946, facilities in Sweden experimented with treating EM rashes with substances known to kill spirochetes. [ 279 ] Einar Hollström  [ sv ] reported that \\\"penicillin was found to be the most effective.\\\" [ 280 ] In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. [ 281 ] In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe. [ 282 ] [ 283 ]\\nIn 1970 a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin. [ 284 ]\\nThe full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme , which gave the disease its popular name. [ 285 ] This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service , and by others from Yale University , including Stephen Malawista , who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. [ 286 ] The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that \\\"Lyme arthritis\\\" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe. [ 287 ]\\nBefore 1976, the elements of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius's disease, [ 288 ] Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, [ 289 ] [ 290 ] Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis. [ 291 ] [ 292 ]\\nIn 1980, Steere, et al. , began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. [ 293 ] In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer , a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory , with collections of I. dammini [ scapularis ] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed \\\"poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.\\\" Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the \\\"long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.\\\" Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour \\\"offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.\\\" Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. [ 294 ] In June 1982, he published his findings in Science , and the spirochete was named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor. [ 295 ]\\nAfter the identification of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics , amoxicillin , cefuroxime axetil , intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone . [ 296 ] [ 297 ] The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands. [ 298 ]\\nSociety, culture, and controversy [ edit ]\\nLandscape changes and urbanization [ edit ]\\nUrbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents—the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector , the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. [ 301 ]\\nThe dilution effect [ edit ]\\nGiven these habitat-host dynamics, in 2003 some researchers began to postulate whether the so called dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease. [ 299 ] The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that an increase in host biodiversity will result in a decrease in the number of vectors infected with B. burgdorferi . [ 299 ] Scientific research has shown that nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) decreases as the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect. [ 299 ] That said, there is no direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven. [ 299 ] Additionally, as of 2018, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates [ 302 ]\\nChronic Lyme disease [ edit ]\\nMain article: Chronic Lyme disease\\nThe term \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, [ 303 ] and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. [ 35 ] [ 120 ] [ 304 ] Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with B. burgdorferi or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing non-specific symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease. [ 305 ]\\nThe 2008 documentary Under Our Skin is known for promoting controversial and unrecognized theories about \\\"chronic Lyme disease\\\". [ 306 ]\\nConspiracy theories about origins [ edit ]\\nProlific but unfounded conspiracy theories have alleged that Lyme disease was a biological weapon that originated in the Plum Island laboratory , which is near Old Lyme, Connecticut. [ 307 ] A discredited 2004 book entitled Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory fueled the conspiracy theories. [ 308 ] [ 309 ] Archived specimens show that Lyme disease was endemic well before the establishment of Plum Island laboratory. [ 307 ] Additionally, Lyme disease was never a topic of research at Plum Island, according to the US Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture. [ 310 ] [ 308 ]\\nIn 2024 and 2025, conspiracy theories about the origins of Lyme disease were further spread due to attention from Robert F. Kennedy Jr . [ 311 ]\\nOther animals [ edit ]\\nDogs [ edit ]\\nPrevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step. [ 312 ]\\nAnother crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes ( Amitraz ), phenylpyrazoles ( Fipronil ), or permethrin ( pyrethroids ). [ 313 ] These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. [ 312 ] Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos. [ 313 ]\\nExamination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears. [ 314 ]\\nIn dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, [ 315 ] which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. [ 190 ] Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. [ 316 ] [ verification needed ] In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs. [ 317 ]\\nCats [ edit ]\\nUnlike dogs, it is very rare for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with B. burgdorferi , following a bite from an infected tick. Cats who are infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including but not limited to lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. [ 318 ] In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans. [ 319 ] However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be asymptomatic , and show no noticeable signs of the disease. [ 319 ] [ 318 ] Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required. [ 318 ]\\nHorses [ edit ]\\nLyme disease in horses is often challenging to diagnose because symptoms vary widely. Common acute symptoms include weight loss, fever, lameness , ataxia , and other muscle and joint-related issues. [ 320 ] [ 321 ] [ 322 ] Additional symptoms include muscle tenderness, swollen joints, arthritis , and neck stiffness. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] Chronic symptoms of the disease typically include neurological manifestations, such as meningitis , cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis , and encephalitis . [ 326 ] [ 320 ] [ 327 ] [ 328 ] Furthermore, it is important to note that some horses do not slow clinical signs of Lyme disease. [ 329 ]\\nThere are three main testing strategies used to diagnose horses with Lyme disease. They include clinical evaluation, serological testing , and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. [ 330 ] [ 331 ] [ 321 ] Detection of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine Lyme disease and unspecific testing for antibodies is not recommended. [ 332 ]\\nTypical treatment involves antibiotics such as oxytetracycline , doxycycline , ceftriaxone , or minocycline . [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 329 ] In some cases, a combination of antibiotics may be administered. Doxycycline and minocycline are taken orally, while oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are usually administered intravenously. [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 329 ] The duration and dosage of treatment vary widely among cases. In most cases, the infected horse is euthanized . [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 327 ] [ 336 ] Death of horses as a result of Borrelia burgdorferi infection remains unknown. [ 337 ]\\nCurrently, there is no approved Lyme disease vaccine for horses available. [ 338 ] However, a study demonstrated that ponies could be protected using an aluminum adjuvanted recombinant outer-surface protein A (rOspA) vaccine. [ 339 ] While horses have been administered a Lyme disease vaccine designed for dogs, it elicits only a short-lasting antibody response. [ 338 ] Another study supports the use of commercial Lyme disease vaccines, showing that they do elicit an antibody response, which can be significantly enhanced when horses receive an additional booster vaccine.

Compared to non-immunized guinea pigs, vaccinated animals exposed to infected ticks quickly developed redness at the tick bite site. None of the immunized animals developed Lyme disease if ticks were removed when redness developed. In contrast, about half of the control group became infected with B. burgdorferi after tick removal. When a single infected tick was attached to immunized guinea pigs and not removed, none of vaccinated animals were infected compared to 60 percent of control animals. However, protection waned in immunized guinea pigs if three ticks remained attached to the animal. Ticks in immunized animals were unable to feed aggressively and dislodged more quickly than those on guinea pigs in the control group.\\n^ Sajid A, Matias J, Arora G, Kurokawa C, DePonte K, Tang X, et al.

In the United States, the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the primary vector, particularly in the northeastern and north-central regions. In Europe, Ixodes ricinus serves as the main vector. Lyme disease is the most commonly transmitted tick-borne illness in the U.S. and poses serious health risks if not properly diagnosed and treated.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can manifest in multiple stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:**\\n   - Characterized by the appearance of an expanding rash known as erythema migrans (EM), which typically develops within 3 to 30 days following a tick bite. The rash may resemble a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - If untreated, the infection may spread to other body areas. Symptoms in this stage can include additional rashes, facial paralysis (such as Bell's palsy), severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - This stage may occur months to years after the initial infection, leading to chronic manifestations such as arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological problems, often collectively referred to as Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is primarily caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and related species. The pathophysiology of Lyme disease involves the following:\\n- The spirochete enters the skin at the tick bite site and migrates locally, spreading through the lymphatics and bloodstream to various organs. \\n- The host's immune response leads to inflammation and tissue damage in the heart, nervous system, and joints.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis typically involves a combination of:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Identifying characteristic symptoms and confirming recent tick exposure, particularly the presence of EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Serological tests are employed to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy that consists of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a Western blot for confirmation.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment regimen for Lyme disease is contingent upon its stage:\\n- **Early Stage:** Oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective and are typically administered for 10 to 28 days, depending on the specific case.\\n- **Neurological or Cardiac Involvement:** Intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone may be required, depending on the severity of the symptoms.\\n- **Late Stage or Arthritis:** A longer course of antibiotics is often necessary for addressing Lyme arthritis or chronic symptoms.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention measures focus on minimizing exposure to ticks:\\n- Use insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wear protective clothing (long sleeves and pants) in tick-prone areas.\\n- Conduct body checks for ticks after outdoor activities.\\n- Apply acaricides in residential areas where ticks are prevalent.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is predominantly found in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in temperate regions. The incidence of the disease has significantly increased, correlating with rising tick populations due to environmental factors, wildlife management changes, and urbanization. In 2022, over 62,000 cases were officially reported in the U.S., representing a growing public health challenge.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease remains a significant public health concern with varying potential impacts on health. Understanding its transmission pathways, clinical presentation, and treatment options is vital for effective management and preventing severe long-term health complications related to the disease.\\n\\n## References\\n1.

In Europe, the primary vector is Ixodes ricinus.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nThe presentation of Lyme disease symptoms typically occurs in stages:\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:** \\n   - The most distinctive sign is an expanding rash called erythema migrans (EM), which usually appears 3–30 days after a tick bite. \\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n   \\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:** \\n   - If left untreated, the infection may spread to other body parts. Symptoms may include additional rashes, facial paralysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n   \\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:** \\n   - Occurring months to years after infection, potential chronic manifestations include arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological issues—often termed Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n### Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochete bacteria, particularly Borrelia burgdorferi and others. Diagnosis typically involves:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Based on symptoms and history of tick exposure, particularly identifying EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Utilizes serologic tests to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy (ELISA followed by Western blot).\\n\\n### Treatment\\nAntibiotic treatment is essential for Lyme disease and varies according to the stage of the disease:\\n- **Oral antibiotics** (e.g., doxycycline, amoxicillin) are generally effective for early-stage Lyme disease.\\n- **Intravenous antibiotics** (e.g., ceftriaxone) may be necessary for severe neurological involvement or Lyme carditis.\\nTypical treatment durations are from 14 to 28 days, depending on the stage and severity of the disease.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nPrevention strategies are aimed at reducing tick bites:\\n- Use of insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wearing protective clothing when in tick-infested areas.\\n- Conducting tick checks after outdoor activities.\\n- Applying acaricides in residential areas can reduce tick populations.\\n\\n### Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in temperate areas. The disease has seen a significant rise in cases, largely due to environmental factors such as wildlife management and urbanization changes affecting tick populations.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a significant public health concern with diverse and sometimes severe health implications.

In the United States, the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the primary vector, particularly in the northeastern and north-central regions. In Europe, Ixodes ricinus serves as the main vector. Lyme disease is the most commonly transmitted tick-borne illness in the U.S. and poses serious health risks if not properly diagnosed and treated.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can manifest in multiple stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:**\\n   - Characterized by the appearance of an expanding rash known as erythema migrans (EM), which typically develops within 3 to 30 days following a tick bite. The rash may resemble a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - If untreated, the infection may spread to other body areas. Symptoms in this stage can include additional rashes, facial paralysis (such as Bell's palsy), severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - This stage may occur months to years after the initial infection, leading to chronic manifestations such as arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological problems, often collectively referred to as Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is primarily caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and related species. The pathophysiology of Lyme disease involves the following:\\n- The spirochete enters the skin at the tick bite site and migrates locally, spreading through the lymphatics and bloodstream to various organs. \\n- The host's immune response leads to inflammation and tissue damage in the heart, nervous system, and joints.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis typically involves a combination of:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Identifying characteristic symptoms and confirming recent tick exposure, particularly the presence of EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Serological tests are employed to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy that consists of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a Western blot for confirmation.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment regimen for Lyme disease is contingent upon its stage:\\n- **Early Stage:** Oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective and are typically administered for 10 to 28 days, depending on the specific case.\\n- **Neurological or Cardiac Involvement:** Intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone may be required, depending on the severity of the symptoms.\\n- **Late Stage or Arthritis:** A longer course of antibiotics is often necessary for addressing Lyme arthritis or chronic symptoms.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention measures focus on minimizing exposure to ticks:\\n- Use insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wear protective clothing (long sleeves and pants) in tick-prone areas.\\n- Conduct body checks for ticks after outdoor activities.\\n- Apply acaricides in residential areas where ticks are prevalent.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is predominantly found in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in temperate regions. The incidence of the disease has significantly increased, correlating with rising tick populations due to environmental factors, wildlife management changes, and urbanization. In 2022, over 62,000 cases were officially reported in the U.S., representing a growing public health challenge.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease remains a significant public health concern with varying potential impacts on health. Understanding its transmission pathways, clinical presentation, and treatment options is vital for effective management and preventing severe long-term health complications related to the disease.\\n\\n## References\\n1.

Most commonly, the disease is transmitted by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in the northeastern and north-central United States. In Europe, the primary vector is Ixodes ricinus.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nThe presentation of Lyme disease symptoms typically occurs in stages:\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:** \\n   - The most distinctive sign is an expanding rash called erythema migrans (EM), which usually appears 3–30 days after a tick bite. \\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n   \\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:** \\n   - If left untreated, the infection may spread to other body parts. Symptoms may include additional rashes, facial paralysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n   \\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:** \\n   - Occurring months to years after infection, potential chronic manifestations include arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological issues—often termed Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n### Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochete bacteria, particularly Borrelia burgdorferi and others. Diagnosis typically involves:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Based on symptoms and history of tick exposure, particularly identifying EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Utilizes serologic tests to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy (ELISA followed by Western blot).\\n\\n### Treatment\\nAntibiotic treatment is essential for Lyme disease and varies according to the stage of the disease:\\n- **Oral antibiotics** (e.g., doxycycline, amoxicillin) are generally effective for early-stage Lyme disease.\\n- **Intravenous antibiotics** (e.g., ceftriaxone) may be necessary for severe neurological involvement or Lyme carditis.\\nTypical treatment durations are from 14 to 28 days, depending on the stage and severity of the disease.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nPrevention strategies are aimed at reducing tick bites:\\n- Use of insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wearing protective clothing when in tick-infested areas.\\n- Conducting tick checks after outdoor activities.\\n- Applying acaricides in residential areas can reduce tick populations.\\n\\n### Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in temperate areas. The disease has seen a significant rise in cases, largely due to environmental factors such as wildlife management and urbanization changes affecting tick populations.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a significant public health concern with diverse and sometimes severe health implications. Understanding its transmission, symptoms, and effective management strategies is crucial for both prevention and treatment.\\n\\n#### References:\\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Most commonly, the disease is transmitted by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in the northeastern and north-central United States. In Europe, the primary vector is Ixodes ricinus.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nThe presentation of Lyme disease symptoms typically occurs in stages:\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:** \\n   - The most distinctive sign is an expanding rash called erythema migrans (EM), which usually appears 3–30 days after a tick bite. \\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n   \\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:** \\n   - If left untreated, the infection may spread to other body parts. Symptoms may include additional rashes, facial paralysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n   \\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:** \\n   - Occurring months to years after infection, potential chronic manifestations include arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological issues—often termed Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n### Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochete bacteria, particularly Borrelia burgdorferi and others. Diagnosis typically involves:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Based on symptoms and history of tick exposure, particularly identifying EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Utilizes serologic tests to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy (ELISA followed by Western blot).\\n\\n### Treatment\\nAntibiotic treatment is essential for Lyme disease and varies according to the stage of the disease:\\n- **Oral antibiotics** (e.g., doxycycline, amoxicillin) are generally effective for early-stage Lyme disease.\\n- **Intravenous antibiotics** (e.g., ceftriaxone) may be necessary for severe neurological involvement or Lyme carditis.\\nTypical treatment durations are from 14 to 28 days, depending on the stage and severity of the disease.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nPrevention strategies are aimed at reducing tick bites:\\n- Use of insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wearing protective clothing when in tick-infested areas.\\n- Conducting tick checks after outdoor activities.\\n- Applying acaricides in residential areas can reduce tick populations.\\n\\n### Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in temperate areas. The disease has seen a significant rise in cases, largely due to environmental factors such as wildlife management and urbanization changes affecting tick populations.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a significant public health concern with diverse and sometimes severe health implications. Understanding its transmission, symptoms, and effective management strategies is crucial for both prevention and treatment.\\n\\n#### References:\\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Continuing Education Activity Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious condition transmitted through the bite of infected ticks, primarily caused by the spirochete bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi in the United States and various Borrelia species in Europe and Asia. This disease progresses through three stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late disease. Initial symptoms often include a characteristic \\\"bull's-eye\\\" rash (erythema migrans), fever, and fatigue. If left untreated, the infection can advance to affect multiple systems, potentially leading to neurological symptoms, cardiac complications, and arthritis. The late stage may present with chronic arthritis and encephalopathy, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Through this continuing education course, healthcare professionals gain valuable insights into the recognition of Lyme disease's clinical features and the implementation of appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies. The course emphasizes the importance of a 2-step serologic testing process for accurate diagnosis and highlights the benefits of early antibiotic intervention to prevent disease progression. Participants learn how to effectively collaborate with an interprofessional team, including specialists in infectious diseases, neurology, and rheumatology, to enhance patient management and outcomes. This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive care, addressing various aspects of the disease and its complications, ultimately leading to improved patient recovery and quality of life.\\nObjectives:\\nIdentify the early clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, including erythema migrans, fever, and fatigue, to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment. Screen patients with a history of tick exposure or characteristic symptoms for Lyme disease using a 2-step serologic testing process to confirm the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi or related species. Select appropriate follow-up care strategies to monitor patient progress and response to treatment, ensuring effective management of Lyme disease and its sequelae. Collaborate with an interprofessional team, including specialists in infectious diseases, neurology, and rheumatology, to enhance the management of complex cases of Lyme disease.\\nAccess free multiple choice questions on this topic.\\nIntroduction Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is the most commonly transmitted tick-borne infection in the United States (US) and among the most frequently diagnosed tick-borne infections worldwide. Lyme disease is divided into 3 stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late. Early localized disease is distinguished by the red ring-like expanding rash of erythema migrans at the site of a recent tick bite. Other symptoms experienced at this stage may be malaise, headache, fever, myalgia, and arthralgia. Most patients only experience the symptoms of early localized disease. About 20% of patients develop early disseminated disease, with the most common symptoms being multiple erythema migrans lesions. Other symptoms of the disseminated stage are flu-like symptoms, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, myalgia, palsies of the cranial nerves, especially of cranial nerve VII, ophthalmic conditions, and lymphocytic meningitis. Additionally, cardiac manifestations, including conduction abnormalities, myocarditis, or pericarditis, may occur. The most common late-stage manifestation is arthritis, which is usually pauciarticular and affects large joints, especially the knees. [1] [2]  Lyme disease is a curable condition if identified and treated appropriately. Etiology In the US, Lyme disease is caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi ( and rarely Borrelia mayonii)  and is transmitted by the bite of an Ixodes genus black-legged tick. In Europe and Asia, the predominant causes of Lyme disease are  B  burgdorferi ,  Borrelia  afzelii , and  Borrelia  garinii . [3] [4]  In Asia, B garinii is the most common cause of Lyme disease.  B burgdorferi has a particular affinity for joints, while  B garinii  has a predilection for nervous system tissue.  B afzelii has an affinity for the skin. In the US,  Borrelia spp are transmitted by ticks, with Ixodes scapularis  being the main vector in the Northeastern and upper Midwest regions and  Ixodes pacificus  in the Western region.  Ixodes ricinus  and  Ixodes persulcatus  are the main species in Europe and Asia, respectively.  The tick lifecycle is significant to understanding when they are infectious. They have a 2- to 3-year life span and cycle through 4 life stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult. The larva and nymph must take a blood meal to advance to the next life stage, and the female ticks require blood to reproduce. During these meals, ticks become infected with the bacteria. Ticks attach to an animal host reservoir, typically birds or other small mammals such as mice and voles, and feed anywhere from 3 to 7 days. While ticks can feed on any mammal, deer are not a natural reservoir of the spirochete. Those infected nymphs and adult ticks spread the bacteria each time they subsequently feed.  Epidemiology Lyme disease is most commonly reported in the Northeastern and upper Midwestern US regions. The primary states with endemic Lyme disease are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Sporadic cases have been reported in northern California, Oregon, and Washington. [5] [6] The infection tends to occur during late spring, summer, and early fall, coinciding with activity of the nymph feeding and more interaction of people in spaces that increase the risk for a tick bite. In 2022, 62,551 cases of Lyme disease in the US were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). cdc.gov/lyme Other estimates place the actual number of cases much higher. More men than women tend to be affected. The age distribution is bimodal, with more children younger than 15 and adults 45 and older affected. Lyme disease can affect people of all ethnic backgrounds, but most cases reported are in White individuals. Pathophysiology The Borrelia spirochete lives in the midgut of the tick. Once the tick feeds, blood from the affected host triggers the proliferation of the spirochetes and induces the spirochete to express a protein called outer surface protein C, which allows the spirochete to invade the tick salivary glands by moving from the midgut closer to the tick mouthpiece. This process takes time and varies by species of tick and spirochete, but it explains why transmission to human hosts requires a tick to be attached to the host for more than 15 hours in most cases. During transmission, the spirochetes are deposited in the skin and then disseminated from the site of inoculation to other areas of the body.  The infected host's innate and adaptive immune system triggers macrophage- and antibody-mediated killing of the spirochetes. In some cases, the immune system can clear the infection without evidence of developing disease. However, due to sophisticated mechanisms by the spirochete to evade the host immune response, the infection may persist and develop clinically evident disease. [7]  The host inflammatory response is responsible for causing tissue damage in organs, including the heart, nervous tissue, and joints. The spirochete itself is not known to be directly toxic. The pathophysiology of posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) is unclear. Several theories have been suggested, though no evidence has been reported to support the existence of chronic B burgdorferi infection. Some active pathology may be present after the initial clearance of the microbes, the persistence of inappropriate immune activation and inflammation, or some combination of both. No one leading proposal has been established, and more research is needed in this area. [8]   For patients who develop postinfectious Lyme arthritis, a complex interplay is proposed between bacterial and host factors. No active infection can be identified in these cases, yet there is objective evidence of ongoing inflammation of the joints. The persistence of bacterial debris may continue to trigger immune activation. Additionally, immune system overactivation by protein-specific bacteria is possible. [9] Histopathology\\nErythema Migrans\\nA biopsy of erythema migrans is not needed to establish a diagnosis. Erythema migrans histologic findings are nonspecific, usually showing a perivascular cellular infiltrate consisting of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Rarely are mast cells and neutrophils identified. A biopsy may show eosinophilic infiltrates, representing a local reaction to the bite. Spirochetes may be identified using antibody-labeled or silver stains but are typically rarely identified in skin specimens and should not be used as a basis for diagnosis.\\nAcrodermatitis Chronica Atrophicans\\nHistopathology is essential for the diagnosis of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, which may overlap and be confused clinically with morphea, mycosis fungicides, or lichen sclerosis. [10]  Interstitial granulomatous infiltrates, which are CD68-positive, are common, and CD3-positive lymphocytes are predominant. Histiocytes are also part of the infiltrates in all cases. Plasma cells may be seen rarely but can be visualized by staining for CD138. Thickened collagen bundles and band-like infiltrates of CD4 T cells are other common features. Interstitial fibroblasts are also reduced and can be seen by staining for CD34. [10]\\nBorrelial Lymphocytoma\\nHistologic examination is performed in patients with suspected  Borrelia  lymphocytoma when the history is unclear enough to support a diagnosis, but the histopathology is generally nonspecific. Evaluating for other causes of nodules and ruling out neoplasm can help. The biopsy tends to show a dense dermal polyclonal lymphocytic infiltrate with lymphoid follicles and pseudoterminal centers or a pseudolymphoma. [11] History and Physical Lyme disease is classified into 3 stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late. Approximately 1.6% to 7% of individuals may have an asymptomatic Lyme infection. [7]  In most cases, however, patients develop symptoms of Lyme disease, with erythema migrans being the most common initial manifestation. Erythema migrans is characteristic of early localized disease, occurring 1 to 2 weeks after a tick bite. Patients may develop early disseminated or late disease if the infection persists or goes untreated. Early disseminated disease is associated with neurologic and cardiac manifestations. Neurologic Lyme disease manifestations include facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) palsy, lymphocytic meningitis, or radiculopathy. Cardiac involvement may consist of myopericarditis and heart block. Lyme arthritis is typically a late disease manifestation and may be monoarticular or pauciarticular, generally involving large joints, most commonly the knee, and occurring months after the initial tick bite. [12]  Because the symptoms are not specific, clinicians should consider other conditions and infections transmitted by ticks (eg, coinfection with Babesia microti and Ehrlichia ). Coinfection has been reported in approximately 10% of patients.\\nEarly Localized Disease\\nThe early localized phase of Lyme disease may present with an erythema migrans rash and low-grade fever. This stage usually occurs within 1 to 28 days following the tick bite. The erythema migrans rash is seen in 70% of patients and may develop between 7 to 14 days following the tick bite. The uniform rash usually occurs at the tick bite site and may burn, itch, or be asymptomatic. The rash tends to expand for a few days, and concentric rings may be visible (see Image.  Lyme Disease \\\"Bulls-Eye\\\" Rash). If left untreated, the rash persists for 2 to 3 weeks and may expand to 20 cm in diameter. About 20% of patients may have recurrent episodes of the rash, and multiple lesions are not uncommon. At the same time, flu-like symptoms may be present. A low-grade fever may be associated with myalgia, neck stiffness, and headache. Visual problems include eye redness and tearing.\\nEarly Disseminated Disease\\nStage 2 is the early disseminated phase of the disease process. This stage usually develops 3 to 12 weeks after the initial infection. Features may include general malaise, fever, neurological symptoms (dizziness and headache), muscle pain, or cardiac symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and dyspnea). About 20% of patients have centrl nervous system involvement, including meningitis, cranial neuropathies, radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar symptoms, or rarely encephalomyelitis. Bell palsy affecting the facial nerve is seen in approximately 5% of patients. The classic triad includes meningitis, cranial neuropathy, and motor or sensory radiculoneuropathy, but these features may occur alone.  Cardiac involvement may present with arrhythmias or transient heart block. Conduction abnormalities are not uncommon, but most cases are isolated and rarely last more than a few days. Seldom does a patient require permanent pacing. Sporadic cases of sudden cardiac death have occurred due to fulminant carditis. Ocular manifestations have also been described, with conjunctivitis being the most common feature and keratitis, iridocyclitis, retinal vasculitis, optic neuropathy, and uveitis being rare. Borrelial lymphocytoma is a rare presentation of early Lyme disease reported mainly in Europe; this condition tends to occur weeks to several months after the initial infection. Borrelial lymphocytoma presents as a slow-growing, painless plaque or nodule, which is red-bluish in coloration and usually occurs on the ear lobe in children or the breast in adults. [11]  The lesion may resolve spontaneously.\\nLate Disease\\nLate-stage Lyme disease may occur months after the initial infection. The typical features include neurological and musculoskeletal involvement. Many patients may not have a history of erythema migrans. However, these individuals may present with sensory axonal polyneuropathy, encephalomyelitis, or mononeuropathy. Cognitive deficits are common. Encephalopathy presents with deficits in concentration, cognition, memory loss, and personality changes. Extreme irritability and depression are also common. Encephalomyelitis is rare and can present with ataxia, seizures, hemiparesis, autonomic dysfunction, and hearing loss. Lyme arthritis tends to affect large joints, especially the knee. Symptoms manifest as joint pain with swelling and stiffness. Smaller joints, such as the elbow, may be involved, and episodes of bursitis or tendinitis may occur. Over time, in most cases, symptoms tend to subside even without intervention. In a small proportion of patients with Lyme arthritis, chronic inflammatory arthritis similar to rheumatoid arthritis may develop. This complication of Lyme disease is termed postinfectious Lyme arthritis.  Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is typically seen in older women and tends to occur on the dorsum of the hands and feet. This rash presents as bluish-red discoloration with some swelling that progresses very slowly as an expansive lesion, leading the skin to become atrophic over time; this may occur years following the primary infection, has been described chiefly in European cohorts, and may be confused with morphea. Evaluation A challenge in evaluating Lyme disease is that many patients diagnosed with the disease often have no recollection of a tick bite or a rash. Symptoms may be vague in most patients, and testing is needed in those cases where Lyme disease is suspected as an underlying etiology. Therefore, the CDC recommends a 2-step serologic testing process using US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared assays.  Serologic testing is unreliable during the first few weeks of infection, given the time needed for seroconversion. Patients presenting with erythema migrans rash and a history of residing in or traveling to an endemic region of Lyme disease may be treated based on clinical findings. In later stages of the disease, the 2-step approach is recommended for the serologic diagnosis of Lyme disease. The first step is to perform a quantitative screening test for serum antibodies to B burgdorferi using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunofluorescent antibody assay. If this step is negative, no further testing is recommended. A Western blot should follow specimens with positive or equivocal results. Standard 2-tier testing uses EIA as the first step and Western blot as the 2nd step. According to the CDC, an immunoblot is positive if at least 2 of 3 bands are present on the immunoglobulin (Ig) IgM immunoblot within 30 days of symptom onset or 5 to 10 bands are present on the IgG immunoblot at any time. [13] Serologic diagnosis is greater than 80% sensitive for patients with neurologic or cardiac manifestations. [14] [15] [16] Sequential serological testing is not recommended in the acute state because antibody titers often remain elevated for a long time. Testing the tick is also not recommended. False positive results may occur in patients with other conditions, including syphilis, rheumatoid arthritis, relapsing fever, and Epstein-Barr infection.\\nSuspected Cardiac Manifestations\\nSerologic testing is recommended for patients presenting with acute myocarditis or pericarditis of unknown cause in an appropriate epidemiologic setting. Specific cardiac testing with a screening electrocardiogram is recommended for patients presenting with dyspnea, edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, chest pain, and syncope and living in a Lyme endemic area. For those presenting with more severe potential manifestations, including exercise intolerance, palpitations, presyncope, syncope, pericardial pain, evidence of pericardial effusion, elevated biomarkers, edema, shortness of breath, or evidence of PR interval prolongation  of more than 300 milliseconds, admission to the hospital for continuous electrocardiogram monitoring is recommended.\\nSuspected Neurologic Manifestations\\nTesting is recommended for patients presenting with meningitis, painful radiculoneuritis, mononeuropathy multiplex including confluent mononeuropathy multiplex, acute cranial neuropathies, or in patients with evidence of spinal cord or brain inflammation, and with epidemiologically plausible exposure to ticks infected with B burgdorferi . [17]\\nSuspected Arthritic Manifestations\\nJoint aspiration is only recommended if a clinician suspects inflammatory arthritis. When assessing possible Lyme arthritis, serum antibody testing is recommended over polymerase chain reaction or culture of blood, synovial fluid, or tissue. However, a polymerase chain reaction of the synovial fluid or tissue can be performed if the diagnosis remains under question despite positive Lyme serologies.  Treatment / Management\\nLyme Disease Management\\nLyme disease treatment is divided into the following categories:\\nAsymptomatic patients with potential exposure:  Asymptomatic children and adults with a known tick bite should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics of a single dose of oral doxycycline 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children if the tick bite was from any of the following: An identified Ixodes spp vector species Occurred in a highly endemic area The tick was attached for ≥36 hours  [17]\\nErythema migrans rash:  Patients with 1 or more classic appearing erythema migrans rash in an endemic area for Lyme disease should be treated without further testing. Oral antibiotic therapy should be used with a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil. Second-line therapy is 5 to 10 days of azithromycin for those patients intolerant of or allergic to the former antibiotics. [17]  To establish a diagnosis before antibiotic treatment, serologic testing is recommended for patients with an atypical rash but suggestive of erythema migrans.\\nNeurologic manifestations:  Intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G, or oral doxycycline is recommended over other antimicrobials for 14 to 21 days. IV is preferred, but choosing oral or IV antibiotics should be based on patient-specific factors such as tolerance, access, or risk for adverse effects. [17]\\nCardiac manifestations:  For patients with symptomatic heart block, a temporary pacemaker may be placed over a permanent pacemaker, as in most cases with antibiotic treatment, heart block is reversible. Oral doxycycline as an outpatient is sufficient for patients with Lyme carditis and mild symptoms. For patients with Lyme carditis and more severe manifestations requiring hospitalization and monitoring, IV ceftriaxone is preferred with a switch to an oral antibiotic as the patient clinically improves. A total of 14 to 21 days of antibiotics is recommended. [17]\\nArthritis:  Lyme arthritis should be treated with oral doxycycline for 28 days. A second course of oral antibiotics may be administered to those with a partial response. For those who have had minimal or no response, IV ceftriaxone for 2 to 4 weeks can be administered. [17]  For patients who have developed postantibiotic Lyme arthritis refractory to a course of oral and a course of IV antibiotics, referral to a rheumatologist for consideration of intra-articular corticosteroid injections, use of disease-modifying agents or other advanced therapies should be considered.\\nBorrelial lymphocytoma:  Oral antibiotic therapy for 14 days is recommended. [17]\\nAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans:  Oral antibiotic therapy for 21 to 28 days is recommended. [17]\\nPosttreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome\\nTen to 20% of patients with Lyme disease will not respond to treatment and can develop PTLDS after using antibiotics. [18]  For patients with no objective manifestations of Lyme disease, such as active rash, cardiac or neurologic findings, or arthritis, but with persistent or recurring nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, pain, or cognitive impairment following recommended treatment for Lyme disease, there is no evidence that additional antibiotic therapy confers any benefit. Patients are treated for symptom management. For arthralgia and myalgia, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, heating pads, and physical therapy may be used. For neurocognitive symptoms, cessation of any medications that may contribute to neurocognitive symptoms should be considered. These medications may include benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, antihistamines, and opioids. [8]  Referrals to rheumatology, neurology, physical rehabilitation, and psychiatry specialists may be helpful.\\nAntibiotic Refractory Lyme Arthritis\\nAbout 10% of patients with Lyme arthritis will experience persistent inflammatory arthritis that does not respond to 1 or more round of antibiotic treatments. If no evidence of persistent infection is identified, this manifestation may be called postinfectious Lyme arthritis. A referral to a rheumatologist is indicated for further evaluation and management.\\nSpecial Populations\\nDoxycycline is used in most patients except in young children and those who are pregnant. In children, amoxicillin remains the drug of choice. For patients older than 8 with early, localized disease, doxycycline is recommended for 10 days. Patients younger than 8 should receive amoxicillin or cefuroxime for 14 days to avoid the potential for tooth staining caused by tetracycline use in young children. [19] [20] [21] Clinicians should monitor patients for the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction when starting therapy, which involves a transient worsening of symptoms during the first 24 hours of treatment. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is a cytokine-driven reaction to the antibiotic-mediated destruction of spirochetes. This reaction is seen in 5% to 15% of patients and usually resolves within 1 to 2 days. Treatment should not be interrupted if this reaction occurs, but symptom therapy with acetaminophen and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be helpful.  Differential Diagnosis In patients with erythema migrans, a careful history and physical examination are primarily what is required to diagnose Lyme disease. However, many patients with Lyme disease present without erythema migrans, and the diagnosis becomes a challenge. In those cases, erythema migrans may never have occurred, may not have been recognized, or may not have been correctly diagnosed by the clinician. The differential diagnoses for Lyme disease considered are guided by the clinical manifestation observed, including: Erythema migrans : Aarthropod hypersensitivity reaction, Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), cellulitis, erysipelas, erythema multiforme, tinea, nummular eczema, granuloma annular, contact dermatitis, urticaria, fixed drug eruption, pityriasis rosea, parvovirus B19 infection, dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus Neuroborreliosis : Other causes of facial palsy, viral meningitis, mechanical radiculopathy, multiple sclerosis, and other autoimmune-mediated causes of encephalomyelitis Carditis : Other infectious and noninfectious causes of conduction disturbances or myopericarditis Arthritis : Gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, septic arthritis, viral arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthritis, and sarcoid arthritis Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans : Aging skin, chilblains, venous insufficiency, superficial thrombophlebitis, eczema, morphea, scleroderma Borrelial lymphocytoma : Centrofollicular B cell lymphoma, follicular B cell lymphoma, Paget disease, inflammatory breast cancer, sarcoidosis, chronic infection, insect bite Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome : Long COVID, depression, hypothyroidism, fibromyalgia, myalgic-encephalomyelitis, micronutrient deficiencies (eg, vitamin B12) Prognosis Treatment is usually curative for early cases. However, treatment may be complicated due to late diagnosis, antibiotic treatment failure, and concurrent infection with other tick-borne diseases. For patients with early Lyme disease, more than 80% of patients have complete resolution of symptoms following recommended treatment. [7]   Approximately 10% to 20% of patients have lingering symptoms of fatigue, pain, or joint and muscle aches after treatment. These symptoms, known as posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome, can last for 6 or more months. Currently, a novel vaccine directed against the outer surface protein A target of Borrelia has been developed and is in a 3-year clinical trial (beginning in 2022). If successful, this vaccine may provide another means of prevention of Lyme disease and related complications in at-risk populations.  Complications The complications that can manifest with Lyme disease include: Arthritis Carditis Neurological deficits Ocular manifestations Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans Lymphocytoma Consultations Consultations that are typically requested for patients with this condition include the following: Infectious diseases Dermatology Neurology Rheumatology Cardiology Deterrence and Patient Education Lyme disease is a treatable and possibly preventable condition in the right circumstances. While many patients are unaware of a tick bite, those at risk of exposure are advised to implement personal protective measures to prevent the risk of exposure and infection by tick-borne pathogens. [17]  Chemical repellants containing N,N-Diethylmeta-toluamide (DEET), picaridin, ethyl-3-(N-n-butyl-Nacetyl) aminopropionate (IR3535), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), p-methane-3,8-diol (PMD), 2-undecanone, or permethrin are recommended. [17]   Additional prevention measures include wearing shoes, long-sleeved shirts, and pants when outside, showering after coming in from outside and checking the clothes and body for ticks after being outdoors. Children should be examined for ticks, particularly on the scalp, around the ears, and in the groin and buttock regions. Found ticks should be removed mechanically (eg, a clean, fine-tipped tweezer). Observing the tick for its shape, size, and any identifying features can be helpful in reporting to the healthcare clinician.  Patients who develop Lyme disease symptoms after a tick bite (eg, flu-like symptoms, fevers, rash or nerve, joint, and heart problems), should seek medical attention immediately. For patients who develop no symptoms after a tick bite, no antibiotic therapy is recommended unless it is from a high-risk tick, in which case prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be considered. [17]  Patients should be advised to monitor for the development of rash or systemic symptoms and return to a healthcare clinician to seek additional medical attention.  Pearls and Other Issues Based on the geographic distribution of the shared vector Ixodes\\nscapularis , coinfections with Lyme disease and human granulocytic anaplasmosis or babesiosis can occur. Co-infected patients may be more severely ill at presentation, have a persistent fever longer than 48 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease, or present with anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. When coinfection is suspected or confirmed, treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial regimen for each infection is necessary to resolve the illness. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The key to Lyme disease is prevention, recognition of complications, and prompt initiation of treatment once confirmed. Management spans the interprofessional continuum from the primary care setting to the specialist. Primary care clinicians, including family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics, can play a role in educating patients on preventing tick bites while hiking or working outdoors. These front-line clinicians may also help parents by showing them how to inspect their children for ticks at the end of an outdoor event in an endemic area and manage a tick bite if it occurs. Primary care, urgent care, and emergency medicine professionals play a critical role in recognizing the symptoms and signs of Lyme disease, ranging from appropriate identification of a bull's eye rash and prompt initiation of treatment to recognition and evaluation for later-stage findings of the disease. These individuals must know how to appropriately order and interpret serological tests for Lyme disease and when to refer patients who develop cardiac, neurological, musculoskeletal, or dermatologic manifestations. Primary care clinicians can also work with infectious diseases to determine the accuracy of diagnosis or in more complex cases where management decisions require further input. Other specialists can help interpret advanced testing such as cardiac imaging, electrocardiography findings, radiologic imaging, lab results, and additional advanced testing. Having a coordinated approach with the necessary specialist's expertise is critical to making a diagnosis and initiating prompt treatment. Effective communication between interprofessional healthcare team members, including nurses, advanced clinicians, physicians, and pharmacists, is essential to enhancing patient outcomes with Lyme disease.  Review Questions\\nAccess free multiple choice questions on this topic.\\nClick here for a simplified version.\\nComment on this article.\\nFigure Lyme Disease \\\"Bulls-Eye\\\" Rash.

Most commonly, the disease is transmitted by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in the northeastern and north-central United States. In Europe, the primary vector is Ixodes ricinus.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nThe presentation of Lyme disease symptoms typically occurs in stages:\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:** \\n   - The most distinctive sign is an expanding rash called erythema migrans (EM), which usually appears 3–30 days after a tick bite. \\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n   \\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:** \\n   - If left untreated, the infection may spread to other body parts. Symptoms may include additional rashes, facial paralysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n   \\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:** \\n   - Occurring months to years after infection, potential chronic manifestations include arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological issues—often termed Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n### Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is caused by spirochete bacteria, particularly Borrelia burgdorferi and others. Diagnosis typically involves:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Based on symptoms and history of tick exposure, particularly identifying EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Utilizes serologic tests to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy (ELISA followed by Western blot).\\n\\n### Treatment\\nAntibiotic treatment is essential for Lyme disease and varies according to the stage of the disease:\\n- **Oral antibiotics** (e.g., doxycycline, amoxicillin) are generally effective for early-stage Lyme disease.\\n- **Intravenous antibiotics** (e.g., ceftriaxone) may be necessary for severe neurological involvement or Lyme carditis.\\nTypical treatment durations are from 14 to 28 days, depending on the stage and severity of the disease.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nPrevention strategies are aimed at reducing tick bites:\\n- Use of insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wearing protective clothing when in tick-infested areas.\\n- Conducting tick checks after outdoor activities.\\n- Applying acaricides in residential areas can reduce tick populations.\\n\\n### Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in temperate areas. The disease has seen a significant rise in cases, largely due to environmental factors such as wildlife management and urbanization changes affecting tick populations.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nLyme disease is a significant public health concern with diverse and sometimes severe health implications. Understanding its transmission, symptoms, and effective management strategies is crucial for both prevention and treatment.\\n\\n#### References:\\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Continuing Education Activity Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious condition transmitted through the bite of infected ticks, primarily caused by the spirochete bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi in the United States and various Borrelia species in Europe and Asia. This disease progresses through three stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late disease. Initial symptoms often include a characteristic \\\"bull's-eye\\\" rash (erythema migrans), fever, and fatigue. If left untreated, the infection can advance to affect multiple systems, potentially leading to neurological symptoms, cardiac complications, and arthritis. The late stage may present with chronic arthritis and encephalopathy, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Through this continuing education course, healthcare professionals gain valuable insights into the recognition of Lyme disease's clinical features and the implementation of appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies. The course emphasizes the importance of a 2-step serologic testing process for accurate diagnosis and highlights the benefits of early antibiotic intervention to prevent disease progression. Participants learn how to effectively collaborate with an interprofessional team, including specialists in infectious diseases, neurology, and rheumatology, to enhance patient management and outcomes. This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive care, addressing various aspects of the disease and its complications, ultimately leading to improved patient recovery and quality of life.\\nObjectives:\\nIdentify the early clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, including erythema migrans, fever, and fatigue, to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment. Screen patients with a history of tick exposure or characteristic symptoms for Lyme disease using a 2-step serologic testing process to confirm the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi or related species. Select appropriate follow-up care strategies to monitor patient progress and response to treatment, ensuring effective management of Lyme disease and its sequelae. Collaborate with an interprofessional team, including specialists in infectious diseases, neurology, and rheumatology, to enhance the management of complex cases of Lyme disease.\\nAccess free multiple choice questions on this topic.\\nIntroduction Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is the most commonly transmitted tick-borne infection in the United States (US) and among the most frequently diagnosed tick-borne infections worldwide. Lyme disease is divided into 3 stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late. Early localized disease is distinguished by the red ring-like expanding rash of erythema migrans at the site of a recent tick bite. Other symptoms experienced at this stage may be malaise, headache, fever, myalgia, and arthralgia. Most patients only experience the symptoms of early localized disease. About 20% of patients develop early disseminated disease, with the most common symptoms being multiple erythema migrans lesions. Other symptoms of the disseminated stage are flu-like symptoms, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, myalgia, palsies of the cranial nerves, especially of cranial nerve VII, ophthalmic conditions, and lymphocytic meningitis. Additionally, cardiac manifestations, including conduction abnormalities, myocarditis, or pericarditis, may occur. The most common late-stage manifestation is arthritis, which is usually pauciarticular and affects large joints, especially the knees. [1] [2]  Lyme disease is a curable condition if identified and treated appropriately. Etiology In the US, Lyme disease is caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi ( and rarely Borrelia mayonii)  and is transmitted by the bite of an Ixodes genus black-legged tick. In Europe and Asia, the predominant causes of Lyme disease are  B  burgdorferi ,  Borrelia  afzelii , and  Borrelia  garinii . [3] [4]  In Asia, B garinii is the most common cause of Lyme disease.  B burgdorferi has a particular affinity for joints, while  B garinii  has a predilection for nervous system tissue.  B afzelii has an affinity for the skin. In the US,  Borrelia spp are transmitted by ticks, with Ixodes scapularis  being the main vector in the Northeastern and upper Midwest regions and  Ixodes pacificus  in the Western region.  Ixodes ricinus  and  Ixodes persulcatus  are the main species in Europe and Asia, respectively.  The tick lifecycle is significant to understanding when they are infectious. They have a 2- to 3-year life span and cycle through 4 life stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult. The larva and nymph must take a blood meal to advance to the next life stage, and the female ticks require blood to reproduce. During these meals, ticks become infected with the bacteria. Ticks attach to an animal host reservoir, typically birds or other small mammals such as mice and voles, and feed anywhere from 3 to 7 days. While ticks can feed on any mammal, deer are not a natural reservoir of the spirochete. Those infected nymphs and adult ticks spread the bacteria each time they subsequently feed.  Epidemiology Lyme disease is most commonly reported in the Northeastern and upper Midwestern US regions. The primary states with endemic Lyme disease are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Sporadic cases have been reported in northern California, Oregon, and Washington. [5] [6] The infection tends to occur during late spring, summer, and early fall, coinciding with activity of the nymph feeding and more interaction of people in spaces that increase the risk for a tick bite. In 2022, 62,551 cases of Lyme disease in the US were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). cdc.gov/lyme Other estimates place the actual number of cases much higher. More men than women tend to be affected. The age distribution is bimodal, with more children younger than 15 and adults 45 and older affected. Lyme disease can affect people of all ethnic backgrounds, but most cases reported are in White individuals. Pathophysiology The Borrelia spirochete lives in the midgut of the tick. Once the tick feeds, blood from the affected host triggers the proliferation of the spirochetes and induces the spirochete to express a protein called outer surface protein C, which allows the spirochete to invade the tick salivary glands by moving from the midgut closer to the tick mouthpiece. This process takes time and varies by species of tick and spirochete, but it explains why transmission to human hosts requires a tick to be attached to the host for more than 15 hours in most cases. During transmission, the spirochetes are deposited in the skin and then disseminated from the site of inoculation to other areas of the body.  The infected host's innate and adaptive immune system triggers macrophage- and antibody-mediated killing of the spirochetes. In some cases, the immune system can clear the infection without evidence of developing disease. However, due to sophisticated mechanisms by the spirochete to evade the host immune response, the infection may persist and develop clinically evident disease. [7]  The host inflammatory response is responsible for causing tissue damage in organs, including the heart, nervous tissue, and joints. The spirochete itself is not known to be directly toxic. The pathophysiology of posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) is unclear. Several theories have been suggested, though no evidence has been reported to support the existence of chronic B burgdorferi infection. Some active pathology may be present after the initial clearance of the microbes, the persistence of inappropriate immune activation and inflammation, or some combination of both. No one leading proposal has been established, and more research is needed in this area. [8]   For patients who develop postinfectious Lyme arthritis, a complex interplay is proposed between bacterial and host factors. No active infection can be identified in these cases, yet there is objective evidence of ongoing inflammation of the joints. The persistence of bacterial debris may continue to trigger immune activation. Additionally, immune system overactivation by protein-specific bacteria is possible. [9] Histopathology\\nErythema Migrans\\nA biopsy of erythema migrans is not needed to establish a diagnosis. Erythema migrans histologic findings are nonspecific, usually showing a perivascular cellular infiltrate consisting of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Rarely are mast cells and neutrophils identified. A biopsy may show eosinophilic infiltrates, representing a local reaction to the bite. Spirochetes may be identified using antibody-labeled or silver stains but are typically rarely identified in skin specimens and should not be used as a basis for diagnosis.\\nAcrodermatitis Chronica Atrophicans\\nHistopathology is essential for the diagnosis of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, which may overlap and be confused clinically with morphea, mycosis fungicides, or lichen sclerosis. [10]  Interstitial granulomatous infiltrates, which are CD68-positive, are common, and CD3-positive lymphocytes are predominant. Histiocytes are also part of the infiltrates in all cases. Plasma cells may be seen rarely but can be visualized by staining for CD138. Thickened collagen bundles and band-like infiltrates of CD4 T cells are other common features. Interstitial fibroblasts are also reduced and can be seen by staining for CD34. [10]\\nBorrelial Lymphocytoma\\nHistologic examination is performed in patients with suspected  Borrelia  lymphocytoma when the history is unclear enough to support a diagnosis, but the histopathology is generally nonspecific. Evaluating for other causes of nodules and ruling out neoplasm can help. The biopsy tends to show a dense dermal polyclonal lymphocytic infiltrate with lymphoid follicles and pseudoterminal centers or a pseudolymphoma. [11] History and Physical Lyme disease is classified into 3 stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late. Approximately 1.6% to 7% of individuals may have an asymptomatic Lyme infection. [7]  In most cases, however, patients develop symptoms of Lyme disease, with erythema migrans being the most common initial manifestation. Erythema migrans is characteristic of early localized disease, occurring 1 to 2 weeks after a tick bite. Patients may develop early disseminated or late disease if the infection persists or goes untreated. Early disseminated disease is associated with neurologic and cardiac manifestations. Neurologic Lyme disease manifestations include facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) palsy, lymphocytic meningitis, or radiculopathy. Cardiac involvement may consist of myopericarditis and heart block. Lyme arthritis is typically a late disease manifestation and may be monoarticular or pauciarticular, generally involving large joints, most commonly the knee, and occurring months after the initial tick bite. [12]  Because the symptoms are not specific, clinicians should consider other conditions and infections transmitted by ticks (eg, coinfection with Babesia microti and Ehrlichia ). Coinfection has been reported in approximately 10% of patients.\\nEarly Localized Disease\\nThe early localized phase of Lyme disease may present with an erythema migrans rash and low-grade fever. This stage usually occurs within 1 to 28 days following the tick bite. The erythema migrans rash is seen in 70% of patients and may develop between 7 to 14 days following the tick bite. The uniform rash usually occurs at the tick bite site and may burn, itch, or be asymptomatic. The rash tends to expand for a few days, and concentric rings may be visible (see Image.  Lyme Disease \\\"Bulls-Eye\\\" Rash). If left untreated, the rash persists for 2 to 3 weeks and may expand to 20 cm in diameter. About 20% of patients may have recurrent episodes of the rash, and multiple lesions are not uncommon. At the same time, flu-like symptoms may be present. A low-grade fever may be associated with myalgia, neck stiffness, and headache. Visual problems include eye redness and tearing.\\nEarly Disseminated Disease\\nStage 2 is the early disseminated phase of the disease process. This stage usually develops 3 to 12 weeks after the initial infection. Features may include general malaise, fever, neurological symptoms (dizziness and headache), muscle pain, or cardiac symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and dyspnea). About 20% of patients have centrl nervous system involvement, including meningitis, cranial neuropathies, radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar symptoms, or rarely encephalomyelitis. Bell palsy affecting the facial nerve is seen in approximately 5% of patients. The classic triad includes meningitis, cranial neuropathy, and motor or sensory radiculoneuropathy, but these features may occur alone.  Cardiac involvement may present with arrhythmias or transient heart block. Conduction abnormalities are not uncommon, but most cases are isolated and rarely last more than a few days. Seldom does a patient require permanent pacing. Sporadic cases of sudden cardiac death have occurred due to fulminant carditis. Ocular manifestations have also been described, with conjunctivitis being the most common feature and keratitis, iridocyclitis, retinal vasculitis, optic neuropathy, and uveitis being rare. Borrelial lymphocytoma is a rare presentation of early Lyme disease reported mainly in Europe; this condition tends to occur weeks to several months after the initial infection. Borrelial lymphocytoma presents as a slow-growing, painless plaque or nodule, which is red-bluish in coloration and usually occurs on the ear lobe in children or the breast in adults. [11]  The lesion may resolve spontaneously.\\nLate Disease\\nLate-stage Lyme disease may occur months after the initial infection. The typical features include neurological and musculoskeletal involvement. Many patients may not have a history of erythema migrans. However, these individuals may present with sensory axonal polyneuropathy, encephalomyelitis, or mononeuropathy. Cognitive deficits are common. Encephalopathy presents with deficits in concentration, cognition, memory loss, and personality changes. Extreme irritability and depression are also common. Encephalomyelitis is rare and can present with ataxia, seizures, hemiparesis, autonomic dysfunction, and hearing loss. Lyme arthritis tends to affect large joints, especially the knee. Symptoms manifest as joint pain with swelling and stiffness. Smaller joints, such as the elbow, may be involved, and episodes of bursitis or tendinitis may occur. Over time, in most cases, symptoms tend to subside even without intervention. In a small proportion of patients with Lyme arthritis, chronic inflammatory arthritis similar to rheumatoid arthritis may develop. This complication of Lyme disease is termed postinfectious Lyme arthritis.  Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is typically seen in older women and tends to occur on the dorsum of the hands and feet. This rash presents as bluish-red discoloration with some swelling that progresses very slowly as an expansive lesion, leading the skin to become atrophic over time; this may occur years following the primary infection, has been described chiefly in European cohorts, and may be confused with morphea. Evaluation A challenge in evaluating Lyme disease is that many patients diagnosed with the disease often have no recollection of a tick bite or a rash. Symptoms may be vague in most patients, and testing is needed in those cases where Lyme disease is suspected as an underlying etiology. Therefore, the CDC recommends a 2-step serologic testing process using US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared assays.  Serologic testing is unreliable during the first few weeks of infection, given the time needed for seroconversion. Patients presenting with erythema migrans rash and a history of residing in or traveling to an endemic region of Lyme disease may be treated based on clinical findings. In later stages of the disease, the 2-step approach is recommended for the serologic diagnosis of Lyme disease. The first step is to perform a quantitative screening test for serum antibodies to B burgdorferi using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunofluorescent antibody assay. If this step is negative, no further testing is recommended. A Western blot should follow specimens with positive or equivocal results. Standard 2-tier testing uses EIA as the first step and Western blot as the 2nd step. According to the CDC, an immunoblot is positive if at least 2 of 3 bands are present on the immunoglobulin (Ig) IgM immunoblot within 30 days of symptom onset or 5 to 10 bands are present on the IgG immunoblot at any time. [13] Serologic diagnosis is greater than 80% sensitive for patients with neurologic or cardiac manifestations. [14] [15] [16] Sequential serological testing is not recommended in the acute state because antibody titers often remain elevated for a long time. Testing the tick is also not recommended. False positive results may occur in patients with other conditions, including syphilis, rheumatoid arthritis, relapsing fever, and Epstein-Barr infection.\\nSuspected Cardiac Manifestations\\nSerologic testing is recommended for patients presenting with acute myocarditis or pericarditis of unknown cause in an appropriate epidemiologic setting. Specific cardiac testing with a screening electrocardiogram is recommended for patients presenting with dyspnea, edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, chest pain, and syncope and living in a Lyme endemic area. For those presenting with more severe potential manifestations, including exercise intolerance, palpitations, presyncope, syncope, pericardial pain, evidence of pericardial effusion, elevated biomarkers, edema, shortness of breath, or evidence of PR interval prolongation  of more than 300 milliseconds, admission to the hospital for continuous electrocardiogram monitoring is recommended.\\nSuspected Neurologic Manifestations\\nTesting is recommended for patients presenting with meningitis, painful radiculoneuritis, mononeuropathy multiplex including confluent mononeuropathy multiplex, acute cranial neuropathies, or in patients with evidence of spinal cord or brain inflammation, and with epidemiologically plausible exposure to ticks infected with B burgdorferi . [17]\\nSuspected Arthritic Manifestations\\nJoint aspiration is only recommended if a clinician suspects inflammatory arthritis. When assessing possible Lyme arthritis, serum antibody testing is recommended over polymerase chain reaction or culture of blood, synovial fluid, or tissue. However, a polymerase chain reaction of the synovial fluid or tissue can be performed if the diagnosis remains under question despite positive Lyme serologies.  Treatment / Management\\nLyme Disease Management\\nLyme disease treatment is divided into the following categories:\\nAsymptomatic patients with potential exposure:  Asymptomatic children and adults with a known tick bite should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics of a single dose of oral doxycycline 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children if the tick bite was from any of the following: An identified Ixodes spp vector species Occurred in a highly endemic area The tick was attached for ≥36 hours  [17]\\nErythema migrans rash:  Patients with 1 or more classic appearing erythema migrans rash in an endemic area for Lyme disease should be treated without further testing. Oral antibiotic therapy should be used with a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil. Second-line therapy is 5 to 10 days of azithromycin for those patients intolerant of or allergic to the former antibiotics. [17]  To establish a diagnosis before antibiotic treatment, serologic testing is recommended for patients with an atypical rash but suggestive of erythema migrans.\\nNeurologic manifestations:  Intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G, or oral doxycycline is recommended over other antimicrobials for 14 to 21 days. IV is preferred, but choosing oral or IV antibiotics should be based on patient-specific factors such as tolerance, access, or risk for adverse effects. [17]\\nCardiac manifestations:  For patients with symptomatic heart block, a temporary pacemaker may be placed over a permanent pacemaker, as in most cases with antibiotic treatment, heart block is reversible. Oral doxycycline as an outpatient is sufficient for patients with Lyme carditis and mild symptoms. For patients with Lyme carditis and more severe manifestations requiring hospitalization and monitoring, IV ceftriaxone is preferred with a switch to an oral antibiotic as the patient clinically improves. A total of 14 to 21 days of antibiotics is recommended. [17]\\nArthritis:  Lyme arthritis should be treated with oral doxycycline for 28 days. A second course of oral antibiotics may be administered to those with a partial response. For those who have had minimal or no response, IV ceftriaxone for 2 to 4 weeks can be administered. [17]  For patients who have developed postantibiotic Lyme arthritis refractory to a course of oral and a course of IV antibiotics, referral to a rheumatologist for consideration of intra-articular corticosteroid injections, use of disease-modifying agents or other advanced therapies should be considered.\\nBorrelial lymphocytoma:  Oral antibiotic therapy for 14 days is recommended. [17]\\nAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans:  Oral antibiotic therapy for 21 to 28 days is recommended. [17]\\nPosttreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome\\nTen to 20% of patients with Lyme disease will not respond to treatment and can develop PTLDS after using antibiotics. [18]  For patients with no objective manifestations of Lyme disease, such as active rash, cardiac or neurologic findings, or arthritis, but with persistent or recurring nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, pain, or cognitive impairment following recommended treatment for Lyme disease, there is no evidence that additional antibiotic therapy confers any benefit. Patients are treated for symptom management. For arthralgia and myalgia, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, heating pads, and physical therapy may be used. For neurocognitive symptoms, cessation of any medications that may contribute to neurocognitive symptoms should be considered. These medications may include benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, antihistamines, and opioids. [8]  Referrals to rheumatology, neurology, physical rehabilitation, and psychiatry specialists may be helpful.\\nAntibiotic Refractory Lyme Arthritis\\nAbout 10% of patients with Lyme arthritis will experience persistent inflammatory arthritis that does not respond to 1 or more round of antibiotic treatments. If no evidence of persistent infection is identified, this manifestation may be called postinfectious Lyme arthritis. A referral to a rheumatologist is indicated for further evaluation and management.\\nSpecial Populations\\nDoxycycline is used in most patients except in young children and those who are pregnant. In children, amoxicillin remains the drug of choice. For patients older than 8 with early, localized disease, doxycycline is recommended for 10 days. Patients younger than 8 should receive amoxicillin or cefuroxime for 14 days to avoid the potential for tooth staining caused by tetracycline use in young children. [19] [20] [21] Clinicians should monitor patients for the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction when starting therapy, which involves a transient worsening of symptoms during the first 24 hours of treatment. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is a cytokine-driven reaction to the antibiotic-mediated destruction of spirochetes. This reaction is seen in 5% to 15% of patients and usually resolves within 1 to 2 days. Treatment should not be interrupted if this reaction occurs, but symptom therapy with acetaminophen and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be helpful.  Differential Diagnosis In patients with erythema migrans, a careful history and physical examination are primarily what is required to diagnose Lyme disease. However, many patients with Lyme disease present without erythema migrans, and the diagnosis becomes a challenge. In those cases, erythema migrans may never have occurred, may not have been recognized, or may not have been correctly diagnosed by the clinician. The differential diagnoses for Lyme disease considered are guided by the clinical manifestation observed, including: Erythema migrans : Aarthropod hypersensitivity reaction, Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), cellulitis, erysipelas, erythema multiforme, tinea, nummular eczema, granuloma annular, contact dermatitis, urticaria, fixed drug eruption, pityriasis rosea, parvovirus B19 infection, dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus Neuroborreliosis : Other causes of facial palsy, viral meningitis, mechanical radiculopathy, multiple sclerosis, and other autoimmune-mediated causes of encephalomyelitis Carditis : Other infectious and noninfectious causes of conduction disturbances or myopericarditis Arthritis : Gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, septic arthritis, viral arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthritis, and sarcoid arthritis Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans : Aging skin, chilblains, venous insufficiency, superficial thrombophlebitis, eczema, morphea, scleroderma Borrelial lymphocytoma : Centrofollicular B cell lymphoma, follicular B cell lymphoma, Paget disease, inflammatory breast cancer, sarcoidosis, chronic infection, insect bite Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome : Long COVID, depression, hypothyroidism, fibromyalgia, myalgic-encephalomyelitis, micronutrient deficiencies (eg, vitamin B12) Prognosis Treatment is usually curative for early cases. However, treatment may be complicated due to late diagnosis, antibiotic treatment failure, and concurrent infection with other tick-borne diseases. For patients with early Lyme disease, more than 80% of patients have complete resolution of symptoms following recommended treatment. [7]   Approximately 10% to 20% of patients have lingering symptoms of fatigue, pain, or joint and muscle aches after treatment. These symptoms, known as posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome, can last for 6 or more months. Currently, a novel vaccine directed against the outer surface protein A target of Borrelia has been developed and is in a 3-year clinical trial (beginning in 2022). If successful, this vaccine may provide another means of prevention of Lyme disease and related complications in at-risk populations.  Complications The complications that can manifest with Lyme disease include: Arthritis Carditis Neurological deficits Ocular manifestations Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans Lymphocytoma Consultations Consultations that are typically requested for patients with this condition include the following: Infectious diseases Dermatology Neurology Rheumatology Cardiology Deterrence and Patient Education Lyme disease is a treatable and possibly preventable condition in the right circumstances. While many patients are unaware of a tick bite, those at risk of exposure are advised to implement personal protective measures to prevent the risk of exposure and infection by tick-borne pathogens. [17]  Chemical repellants containing N,N-Diethylmeta-toluamide (DEET), picaridin, ethyl-3-(N-n-butyl-Nacetyl) aminopropionate (IR3535), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), p-methane-3,8-diol (PMD), 2-undecanone, or permethrin are recommended. [17]   Additional prevention measures include wearing shoes, long-sleeved shirts, and pants when outside, showering after coming in from outside and checking the clothes and body for ticks after being outdoors. Children should be examined for ticks, particularly on the scalp, around the ears, and in the groin and buttock regions. Found ticks should be removed mechanically (eg, a clean, fine-tipped tweezer). Observing the tick for its shape, size, and any identifying features can be helpful in reporting to the healthcare clinician.  Patients who develop Lyme disease symptoms after a tick bite (eg, flu-like symptoms, fevers, rash or nerve, joint, and heart problems), should seek medical attention immediately. For patients who develop no symptoms after a tick bite, no antibiotic therapy is recommended unless it is from a high-risk tick, in which case prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be considered. [17]  Patients should be advised to monitor for the development of rash or systemic symptoms and return to a healthcare clinician to seek additional medical attention.  Pearls and Other Issues Based on the geographic distribution of the shared vector Ixodes\\nscapularis , coinfections with Lyme disease and human granulocytic anaplasmosis or babesiosis can occur. Co-infected patients may be more severely ill at presentation, have a persistent fever longer than 48 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease, or present with anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. When coinfection is suspected or confirmed, treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial regimen for each infection is necessary to resolve the illness. Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The key to Lyme disease is prevention, recognition of complications, and prompt initiation of treatment once confirmed. Management spans the interprofessional continuum from the primary care setting to the specialist. Primary care clinicians, including family medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics, can play a role in educating patients on preventing tick bites while hiking or working outdoors. These front-line clinicians may also help parents by showing them how to inspect their children for ticks at the end of an outdoor event in an endemic area and manage a tick bite if it occurs. Primary care, urgent care, and emergency medicine professionals play a critical role in recognizing the symptoms and signs of Lyme disease, ranging from appropriate identification of a bull's eye rash and prompt initiation of treatment to recognition and evaluation for later-stage findings of the disease. These individuals must know how to appropriately order and interpret serological tests for Lyme disease and when to refer patients who develop cardiac, neurological, musculoskeletal, or dermatologic manifestations. Primary care clinicians can also work with infectious diseases to determine the accuracy of diagnosis or in more complex cases where management decisions require further input. Other specialists can help interpret advanced testing such as cardiac imaging, electrocardiography findings, radiologic imaging, lab results, and additional advanced testing. Having a coordinated approach with the necessary specialist's expertise is critical to making a diagnosis and initiating prompt treatment. Effective communication between interprofessional healthcare team members, including nurses, advanced clinicians, physicians, and pharmacists, is essential to enhancing patient outcomes with Lyme disease.  Review Questions\\nAccess free multiple choice questions on this topic.\\nClick here for a simplified version.\\nComment on this article.\\nFigure Lyme Disease \\\"Bulls-Eye\\\" Rash.

In the United States, the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the primary vector, particularly in the northeastern and north-central regions. In Europe, Ixodes ricinus serves as the main vector. Lyme disease is the most commonly transmitted tick-borne illness in the U.S. and poses serious health risks if not properly diagnosed and treated.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can manifest in multiple stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:**\\n   - Characterized by the appearance of an expanding rash known as erythema migrans (EM), which typically develops within 3 to 30 days following a tick bite. The rash may resemble a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - If untreated, the infection may spread to other body areas. Symptoms in this stage can include additional rashes, facial paralysis (such as Bell's palsy), severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - This stage may occur months to years after the initial infection, leading to chronic manifestations such as arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological problems, often collectively referred to as Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is primarily caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and related species. The pathophysiology of Lyme disease involves the following:\\n- The spirochete enters the skin at the tick bite site and migrates locally, spreading through the lymphatics and bloodstream to various organs. \\n- The host's immune response leads to inflammation and tissue damage in the heart, nervous system, and joints.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis typically involves a combination of:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Identifying characteristic symptoms and confirming recent tick exposure, particularly the presence of EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Serological tests are employed to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy that consists of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a Western blot for confirmation.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment regimen for Lyme disease is contingent upon its stage:\\n- **Early Stage:** Oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective and are typically administered for 10 to 28 days, depending on the specific case.\\n- **Neurological or Cardiac Involvement:** Intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone may be required, depending on the severity of the symptoms.\\n- **Late Stage or Arthritis:** A longer course of antibiotics is often necessary for addressing Lyme arthritis or chronic symptoms.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention measures focus on minimizing exposure to ticks:\\n- Use insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wear protective clothing (long sleeves and pants) in tick-prone areas.\\n- Conduct body checks for ticks after outdoor activities.\\n- Apply acaricides in residential areas where ticks are prevalent.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is predominantly found in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in temperate regions. The incidence of the disease has significantly increased, correlating with rising tick populations due to environmental factors, wildlife management changes, and urbanization. In 2022, over 62,000 cases were officially reported in the U.S., representing a growing public health challenge.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease remains a significant public health concern with varying potential impacts on health. Understanding its transmission pathways, clinical presentation, and treatment options is vital for effective management and preventing severe long-term health complications related to the disease.\\n\\n## References\\n1.

Lyme disease is the most commonly transmitted tick-borne illness in the U.S. and poses serious health risks if not properly diagnosed and treated.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can manifest in multiple stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:**\\n   - Characterized by the appearance of an expanding rash known as erythema migrans (EM), which typically develops within 3 to 30 days following a tick bite. The rash may resemble a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - If untreated, the infection may spread to other body areas. Symptoms in this stage can include additional rashes, facial paralysis (such as Bell's palsy), severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - This stage may occur months to years after the initial infection, leading to chronic manifestations such as arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological problems, often collectively referred to as Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is primarily caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and related species. The pathophysiology of Lyme disease involves the following:\\n- The spirochete enters the skin at the tick bite site and migrates locally, spreading through the lymphatics and bloodstream to various organs. \\n- The host's immune response leads to inflammation and tissue damage in the heart, nervous system, and joints.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis typically involves a combination of:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Identifying characteristic symptoms and confirming recent tick exposure, particularly the presence of EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Serological tests are employed to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy that consists of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a Western blot for confirmation.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment regimen for Lyme disease is contingent upon its stage:\\n- **Early Stage:** Oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective and are typically administered for 10 to 28 days, depending on the specific case.\\n- **Neurological or Cardiac Involvement:** Intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone may be required, depending on the severity of the symptoms.\\n- **Late Stage or Arthritis:** A longer course of antibiotics is often necessary for addressing Lyme arthritis or chronic symptoms.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention measures focus on minimizing exposure to ticks:\\n- Use insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wear protective clothing (long sleeves and pants) in tick-prone areas.\\n- Conduct body checks for ticks after outdoor activities.\\n- Apply acaricides in residential areas where ticks are prevalent.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is predominantly found in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in temperate regions. The incidence of the disease has significantly increased, correlating with rising tick populations due to environmental factors, wildlife management changes, and urbanization. In 2022, over 62,000 cases were officially reported in the U.S., representing a growing public health challenge.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease remains a significant public health concern with varying potential impacts on health. Understanding its transmission pathways, clinical presentation, and treatment options is vital for effective management and preventing severe long-term health complications related to the disease.\\n\\n## References\\n1.

In the United States, the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the primary vector, particularly in the northeastern and north-central regions. In Europe, Ixodes ricinus serves as the main vector. Lyme disease is the most commonly transmitted tick-borne illness in the U.S. and poses serious health risks if not properly diagnosed and treated.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can manifest in multiple stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:**\\n   - Characterized by the appearance of an expanding rash known as erythema migrans (EM), which typically develops within 3 to 30 days following a tick bite. The rash may resemble a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Common early symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - If untreated, the infection may spread to other body areas. Symptoms in this stage can include additional rashes, facial paralysis (such as Bell's palsy), severe headaches, neck stiffness, and heart palpitations.\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - This stage may occur months to years after the initial infection, leading to chronic manifestations such as arthritis, cognitive impairments, and neurological problems, often collectively referred to as Lyme encephalopathy.\\n\\n## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is primarily caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and related species. The pathophysiology of Lyme disease involves the following:\\n- The spirochete enters the skin at the tick bite site and migrates locally, spreading through the lymphatics and bloodstream to various organs. \\n- The host's immune response leads to inflammation and tissue damage in the heart, nervous system, and joints.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis typically involves a combination of:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** Identifying characteristic symptoms and confirming recent tick exposure, particularly the presence of EM.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Serological tests are employed to detect antibodies against Borrelia. The CDC recommends a two-tiered testing strategy that consists of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a Western blot for confirmation.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment regimen for Lyme disease is contingent upon its stage:\\n- **Early Stage:** Oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective and are typically administered for 10 to 28 days, depending on the specific case.\\n- **Neurological or Cardiac Involvement:** Intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone may be required, depending on the severity of the symptoms.\\n- **Late Stage or Arthritis:** A longer course of antibiotics is often necessary for addressing Lyme arthritis or chronic symptoms.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPrevention measures focus on minimizing exposure to ticks:\\n- Use insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wear protective clothing (long sleeves and pants) in tick-prone areas.\\n- Conduct body checks for ticks after outdoor activities.\\n- Apply acaricides in residential areas where ticks are prevalent.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is predominantly found in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in temperate regions. The incidence of the disease has significantly increased, correlating with rising tick populations due to environmental factors, wildlife management changes, and urbanization. In 2022, over 62,000 cases were officially reported in the U.S., representing a growing public health challenge.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease remains a significant public health concern with varying potential impacts on health. Understanding its transmission pathways, clinical presentation, and treatment options is vital for effective management and preventing severe long-term health complications related to the disease.\\n\\n## References\\n1.

The rash often looks like a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Early symptoms may include:\\n     - Fever\\n     - Headache\\n     - Fatigue\\n     - Muscle and joint pain\\n     - Swollen lymph nodes\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - If the disease is not treated, it can spread to other parts of the body. This may lead to:\\n     - More rashes\\n     - Facial paralysis (like Bell's palsy)\\n     - Severe headaches\\n     - Neck stiffness\\n     - Heart palpitations\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - This stage can occur months or years after the initial infection, causing chronic issues such as:\\n     - Arthritis\\n     - Cognitive problems (like memory issues)\\n     - Neurological complications, often referred to as Lyme encephalopathy\\n\\n## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is mainly caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and similar species. The following describes how the bacteria works:\\n- The bacteria enter the body through the skin at the tick bite and can spread through the body's lymphatic system and bloodstream to various organs.\\n- The immune system's response to the infection leads to inflammation and potential damage to the heart, brain, and joints.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease typically involves:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** This involves looking at symptoms and confirming recent exposure to ticks, especially checking for the EM rash.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Blood tests are performed to look for antibodies against the Borrelia bacteria. The CDC suggests a two-step testing process: an initial Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) followed by a confirmation test known as Western blot.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment for Lyme disease depends on the stage of the disease:\\n- **Early Stage:** Oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline or amoxicillin, are commonly used and usually prescribed for 10 to 28 days.\\n- **Neurological or Cardiac Involvement:** More serious cases may require intravenous antibiotics, like ceftriaxone, depending on the symptoms.\\n- **Late Stage or Arthritis:** Chronic cases often require a more extended course of antibiotics to manage persistent symptoms.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventing Lyme disease revolves around minimizing risks of tick bites:\\n- Use insect repellents that contain DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wear protective clothing, like long sleeves and pants, when in areas where ticks are common.\\n- Perform body checks for ticks after activities performed outdoors.\\n- Consider using acaricides in residential areas to lower tick populations.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is mostly found in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly thriving in temperate regions. The number of cases has significantly increased, largely due to environmental changes, shifting wildlife patterns, and urbanization that contribute to rising tick populations. Over 62,000 cases were reported in the U.S. in 2022, indicating a growing public health issue.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is an important public health issue that can lead to various health problems. Understanding how it spreads, recognizing the symptoms, and knowing the treatment options is essential for effective management and prevention of severe and lasting complications caused by the disease.\\n\\n## References\\n1.

It occurs when the immune system overreacts to inhaled allergens present in the environment. Despite its name, hay fever is not caused by hay, nor does it typically involve a fever. Rather, it is a reaction to tiny particles known as allergens, which can include pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and insect particles.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can vary in severity and include:\\n- **Sneezing**\\n- **Nasal congestion and runny nose**\\n- **Itchy eyes, nose, or throat**\\n- **Red or watery eyes**\\n- **Headaches and sinus pressure**\\n- **Fatigue and tiredness**\\n- **Sore throat from postnasal drip**\\n- **Wheezing or coughing**\\n\\nThese symptoms can occur year-round or seasonally, depending on the individual's triggers. Seasonal symptoms are typically worse in specific seasons, aligning with higher pollen counts.\\n\\n## Causes and Triggers\\nAllergic rhinitis occurs due to the body's immune response to allergens. Some common triggers include:\\n- **Outdoor Allergens**: Pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds is prominent in spring and fall.\\n- **Indoor Allergens**: Dust mites, mold, pet dander, and cockroach droppings can cause symptoms year-round.\\n  \\nIndividuals may experience seasonal allergies known as \\\"hay fever\\\" or perennial allergies that last throughout the year.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis often involves a thorough examination by a healthcare provider who will consider the patient's history and symptoms. Allergy tests, including skin prick tests and specific IgE blood tests, may be administered to identify particular allergens that trigger the symptoms.\\n\\n## Treatment and Management\\nWhile hay fever cannot be completely prevented, various treatment options can alleviate symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Over-the-counter medications like loratadine (Claritin) and cetirizine (Zyrtec) help block histamine, reducing sneezing and itching.\\n- **Decongestants**: Medications such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) relieve nasal congestion.\\n- **Corticosteroid Nasal Sprays**: Products like Flonase and Nasacort reduce inflammation in the nasal passages.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Such as montelukast (Singulair), help prevent allergic reactions.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can desensitize the immune system to allergens over time.\\n\\nLifestyle modifications also play a critical role in managing symptoms, such as avoiding known allergens, utilizing air filters, and practicing good hygiene.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nWhile complete prevention of hay fever is impossible, individuals can reduce exposure to allergens by:\\n- Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n- Using air conditioning instead of opening windows.\\n- Regularly cleaning the home to reduce dust mites and mold.\\n- Washing bedding in hot water to eliminate dust mites.\\n- Wearing sunglasses and hats outdoors to protect against pollen.\\n\\n## Outlook\\nThe prognosis for individuals with hay fever is generally good. Most people can manage their symptoms effectively with appropriate treatments and lifestyle adjustments. However, those with asthma may find their symptoms exacerbated by hay fever, requiring additional management.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever, or allergic rhinitis, impacts a substantial percentage of the population, significantly affecting quality of life.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever?

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms.

Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever, and most people don’t get a fever.\\n\\n### Symptoms of Hay Fever  \\nSymptoms of hay fever can appear throughout the year. Common symptoms include:\\n- Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing, and a runny nose.\\n- Itchy nose, throat, and eyes.\\n- Red or watery eyes.\\n- Headaches, sinus pressure, and dark circles under the eyes.\\n- More mucus in your nose and throat.\\n- Tiredness.\\n- Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat (postnasal drip).\\n- Wheezing, coughing, and trouble breathing.\\n\\n### What Causes Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis)?  \\nAllergic rhinitis occurs when your immune system reacts to an irritant in the air. Allergens are harmless to most people, but if you have hay fever, your immune system mistakenly identifies them as threats.

It occurs when the immune system overreacts to inhaled allergens present in the environment. Despite its name, hay fever is not caused by hay, nor does it typically involve a fever. Rather, it is a reaction to tiny particles known as allergens, which can include pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and insect particles.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can vary in severity and include:\\n- Sneezing\\n- Nasal congestion and runny nose\\n- Itchy eyes, nose, or throat\\n- Red or watery eyes\\n- Headaches and sinus pressure\\n- Fatigue and tiredness\\n- Sore throat from postnasal drip\\n- Wheezing or coughing\\n\\nThese symptoms can occur year-round or seasonally, depending on the individual's triggers. Seasonal symptoms are typically worse in specific seasons, aligning with higher pollen counts.\\n\\n## Causes and Triggers\\nAllergic rhinitis occurs due to the body's immune response to allergens. Some common triggers include:\\n- **Outdoor Allergens**: Pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds is prominent in spring and fall.\\n- **Indoor Allergens**: Dust mites, mold, pet dander, and cockroach droppings can cause symptoms year-round.\\n  \\nIndividuals may experience seasonal allergies known as \\\"hay fever\\\" or perennial allergies that last throughout the year.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis often involves a thorough examination by a healthcare provider who will consider the patient's history and symptoms. Allergy tests, including skin prick tests and specific IgE blood tests, may be administered to identify particular allergens that trigger the symptoms.\\n\\n## Treatment and Management\\nWhile hay fever cannot be completely prevented, various treatment options can alleviate symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Over-the-counter medications like loratadine (Claritin) and cetirizine (Zyrtec) help block histamine, reducing sneezing and itching.\\n- **Decongestants**: Medications such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) relieve nasal congestion.\\n- **Corticosteroid Nasal Sprays**: Products like Flonase and Nasacort reduce inflammation in the nasal passages.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Such as montelukast (Singulair), help prevent allergic reactions.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can desensitize the immune system to allergens over time.\\n\\nLifestyle modifications also play a critical role in managing symptoms, such as avoiding known allergens, utilizing air filters, and practicing good hygiene.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nWhile complete prevention of hay fever is impossible, individuals can reduce exposure to allergens by:\\n- Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n- Using air conditioning instead of opening windows.\\n- Regularly cleaning the home to reduce dust mites and mold.\\n- Washing bedding in hot water to eliminate dust mites.\\n- Wearing sunglasses and hats outdoors to protect against pollen.\\n\\n## Outlook\\nThe prognosis for individuals with hay fever is generally good. Most people can manage their symptoms effectively with appropriate treatments and lifestyle adjustments. However, those with asthma may find their symptoms exacerbated by hay fever, requiring additional management.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever, or allergic rhinitis, impacts a substantial percentage of the population, significantly affecting quality of life. Awareness of triggers, effective diagnosis, and a culmination of treatment strategies can help individuals lead healthier, more comfortable lives despite the challenge of allergies.\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_11", "context": {"span_id": "0xfbf1cc1c08837d88", "trace_id": "0x1fc17f50d206d076e8961c4a66afa121"}, "parent_id": "0xa8c49be385ab7224", "start_time": 1742218701392280619, "end_time": 1742218734821349301, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"73af3a9edb914688a0ceb96ffde49d7e\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"Allergic rhinitis, also called hay fever, is an allergic reaction that causes sneezing, congestion, itchy nose, and watery eyes.

It occurs when the immune system overreacts to inhaled allergens present in the environment. Despite its name, hay fever is not caused by hay, nor does it typically involve a fever. Rather, it is a reaction to tiny particles known as allergens, which can include pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and insect particles.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can vary in severity and include:\\n- Sneezing\\n- Nasal congestion and runny nose\\n- Itchy eyes, nose, or throat\\n- Red or watery eyes\\n- Headaches and sinus pressure\\n- Fatigue and tiredness\\n- Sore throat from postnasal drip\\n- Wheezing or coughing\\n\\nThese symptoms can occur year-round or seasonally, depending on the individual's triggers. Seasonal symptoms are typically worse in specific seasons, aligning with higher pollen counts.\\n\\n## Causes and Triggers\\nAllergic rhinitis occurs due to the body's immune response to allergens. Some common triggers include:\\n- **Outdoor Allergens**: Pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds is prominent in spring and fall.\\n- **Indoor Allergens**: Dust mites, mold, pet dander, and cockroach droppings can cause symptoms year-round.\\n  \\nIndividuals may experience seasonal allergies known as \\\"hay fever\\\" or perennial allergies that last throughout the year.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis often involves a thorough examination by a healthcare provider who will consider the patient's history and symptoms. Allergy tests, including skin prick tests and specific IgE blood tests, may be administered to identify particular allergens that trigger the symptoms.\\n\\n## Treatment and Management\\nWhile hay fever cannot be completely prevented, various treatment options can alleviate symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Over-the-counter medications like loratadine (Claritin) and cetirizine (Zyrtec) help block histamine, reducing sneezing and itching.\\n- **Decongestants**: Medications such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) relieve nasal congestion.\\n- **Corticosteroid Nasal Sprays**: Products like Flonase and Nasacort reduce inflammation in the nasal passages.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Such as montelukast (Singulair), help prevent allergic reactions.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can desensitize the immune system to allergens over time.\\n\\nLifestyle modifications also play a critical role in managing symptoms, such as avoiding known allergens, utilizing air filters, and practicing good hygiene.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nWhile complete prevention of hay fever is impossible, individuals can reduce exposure to allergens by:\\n- Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n- Using air conditioning instead of opening windows.\\n- Regularly cleaning the home to reduce dust mites and mold.\\n- Washing bedding in hot water to eliminate dust mites.\\n- Wearing sunglasses and hats outdoors to protect against pollen.\\n\\n## Outlook\\nThe prognosis for individuals with hay fever is generally good. Most people can manage their symptoms effectively with appropriate treatments and lifestyle adjustments. However, those with asthma may find their symptoms exacerbated by hay fever, requiring additional management.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever, or allergic rhinitis, impacts a substantial percentage of the population, significantly affecting quality of life. Awareness of triggers, effective diagnosis, and a culmination of treatment strategies can help individuals lead healthier, more comfortable lives despite the challenge of allergies.\\n```\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_28", "context": {"span_id": "0xb9d6eff01c68225a", "trace_id": "0x1fc17f50d206d076e8961c4a66afa121"}, "parent_id": "0xfbf1cc1c08837d88", "start_time": 1742218701400340848, "end_time": 1742218702690193023, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"73af3a9edb914688a0ceb96ffde49d7e\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis) Senior Analyst\\n.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

Seasonal symptoms are typically worse in specific seasons, aligning with higher pollen counts.\\n\\n## Causes and Triggers\\nAllergic rhinitis occurs due to the body's immune response to allergens. Some common triggers include:\\n- **Outdoor Allergens**: Pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds is prominent in spring and fall.\\n- **Indoor Allergens**: Dust mites, mold, pet dander, and cockroach droppings can cause symptoms year-round.\\n  \\nIndividuals may experience seasonal allergies known as \\\"hay fever\\\" or perennial allergies that last throughout the year.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis often involves a thorough examination by a healthcare provider who will consider the patient's history and symptoms. Allergy tests, including skin prick tests and specific IgE blood tests, may be administered to identify particular allergens that trigger the symptoms.\\n\\n## Treatment and Management\\nWhile hay fever cannot be completely prevented, various treatment options can alleviate symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Over-the-counter medications like loratadine (Claritin) and cetirizine (Zyrtec) help block histamine, reducing sneezing and itching.\\n- **Decongestants**: Medications such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) relieve nasal congestion.\\n- **Corticosteroid Nasal Sprays**: Products like Flonase and Nasacort reduce inflammation in the nasal passages.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Such as montelukast (Singulair), help prevent allergic reactions.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can desensitize the immune system to allergens over time.\\n\\nLifestyle modifications also play a critical role in managing symptoms, such as avoiding known allergens, utilizing air filters, and practicing good hygiene.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nWhile complete prevention of hay fever is impossible, individuals can reduce exposure to allergens by:\\n- Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n- Using air conditioning instead of opening windows.\\n- Regularly cleaning the home to reduce dust mites and mold.\\n- Washing bedding in hot water to eliminate dust mites.\\n- Wearing sunglasses and hats outdoors to protect against pollen.\\n\\n## Outlook\\nThe prognosis for individuals with hay fever is generally good. Most people can manage their symptoms effectively with appropriate treatments and lifestyle adjustments. However, those with asthma may find their symptoms exacerbated by hay fever, requiring additional management.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever, or allergic rhinitis, impacts a substantial percentage of the population, significantly affecting quality of life.

It can be triggered by various allergens such as pollen, pet dander, mold, and insect particles. Symptoms may vary and can appear year-round or seasonally, typically worsening during specific seasons based on pollen counts. Diagnosis involves examination and possibly allergy testing. Treatment options include antihistamines, decongestants, corticosteroid nasal sprays, leukotriene inhibitors, and immunotherapy. While hay fever cannot be prevented, managing exposure to allergens and proper medication can significantly alleviate symptoms. \\n\\nFor a more detailed reading, please visit the source [Cleveland Clinic - Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever).\\n\\n----------\\n\\n# Detailed Report on Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever)\\n\\n## Overview\\nAllergic rhinitis, commonly known as hay fever, is an allergic reaction characterized by symptoms such as sneezing, congestion, an itchy nose, and watery eyes. It occurs when the immune system overreacts to inhaled allergens present in the environment. Despite its name, hay fever is not caused by hay, nor does it typically involve a fever. Rather, it is a reaction to tiny particles known as allergens, which can include pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and insect particles.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can vary in severity and include:\\n- Sneezing\\n- Nasal congestion and runny nose\\n- Itchy eyes, nose, or throat\\n- Red or watery eyes\\n- Headaches and sinus pressure\\n- Fatigue and tiredness\\n- Sore throat from postnasal drip\\n- Wheezing or coughing\\n\\nThese symptoms can occur year-round or seasonally, depending on the individual's triggers. Seasonal symptoms are typically worse in specific seasons, aligning with higher pollen counts.\\n\\n## Causes and Triggers\\nAllergic rhinitis occurs due to the body's immune response to allergens. Some common triggers include:\\n- **Outdoor Allergens**: Pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds is prominent in spring and fall.\\n- **Indoor Allergens**: Dust mites, mold, pet dander, and cockroach droppings can cause symptoms year-round.\\n  \\nIndividuals may experience seasonal allergies known as \\\"hay fever\\\" or perennial allergies that last throughout the year.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis often involves a thorough examination by a healthcare provider who will consider the patient's history and symptoms. Allergy tests, including skin prick tests and specific IgE blood tests, may be administered to identify particular allergens that trigger the symptoms.\\n\\n## Treatment and Management\\nWhile hay fever cannot be completely prevented, various treatment options can alleviate symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Over-the-counter medications like loratadine (Claritin) and cetirizine (Zyrtec) help block histamine, reducing sneezing and itching.\\n- **Decongestants**: Medications such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) relieve nasal congestion.\\n- **Corticosteroid Nasal Sprays**: Products like Flonase and Nasacort reduce inflammation in the nasal passages.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Such as montelukast (Singulair), help prevent allergic reactions.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can desensitize the immune system to allergens over time.\\n\\nLifestyle modifications also play a critical role in managing symptoms, such as avoiding known allergens, utilizing air filters, and practicing good hygiene.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nWhile complete prevention of hay fever is impossible, individuals can reduce exposure to allergens by:\\n- Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n- Using air conditioning instead of opening windows.\\n- Regularly cleaning the home to reduce dust mites and mold.\\n- Washing bedding in hot water to eliminate dust mites.\\n- Wearing sunglasses and hats outdoors to protect against pollen.\\n\\n## Outlook\\nThe prognosis for individuals with hay fever is generally good. Most people can manage their symptoms effectively with appropriate treatments and lifestyle adjustments. However, those with asthma may find their symptoms exacerbated by hay fever, requiring additional management.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever, or allergic rhinitis, impacts a substantial percentage of the population, significantly affecting quality of life. Awareness of triggers, effective diagnosis, and a culmination of treatment strategies can help individuals lead healthier, more comfortable lives despite the challenge of allergies.\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

The most commonly affected areas are the bladder (called cystitis) and the urethra (referred to as urethritis). The primary cause of these infections is the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli), typically found in the colon. Infections can lead to inflammation of the urinary tract lining, and if left untreated, may spread to the kidneys, causing severe complications like pyelonephritis.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of UTIs often include:\\n- A strong, persistent urge to urinate\\n- A burning sensation during urination\\n- Frequent urination in small amounts\\n- Pain or discomfort in the pelvic or lower abdominal area\\n- Changes in urine color (such as dark, cloudy, or reddish)\\n- Fever and chills, which indicate the infection may have reached the kidneys\\n\\nThese symptoms can vary based on whether the infection affects the lower or upper urinary tract.\\n\\n## Risk Factors and Anatomical Considerations\\n\\nUTIs are more common in females due to anatomical reasons; women have a shorter urethra, which allows bacteria to enter the bladder more easily. Other risk factors include:\\n- Sexual activity, which can introduce bacteria into the urethra\\n- Certain birth control methods, such as diaphragms\\n- Menopause, leading to hormonal changes that increase UTI risks\\n- A history of urinary tract infections\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\n\\nDiagnosing a UTI usually involves a urinalysis, which tests a urine sample for bacteria, blood, or pus. A urine culture may also be performed to identify the specific type of bacteria causing the infection, which helps in selecting effective antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n## Treatment\\n\\nThe standard treatment for UTIs consists of antibiotics effective against the identified bacteria. Common antibiotics used include:\\n- Nitrofurantoin\\n- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\\n- Fosfomycin\\n\\nThe treatment course typically lasts between 3 to 7 days, depending on the severity of the infection.\\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\n\\nTo reduce the likelihood of recurrent infections, preventive measures are crucial. Key recommendations include:\\n- Drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated and help flush out bacteria from the urinary tract\\n- Urinating after sexual intercourse to remove potential bacteria\\n- Practicing good personal hygiene, such as wiping from front to back after using the restroom\\n- Avoiding bladder irritants like caffeine, alcohol, and citrus juices\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nIf not treated, UTIs can lead to serious complications, such as recurrent infections and permanent kidney damage. In elderly individuals, UTIs may present differently, often showing as confusion or changes in mental status rather than typical urinary symptoms.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUrinary Tract Infections are a common yet serious health issue, especially affecting women due to anatomical factors. Understanding the causes, symptoms, and risk factors associated with UTIs is essential for early diagnosis and effective treatment. Implementing preventive measures can help reduce the occurrence and impact of these infections on health.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine. The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper stomach area. They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine. Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate.

Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra.\\nA urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system. The urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra.\\nWomen are at greater risk of developing a UTI than are men. If an infection is limited to the bladder, it can be painful and annoying. But serious health problems can result if a UTI spreads to the kidneys.\\nHealth care providers often treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex.

We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end.

Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.\\nThe most common UTI s occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.\\nInfection of the bladder. This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.\\nHaving sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.\\nInfection of the urethra. This type of UTI can happen when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.\\nRisk factors UTI s are common in women. Many women experience more than one UTI during their lifetimes.\\nRisk factors for UTI s that are specific to women include:\\nFemale anatomy. Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.\\nSexual activity. Being sexually active tends to lead to more UTI s. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.\\nCertain types of birth control. Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk of UTI s. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.\\nMenopause. After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nOther risk factors for UTI s include:\\nUrinary tract problems. Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can cause UTI s.\\nBlockages in the urinary tract. Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk of UTI s is higher.\\nA suppressed immune system. Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk of UTI s.\\nCatheter use. People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk of UTI s. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.\\nA recent urinary procedure. Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing a UTI .\\nComplications When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated, UTI s can cause serious health problems.\\nComplications of a UTI may include:\\nRepeated infections, which means you have two or more UTI s within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.\\nPermanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreated UTI .\\nDelivering a low birth weight or premature infant when a UTI occurs during pregnancy.\\nA narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.\\nSepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.\\nPrevention These steps may help lower the risk of UTI s:\\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.\\nTry cranberry juice. Studies that look into whether cranberry juice prevents UTI s aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.\\nWipe from front to back. Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.\\nEmpty your bladder soon after having sex. Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.\\nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.\\nChange your birth control method. Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) care at Mayo Clinic\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nSept. 14, 2022\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nPartin AW, et al., eds.

This type of infection can involve your: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Urethra ( urethritis ). Kidneys ( pyelonephritis ). Bladder ( cystitis ). Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs. What is the urinary tract? The urinary tract makes and stores pee. It includes your: Kidneys . Kidneys are small, bean-shaped organs on the back of your body, above your hips. Most people have two kidneys. They filter water and waste products from your blood, which becomes pee. Common wastes include urea and creatinine. Ureters. Your ureters are thin tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder. Bladder. Your bladder is a balloon-like organ that stores pee before it leaves your body. Urethra . The urethra is a tube that carries pee from your bladder to the outside of your body. How common are urinary tract infections? UTIs are very common, especially in females . About half of females will have a UTI at some point during their lives. Males can also get UTIs, as well as children, though they only affect 1% to 2% of children. Healthcare providers treat 8 million to 10 million people each year for UTIs. Advertisement Symptoms and Causes A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. What are the signs of a urinary tract infection? A UTI causes inflammation in the lining of your urinary tract. The inflammation may cause the following problems: Pain in your flank , abdomen, pelvic area or lower back . Pressure in the lower part of your pelvis. Cloudy, foul-smelling pee. Urinary incontinence . Frequent urination . Urge incontinence . Pain when you pee ( dysuria ). Blood in your pee ( hematuria ). Other UTI-associated symptoms may include: Pain in your penis. Feeling extremely tired ( fatigue ). Fever . Chills . Nausea and vomiting . Mental changes or confusion. How do you get a urinary tract infection? Microorganisms — usually bacteria — cause urinary tract infections. They typically enter through your urethra and may infect your bladder. The infection can also travel up from your bladder through your ureters and eventually infect your kidneys. What is the major cause of a urinary tract infection? E. coli cause more than 90% of bladder infections. E. coli typically exist in your lower intestines ( large intestine ). Who is at the greatest risk of getting a urinary tract infection? Anyone can get a urinary tract infection, but you’re more likely to get a UTI if you don't have a penis. This is because your urethra is shorter and closer to your anus , where E. coli bacteria are common. Can you get a UTI from fingers? Yes, it’s possible to get a UTI from your fingers. Your hands can pick up bacteria and other microorganisms whenever you touch a surface. You can accidentally introduce bacteria to your urethra when you go to the bathroom or during sexual acts, including masturbation or fingering. It’s a good idea to wash your hands before and after going to the bathroom or having sex. Diagnosis and Tests How do you know if you have a UTI? If you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection, talk to a healthcare provider. They’ll ask questions about your symptoms, review your medical history and conduct a physical examination . They can also order tests to help confirm a diagnosis. What tests will be done to diagnose a urinary tract infection? A healthcare provider may order the following tests to diagnose a UTI: Urinalysis . During this test, you’ll pee into a special cup. The provider will send the sample to a laboratory, where technicians will examine it for signs of a UTI using multiple variables such as nitrites , leukocyte esterase and white blood cells . Urine culture . You’ll pee into a special cup, and lab technicians will test your sample to grow and identify any bacteria that are present. Urine cultures are important because they help your provider determine the most appropriate treatment. If your infection doesn’t respond to treatment, a provider may order the following tests to examine your urinary tract for a disease or injury: Ultrasound . An ultrasound is an imaging test that helps your provider look at your internal organs. An ultrasound is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. Computed tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is another imaging test. It’s a type of X-ray that takes cross-section images of your body — like slices — that create 3D images of the inside of your body. A CT scan is more precise than a standard X-ray. Cystoscopy . A cystoscopy uses a cystoscope to look inside your bladder through your urethra. A cystoscope is a thin instrument with a lens and a light at the end. Advertisement If you get UTIs frequently, a healthcare provider may perform tests to check for other health issues — such as diabetes or an abnormal urinary system — that may contribute to your infections. Management and Treatment What is the best thing to do for a urinary tract infection? The best thing to do for a urinary tract infection is to see a healthcare provider. You need antibiotics to treat a UTI. Your provider will select an antibiotic that works best against the bacteria responsible for your infection. Once you get a prescription for antibiotics, it’s very important that you follow the directions for taking them. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away and you start feeling better. If you don’t finish all your medicine, the infection can return and be more challenging to treat. If you get UTIs a lot, a provider may recommend that you take antibiotics: Every day. Every other day. After sex. At the first sign of symptoms. Talk to a provider about your best treatment option if you have a history of frequent UTIs. What specific antibiotics are used to treat a urinary tract infection? Healthcare providers commonly prescribe the following antibiotics to treat UTIs: Nitrofurantoin . Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim . Amoxicillin . Cephalosporins, such as cephalexin . Doxycycline . Fosfomycin. Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin . Advertisement If you get UTIs often, a healthcare provider may give you low-dose antibiotics for a short time to prevent the infection from coming back. The provider may recommend this cautious approach to treat frequent UTIs because your body can develop resistance to the antibiotic, and you can get other types of infections, including C. diff colitis . This practice isn’t very common. Can I become immune to the antibiotics used to treat a UTI? Sort of. Every time you use antibiotics to treat a UTI, the infection adapts and can become harder to fight ( antibiotic resistance ). But the infection becomes immune to the antibiotics, not you. Antibiotics may not always be the best solution. As a result, a healthcare provider may suggest alternative treatments if you get frequent urinary tract infections. These may include: Waiting . Your provider may suggest a “watch and wait” approach to your symptoms. During this time, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids (especially water) to help flush out your system. Intravenous (IV) treatment . In some complicated cases, a UTI may be resistant to antibiotics, or the infection may move to your kidneys. You may need treatment at a hospital, where providers will give you medicine through a needle they insert into a vein, usually in your arm (intravenously). Once you return home, you may need to take oral antibiotics for a period to rid yourself of the infection completely. Advertisement Does cranberry juice prevent a urinary tract infection? Cranberry juice that you can buy at the grocery store doesn’t prevent a UTI. However, cranberry extract supplements (vitamin pills) may decrease your chances of getting a UTI. If you get UTIs often, methenamine hippurate is another nonantibiotic alternative that helps prevent infections. Can a UTI go away on its own? Minor urinary tract infections can sometimes get better on their own. However, most UTIs need antibiotics to go away. You absolutely need antibiotics if you have a UTI as well as: A fever. Chills. Nausea and vomiting. How soon after treatment will I feel better? Most people feel better within a few days after starting antibiotics to treat a UTI. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent a urinary tract infection? The following lifestyle changes can help prevent urinary tract infections: Practice good hygiene Practicing good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent UTIs. This is especially important if you have a vagina because your urethra is much shorter, and it’s easier for E. coli to move from your rectum back into your body. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement (pooping) to avoid this. During your menstrual cycle , it’s also a good idea to regularly change your period products, including pads and tampons. You should also avoid using any deodorants on your vagina. Drink plenty of fluids Drinking extra fluids — especially water — each day can help flush out bacteria from your urinary tract. Healthcare providers recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water daily. Change your peeing habits Peeing can play a big role in getting rid of bacteria from your body. Your pee is a waste product, and each time you empty your bladder, you help remove that waste from your body. Peeing frequently can reduce your risk of developing an infection, especially if you get UTIs a lot. You should also try to pee right before and right after having sex. Sex can introduce bacteria to your urethra, and peeing before and after sex helps flush it out. If you can’t pee, wash the area with warm water. Change your birth control You may have an increased risk of developing a UTI if you use a diaphragm for birth control. Talk to a healthcare provider about other birth control options . Use a water-based lubricant during sex If you use lubricant during sex, make sure it’s water-based. You should also avoid spermicide if you have frequent UTIs. Change your clothing Tight-fitting clothing can create a moist environment, which promotes bacterial growth. You can try loose-fitting clothing and cotton underwear to prevent moisture from accumulating around your urethra. Medications If you’re postmenopausal , a healthcare provider may suggest a vaginal cream that contains estrogen . These creams may help reduce your risk of developing a UTI by changing the pH of your vagina. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re postmenopausal and get a lot of UTIs. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements — including cranberry extract and probiotics — may also help prevent UTIs. Talk to a healthcare provider before you start taking any supplements. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a urinary tract infection? The outlook for urinary tract infections is good. Most UTIs usually respond very well to treatment. A UTI can be annoying or uncomfortable before you start treatment. However, once a healthcare provider identifies the bacteria and prescribes the appropriate antibiotic, your symptoms should improve quickly. It’s important to finish all of the antibiotics that your healthcare provider prescribes. If you have frequent UTIs or your symptoms aren’t improving, your provider may test to see if your infection is resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections may require IV antibiotics or other treatments. Living With When should I go to the doctor for a UTI? Call a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a UTI. Call them again if they diagnosed you with a UTI and your symptoms worsen. You may need a different treatment. When should I go to ER? Go to the emergency room if you have a UTI and develop the following symptoms: Fever. Back pain. Vomiting. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? How do you know that I have a urinary tract infection? If I don’t have a urinary tract infection, what other condition do I have? What bacteria are responsible for my urinary tract infection? What antibiotic will you prescribe to treat my urinary tract infection? Are there any special directions I need to follow while taking antibiotics? How long will it take to feel better? Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? What can I do to help relieve my symptoms at home? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between a urinary tract infection and cystitis? A UTI is an infection in your urinary system, which may include your kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra. Cystitis is a type of UTI. It’s an infection in your bladder, and it’s the most common type of UTI. How can you tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a bladder infection? A urinary tract infection is a more general type of infection. There are many parts of your urinary tract. A UTI is a term for an infection that takes place throughout your urinary tract. A bladder infection is a specific infection that makes its way to your bladder and causes inflammation. Another name for a bladder infection is cystitis. Not all UTIs become bladder infections. It’s important to treat a UTI quickly to prevent the infection from spreading to other areas of your urinary tract. The infection can spread not only to your bladder but also to your kidneys. Kidney infections are a more complicated type of infection. Another name for a kidney infection is pyelonephritis. A note from Cleveland Clinic Urinary tract infections are when you have an infection in your urinary system. You may feel embarrassed if you have symptoms that affect your genitals or cause incontinence, but it’s OK — you haven’t done anything wrong. A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, and your symptoms should go away in a few days. Follow your provider’s instructions and take your full course of antibiotics to ensure the UTI goes away.

The most commonly affected area in UTIs is the bladder (cystitis) and the urethra (urethritis). The majority of these infections are caused by the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli), which typically live in the colon. Infections can lead to inflammation of the urinary tract lining and, in severe cases, may spread to the kidneys, causing further complications such as pyelonephritis.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nThe symptoms of UTIs often include:\\n- A strong, persistent urge to urinate\\n- A burning sensation when urinating\\n- Frequent urination, often in small amounts\\n- Pelvic or lower abdominal pain\\n- Changes in urine color (dark, cloudy, or reddish)\\n- Fever and chills, indicating that the infection may have reached the kidneys\\n\\nThese symptoms may vary depending on whether the infection is in the lower or upper urinary tract.\\n\\n## Risk Factors and Anatomical Considerations\\n\\nUTIs are particularly more common in females due to their anatomical structure; women have a shorter urethra, which allows bacteria to reach the bladder more easily. Other risk factors include:\\n- Sexual activity, which can introduce bacteria into the urethra\\n- Certain forms of birth control, such as diaphragms\\n- Menopause, which leads to hormonal changes that may increase the risk of UTIs\\n- A history of urinary tract infections\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\n\\nDiagnosing a UTI typically involves a urinalysis, where a sample of urine is tested for the presence of bacteria, blood, or pus. A urine culture may also be conducted to determine the specific type of bacteria causing the infection and to tailor appropriate antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n## Treatment\\n\\nThe standard treatment for UTIs includes antibiotics that are effective against the bacteria identified. Common antibiotics include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin. The course of treatment can range from 3 to 7 days, depending on the severity of the infection. \\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\n\\nPreventive measures are essential in reducing the likelihood of recurrent infections. Key recommendations include:\\n- Drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated and flush out bacteria from the urinary tract\\n- Urinating after sexual intercourse to eliminate potential bacteria\\n- Practicing good personal hygiene, including wiping from front to back after using the restroom\\n- Avoiding irritants such as caffeine, alcohol, and citrus juices, which can irritate the bladder\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nIf left untreated, UTIs can lead to severe complications, including recurrent infections and permanent kidney damage. In elderly patients, infections can present differently, often manifesting as confusion or changes in mental status rather than typical urinary symptoms.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUrinary Tract Infections are a common yet serious health concern, predominantly affecting women due to anatomical factors. Understanding the causes, symptoms, and risk factors associated with UTIs is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. Implementing preventive measures can significantly reduce the occurrence and impact of these infections on health. Continued research and awareness are essential in managing and treating UTIs effectively. \\n\\nBy staying informed and proactive, individuals can better navigate the challenges posed by urinary tract infections.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_14", "context": {"span_id": "0xa9587eb7614451e5", "trace_id": "0x1fc17f50d206d076e8961c4a66afa121"}, "parent_id": "0x8d9dd578f599654c", "start_time": 1742218769257281352, "end_time": 1742218785700613830, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"73af3a9edb914688a0ceb96ffde49d7e\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"1. **Mayo Clinic** - Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Overview:\\n   - UTIs are infections in any part of the urinary system, mainly affecting the bladder and urethra.

The most commonly affected area in UTIs is the bladder (cystitis) and the urethra (urethritis). The majority of these infections are caused by the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli), which typically live in the colon. Infections can lead to inflammation of the urinary tract lining and, in severe cases, may spread to the kidneys, causing further complications such as pyelonephritis.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nThe symptoms of UTIs often include:\\n- A strong, persistent urge to urinate\\n- A burning sensation when urinating\\n- Frequent urination, often in small amounts\\n- Pelvic or lower abdominal pain\\n- Changes in urine color (dark, cloudy, or reddish)\\n- Fever and chills, indicating that the infection may have reached the kidneys\\n\\nThese symptoms may vary depending on whether the infection is in the lower or upper urinary tract.\\n\\n## Risk Factors and Anatomical Considerations\\n\\nUTIs are particularly more common in females due to their anatomical structure; women have a shorter urethra, which allows bacteria to reach the bladder more easily. Other risk factors include:\\n- Sexual activity, which can introduce bacteria into the urethra\\n- Certain forms of birth control, such as diaphragms\\n- Menopause, which leads to hormonal changes that may increase the risk of UTIs\\n- A history of urinary tract infections\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\n\\nDiagnosing a UTI typically involves a urinalysis, where a sample of urine is tested for the presence of bacteria, blood, or pus. A urine culture may also be conducted to determine the specific type of bacteria causing the infection and to tailor appropriate antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n## Treatment\\n\\nThe standard treatment for UTIs includes antibiotics that are effective against the bacteria identified. Common antibiotics include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin. The course of treatment can range from 3 to 7 days, depending on the severity of the infection. \\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\n\\nPreventive measures are essential in reducing the likelihood of recurrent infections. Key recommendations include:\\n- Drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated and flush out bacteria from the urinary tract\\n- Urinating after sexual intercourse to eliminate potential bacteria\\n- Practicing good personal hygiene, including wiping from front to back after using the restroom\\n- Avoiding irritants such as caffeine, alcohol, and citrus juices, which can irritate the bladder\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nIf left untreated, UTIs can lead to severe complications, including recurrent infections and permanent kidney damage. In elderly patients, infections can present differently, often manifesting as confusion or changes in mental status rather than typical urinary symptoms.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUrinary Tract Infections are a common yet serious health concern, predominantly affecting women due to anatomical factors.

The most commonly affected area in UTIs is the bladder (cystitis) and the urethra (urethritis). The majority of these infections are caused by the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli), which typically live in the colon. Infections can lead to inflammation of the urinary tract lining and, in severe cases, may spread to the kidneys, causing further complications such as pyelonephritis.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nThe symptoms of UTIs often include:\\n- A strong, persistent urge to urinate\\n- A burning sensation when urinating\\n- Frequent urination, often in small amounts\\n- Pelvic or lower abdominal pain\\n- Changes in urine color (dark, cloudy, or reddish)\\n- Fever and chills, indicating that the infection may have reached the kidneys\\n\\nThese symptoms may vary depending on whether the infection is in the lower or upper urinary tract.\\n\\n## Risk Factors and Anatomical Considerations\\n\\nUTIs are particularly more common in females due to their anatomical structure; women have a shorter urethra, which allows bacteria to reach the bladder more easily. Other risk factors include:\\n- Sexual activity, which can introduce bacteria into the urethra\\n- Certain forms of birth control, such as diaphragms\\n- Menopause, which leads to hormonal changes that may increase the risk of UTIs\\n- A history of urinary tract infections\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\n\\nDiagnosing a UTI typically involves a urinalysis, where a sample of urine is tested for the presence of bacteria, blood, or pus. A urine culture may also be conducted to determine the specific type of bacteria causing the infection and to tailor appropriate antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n## Treatment\\n\\nThe standard treatment for UTIs includes antibiotics that are effective against the bacteria identified. Common antibiotics include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin. The course of treatment can range from 3 to 7 days, depending on the severity of the infection. \\n\\n## Prevention Strategies\\n\\nPreventive measures are essential in reducing the likelihood of recurrent infections. Key recommendations include:\\n- Drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated and flush out bacteria from the urinary tract\\n- Urinating after sexual intercourse to eliminate potential bacteria\\n- Practicing good personal hygiene, including wiping from front to back after using the restroom\\n- Avoiding irritants such as caffeine, alcohol, and citrus juices, which can irritate the bladder\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nIf left untreated, UTIs can lead to severe complications, including recurrent infections and permanent kidney damage. In elderly patients, infections can present differently, often manifesting as confusion or changes in mental status rather than typical urinary symptoms.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUrinary Tract Infections are a common yet serious health concern, predominantly affecting women due to anatomical factors. Understanding the causes, symptoms, and risk factors associated with UTIs is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. Implementing preventive measures can significantly reduce the occurrence and impact of these infections on health. Continued research and awareness are essential in managing and treating UTIs effectively. \\n\\nBy staying informed and proactive, individuals can better navigate the challenges posed by urinary tract infections.\\n\\nBegin!

There is no specific cure for the cold; treatments focus on alleviating symptoms, which may include:\\n- **Over-the-Counter Medications**: Pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for alleviating pain, decongestants to relieve nasal congestion, and antihistamines to reduce runny noses.\\n- **Hydration and Rest**: Drinking plenty of fluids and getting enough sleep are crucial for recovery.\\n\\nAntibiotics do not work on viruses and should not be given for colds.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo reduce the chances of getting or spreading a cold, it's helpful to:\\n- **Wash Hands Often**: Especially after using the restroom or before eating—wash for at least 20 seconds.\\n- **Avoid Close Contact with Sick People**: Keeping distance can lower exposure risks.\\n- **Disinfect Frequently Touched Surfaces**: Cleaning common areas often can help decrease the presence of viruses.\\n- **Use Hand Sanitizers**: When soap and water are unavailable, sanitizers are a good alternative.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nAlthough the common cold is usually not serious, it can lead to significant health issues in some populations. Most colds heal on their own within a week. If symptoms worsen or last longer than 10 days, it is wise to consult a healthcare professional to ensure there are no other underlying problems.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Common Cold Senior Summarizer\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}], \"token_usage\": {\"total_tokens\": 45658, \"prompt_tokens\": 43019, \"cached_prompt_tokens\": 26624, \"completion_tokens\": 2639, \"successful_requests\": 9}}, {\"raw\": \"# Influenza (Flu) Comprehensive Report\\n\\n## Overview\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect the nose, throat, and lungs.

The ticks that mainly carry this disease in the United States are known as black-legged ticks (scientific name: Ixodes scapularis). This disease is particularly common in the northeastern and north-central parts of the U.S. In Europe, another tick called Ixodes ricinus is responsible for spreading it. Lyme disease is the most frequently reported tick-borne illness in the country and can lead to serious health issues if it goes undiagnosed and untreated.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nSymptoms of Lyme disease can show up in different stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:**\\n   - The most noticeable sign is a spreading rash called erythema migrans (EM), which typically appears between 3 to 30 days after being bitten by an infected tick. The rash often looks like a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Early symptoms may include:\\n     - Fever\\n     - Headache\\n     - Fatigue\\n     - Muscle and joint pain\\n     - Swollen lymph nodes\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - If the disease is not treated, it can spread to other parts of the body. This may lead to:\\n     - More rashes\\n     - Facial paralysis (like Bell's palsy)\\n     - Severe headaches\\n     - Neck stiffness\\n     - Heart palpitations\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - This stage can occur months or years after the initial infection, causing chronic issues such as:\\n     - Arthritis\\n     - Cognitive problems (like memory issues)\\n     - Neurological complications, often referred to as Lyme encephalopathy\\n\\n## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is mainly caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and similar species. The following describes how the bacteria works:\\n- The bacteria enter the body through the skin at the tick bite and can spread through the body's lymphatic system and bloodstream to various organs.\\n- The immune system's response to the infection leads to inflammation and potential damage to the heart, brain, and joints.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease typically involves:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** This involves looking at symptoms and confirming recent exposure to ticks, especially checking for the EM rash.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Blood tests are performed to look for antibodies against the Borrelia bacteria. The CDC suggests a two-step testing process: an initial Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) followed by a confirmation test known as Western blot.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment for Lyme disease depends on the stage of the disease:\\n- **Early Stage:** Oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline or amoxicillin, are commonly used and usually prescribed for 10 to 28 days.\\n- **Neurological or Cardiac Involvement:** More serious cases may require intravenous antibiotics, like ceftriaxone, depending on the symptoms.\\n- **Late Stage or Arthritis:** Chronic cases often require a more extended course of antibiotics to manage persistent symptoms.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventing Lyme disease revolves around minimizing risks of tick bites:\\n- Use insect repellents that contain DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wear protective clothing, like long sleeves and pants, when in areas where ticks are common.\\n- Perform body checks for ticks after activities performed outdoors.\\n- Consider using acaricides in residential areas to lower tick populations.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is mostly found in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly thriving in temperate regions. The number of cases has significantly increased, largely due to environmental changes, shifting wildlife patterns, and urbanization that contribute to rising tick populations. Over 62,000 cases were reported in the U.S. in 2022, indicating a growing public health issue.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is an important public health issue that can lead to various health problems. Understanding how it spreads, recognizing the symptoms, and knowing the treatment options is essential for effective management and prevention of severe and lasting complications caused by the disease.\\n\\n## References\\n1.

The ticks that mainly carry this disease in the United States are known as black-legged ticks (scientific name: Ixodes scapularis). This disease is particularly common in the northeastern and north-central parts of the U.S. In Europe, another tick called Ixodes ricinus is responsible for spreading it. Lyme disease is the most frequently reported tick-borne illness in the country and can lead to serious health issues if it goes undiagnosed and untreated.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nSymptoms of Lyme disease can show up in different stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Infection:**\\n   - The most noticeable sign is a spreading rash called erythema migrans (EM), which typically appears between 3 to 30 days after being bitten by an infected tick. The rash often looks like a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Early symptoms may include:\\n     - Fever\\n     - Headache\\n     - Fatigue\\n     - Muscle and joint pain\\n     - Swollen lymph nodes\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - If the disease is not treated, it can spread to other parts of the body. This may lead to:\\n     - More rashes\\n     - Facial paralysis (like Bell's palsy)\\n     - Severe headaches\\n     - Neck stiffness\\n     - Heart palpitations\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Infection:**\\n   - This stage can occur months or years after the initial infection, causing chronic issues such as:\\n     - Arthritis\\n     - Cognitive problems (like memory issues)\\n     - Neurological complications, often referred to as Lyme encephalopathy\\n\\n## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis\\nLyme disease is mainly caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and similar species. The following describes how the bacteria works:\\n- The bacteria enter the body through the skin at the tick bite and can spread through the body's lymphatic system and bloodstream to various organs.\\n- The immune system's response to the infection leads to inflammation and potential damage to the heart, brain, and joints.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease typically involves:\\n- **Clinical Evaluation:** This involves looking at symptoms and confirming recent exposure to ticks, especially checking for the EM rash.\\n- **Laboratory Testing:** Blood tests are performed to look for antibodies against the Borrelia bacteria. The CDC suggests a two-step testing process: an initial Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) followed by a confirmation test known as Western blot.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment for Lyme disease depends on the stage of the disease:\\n- **Early Stage:** Oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline or amoxicillin, are commonly used and usually prescribed for 10 to 28 days.\\n- **Neurological or Cardiac Involvement:** More serious cases may require intravenous antibiotics, like ceftriaxone, depending on the symptoms.\\n- **Late Stage or Arthritis:** Chronic cases often require a more extended course of antibiotics to manage persistent symptoms.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventing Lyme disease revolves around minimizing risks of tick bites:\\n- Use insect repellents that contain DEET or picaridin.\\n- Wear protective clothing, like long sleeves and pants, when in areas where ticks are common.\\n- Perform body checks for ticks after activities performed outdoors.\\n- Consider using acaricides in residential areas to lower tick populations.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\nLyme disease is mostly found in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly thriving in temperate regions. The number of cases has significantly increased, largely due to environmental changes, shifting wildlife patterns, and urbanization that contribute to rising tick populations. Over 62,000 cases were reported in the U.S. in 2022, indicating a growing public health issue.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nLyme disease is an important public health issue that can lead to various health problems. Understanding how it spreads, recognizing the symptoms, and knowing the treatment options is essential for effective management and prevention of severe and lasting complications caused by the disease.\\n\\n## References\\n1.

It occurs when the immune system overreacts to inhaled allergens present in the environment. Despite its name, hay fever is not caused by hay, nor does it typically involve a fever. Rather, it is a reaction to tiny particles known as allergens, which can include pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and insect particles.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can vary in severity and include:\\n- **Sneezing**\\n- **Nasal congestion and runny nose**\\n- **Itchy eyes, nose, or throat**\\n- **Red or watery eyes**\\n- **Headaches and sinus pressure**\\n- **Fatigue and tiredness**\\n- **Sore throat from postnasal drip**\\n- **Wheezing or coughing**\\n\\nThese symptoms can occur year-round or seasonally, depending on the individual's triggers. Seasonal symptoms are typically worse in specific seasons, aligning with higher pollen counts.\\n\\n## Causes and Triggers\\nAllergic rhinitis occurs due to the body's immune response to allergens. Some common triggers include:\\n- **Outdoor Allergens**: Pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds is prominent in spring and fall.\\n- **Indoor Allergens**: Dust mites, mold, pet dander, and cockroach droppings can cause symptoms year-round.\\n  \\nIndividuals may experience seasonal allergies known as \\\"hay fever\\\" or perennial allergies that last throughout the year.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis often involves a thorough examination by a healthcare provider who will consider the patient's history and symptoms. Allergy tests, including skin prick tests and specific IgE blood tests, may be administered to identify particular allergens that trigger the symptoms.\\n\\n## Treatment and Management\\nWhile hay fever cannot be completely prevented, various treatment options can alleviate symptoms:\\n- **Antihistamines**: Over-the-counter medications like loratadine (Claritin) and cetirizine (Zyrtec) help block histamine, reducing sneezing and itching.\\n- **Decongestants**: Medications such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) relieve nasal congestion.\\n- **Corticosteroid Nasal Sprays**: Products like Flonase and Nasacort reduce inflammation in the nasal passages.\\n- **Leukotriene Inhibitors**: Such as montelukast (Singulair), help prevent allergic reactions.\\n- **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets can desensitize the immune system to allergens over time.\\n\\nLifestyle modifications also play a critical role in managing symptoms, such as avoiding known allergens, utilizing air filters, and practicing good hygiene.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nWhile complete prevention of hay fever is impossible, individuals can reduce exposure to allergens by:\\n- Keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons.\\n- Using air conditioning instead of opening windows.\\n- Regularly cleaning the home to reduce dust mites and mold.\\n- Washing bedding in hot water to eliminate dust mites.\\n- Wearing sunglasses and hats outdoors to protect against pollen.\\n\\n## Outlook\\nThe prognosis for individuals with hay fever is generally good. Most people can manage their symptoms effectively with appropriate treatments and lifestyle adjustments. However, those with asthma may find their symptoms exacerbated by hay fever, requiring additional management.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nHay fever, or allergic rhinitis, impacts a substantial percentage of the population, significantly affecting quality of life. Awareness of triggers, effective diagnosis, and a culmination of treatment strategies can help individuals lead healthier, more comfortable lives despite the challenge of allergies. \\n\\nFor a more detailed reading, please visit the source [Cleveland Clinic - Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever).\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"tasks_output\": [{\"description\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis) Make sure you find any relevant information of renowned sources.\\n\", \"name\": \"research_task\", \"expected_output\": \"A set of relevant information about Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis)\\n\", \"summary\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis) Make...\", \"raw\": \"Allergic rhinitis, also called hay fever, is an allergic reaction that causes sneezing, congestion, itchy nose, and watery eyes.

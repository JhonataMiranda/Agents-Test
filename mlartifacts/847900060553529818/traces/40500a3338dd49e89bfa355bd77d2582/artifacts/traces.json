These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

These symptoms occur when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, or pollen. Symptoms can also occur when you eat a food that you are allergic to. This article focuses on allergic rhinitis due to plant pollens. This type of allergic rhinitis is commonly called hay fever or seasonal allergy. Causes\\nAn allergen is something that triggers an allergy. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an allergen such as pollen, mold, animal dander, or dust, the body releases chemicals that cause allergy symptoms. Hay fever involves an allergic reaction to pollen. Plants that cause hay fever are trees, grasses, and ragweed. Their pollen is carried by the wind. Flower pollen is carried by insects and does not cause hay fever. Types of plants that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from area to area. The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop or not. Hot, dry, windy days are more likely to have a lot of pollen in the air. On cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground. Hay fever and allergies often run in families. If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies. Symptoms\\nSymptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include: Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area Problems with smell Runny nose Sneezing Watery eyes Symptoms that may develop later include: Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) Coughing Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell Sore throat Dark circles under the eyes Puffiness under the eyes Fatigue and irritability Headache Exams and Tests\\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked whether your symptoms vary by time of day or season, and exposure to pets or other allergens. Allergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. If your provider determines you cannot have skin testing, special blood tests may help with the diagnosis. These tests, known as IgE RAST tests, can measure the levels of allergy-related substances. A blood test, called the eosinophil count, may also help diagnose allergies. Treatment\\nLIFESTYLE AND AVOIDING ALLERGENS The best treatment is to avoid the pollens that cause your symptoms. It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often take steps to reduce your exposure . You may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your provider prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered. For mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose. You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of distilled or boiled then cooled water, half a teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and pinch of baking soda. Treatments for allergic rhinitis include: ANTIHISTAMINES Medicines called antihistamines work well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long. Be aware of the following: Many antihistamines taken by mouth can be bought without a prescription. Some can cause sleepiness. You should not drive or operate machines after taking this type of medicine. Others cause little or no sleepiness. Antihistamine nasal sprays work well for treating allergic rhinitis. Ask your provider if you should try these medicines first. Antihistamine eye drops can be used as needed for itchy, watery eyes. CORTICOSTEROIDS Nasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis. They work best when used nonstop, but they can also be helpful when used for shorter periods of time. They can even help when used intermittently. Corticosteroid sprays are generally safe for children and adults. Many brands are available without a prescription. For specific brands, you may need a prescription from your provider. DECONGESTANTS Decongestants may also be helpful for reducing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness. Do not use nasal spray decongestants for more than 3 days. OTHER MEDICINES Leukotriene inhibitors are prescription medicines that block leukotrienes. These are the chemicals the body releases in response to an allergen that also trigger symptoms. These medicines can cause side effects such as anxiety or depression in some people. Speak with your provider before starting these medications if you have a history of mental health issues. ALLERGY SHOTS Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the pollen and your symptoms are hard to control. This includes regular shots of the pollen you are allergic to. Each dose is slightly larger than the dose before it, until you reach the dose that helps control your symptoms. Allergy shots may help your body adjust to the pollen that is causing the reaction. SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT) Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies. Outlook (Prognosis)\\nMost symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be treated with medicines. More severe cases need allergy shots. Some people, especially children, may outgrow an allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the trigger. But once a substance such as pollen causes allergies, it often continues to have a long-term effect on the person. When to Contact a Medical Professional\\nContact your provider for an appointment if: You have severe hay fever symptoms Treatment that once worked for you no longer works Your symptoms do not respond to treatment Prevention\\nYou can sometimes prevent symptoms by avoiding the pollen you are allergic to. During pollen season, you should stay indoors where it is air-conditioned, if possible. Sleep with the windows closed, and drive with the windows rolled up.

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

These symptoms occur when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, or pollen. Symptoms can also occur when you eat a food that you are allergic to. This article focuses on allergic rhinitis due to plant pollens. This type of allergic rhinitis is commonly called hay fever or seasonal allergy. Causes\\nAn allergen is something that triggers an allergy. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an allergen such as pollen, mold, animal dander, or dust, the body releases chemicals that cause allergy symptoms. Hay fever involves an allergic reaction to pollen. Plants that cause hay fever are trees, grasses, and ragweed. Their pollen is carried by the wind. Flower pollen is carried by insects and does not cause hay fever. Types of plants that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from area to area. The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop or not. Hot, dry, windy days are more likely to have a lot of pollen in the air. On cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground. Hay fever and allergies often run in families. If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies. Symptoms\\nSymptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include: Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area Problems with smell Runny nose Sneezing Watery eyes Symptoms that may develop later include: Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) Coughing Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell Sore throat Dark circles under the eyes Puffiness under the eyes Fatigue and irritability Headache Exams and Tests\\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked whether your symptoms vary by time of day or season, and exposure to pets or other allergens. Allergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. If your provider determines you cannot have skin testing, special blood tests may help with the diagnosis. These tests, known as IgE RAST tests, can measure the levels of allergy-related substances. A blood test, called the eosinophil count, may also help diagnose allergies. Treatment\\nLIFESTYLE AND AVOIDING ALLERGENS The best treatment is to avoid the pollens that cause your symptoms. It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often take steps to reduce your exposure . You may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your provider prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered. For mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose. You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of distilled or boiled then cooled water, half a teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and pinch of baking soda. Treatments for allergic rhinitis include: ANTIHISTAMINES Medicines called antihistamines work well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long. Be aware of the following: Many antihistamines taken by mouth can be bought without a prescription. Some can cause sleepiness. You should not drive or operate machines after taking this type of medicine. Others cause little or no sleepiness. Antihistamine nasal sprays work well for treating allergic rhinitis. Ask your provider if you should try these medicines first. Antihistamine eye drops can be used as needed for itchy, watery eyes. CORTICOSTEROIDS Nasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis. They work best when used nonstop, but they can also be helpful when used for shorter periods of time. They can even help when used intermittently. Corticosteroid sprays are generally safe for children and adults. Many brands are available without a prescription. For specific brands, you may need a prescription from your provider. DECONGESTANTS Decongestants may also be helpful for reducing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness. Do not use nasal spray decongestants for more than 3 days. OTHER MEDICINES Leukotriene inhibitors are prescription medicines that block leukotrienes. These are the chemicals the body releases in response to an allergen that also trigger symptoms. These medicines can cause side effects such as anxiety or depression in some people. Speak with your provider before starting these medications if you have a history of mental health issues. ALLERGY SHOTS Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the pollen and your symptoms are hard to control. This includes regular shots of the pollen you are allergic to. Each dose is slightly larger than the dose before it, until you reach the dose that helps control your symptoms. Allergy shots may help your body adjust to the pollen that is causing the reaction. SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT) Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies. Outlook (Prognosis)\\nMost symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be treated with medicines. More severe cases need allergy shots. Some people, especially children, may outgrow an allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the trigger. But once a substance such as pollen causes allergies, it often continues to have a long-term effect on the person. When to Contact a Medical Professional\\nContact your provider for an appointment if: You have severe hay fever symptoms Treatment that once worked for you no longer works Your symptoms do not respond to treatment Prevention\\nYou can sometimes prevent symptoms by avoiding the pollen you are allergic to. During pollen season, you should stay indoors where it is air-conditioned, if possible. Sleep with the windows closed, and drive with the windows rolled up.

This condition is not caused by a viral infection but rather an immune response to harmless substances in the environment, termed allergens. Common allergens include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores, which can trigger the immune system into overreaction.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can significantly affect daily living and may include:\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**\\n- **Sneezing**\\n- **Itchy eyes, nose, or throat**\\n- **Coughing**\\n- **Dark circles under the eyes (\\\"allergic shiners\\\")**\\n- **Postnasal drip**\\n- **Fatigue and irritability**\\n- **Sinus pressure and headaches**\\n\\nSymptoms may either occur seasonally, influenced by outdoor allergens like tree and grass pollen, or perennial, as a response to indoor allergens such as pet dander and dust mites.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever triggers can be divided into seasonal and perennial categories:\\n- **Seasonal Triggers**:\\n  - Tree pollen (spring)\\n  - Grass pollen (late spring and summer)\\n  - Ragweed pollen (fall)\\n\\n- **Perennial Triggers**:\\n  - Dust mites and cockroach droppings (year-round)\\n  - Pet dander (year-round)\\n  - Spores from molds (can be seasonal or year-round)\\n\\n## Causes\\nThe immune system of an individual suffering from hay fever mistakenly identifies harmless allergens as detrimental. Upon inhalation of an allergen, immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies are produced, resulting in the release of chemicals such as histamine, leading to allergy symptoms.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nCertain factors may increase the likelihood of developing hay fever:\\n- Family history of allergies\\n- Pre-existing conditions like asthma or eczema\\n- Situational environments exposing individuals to higher levels of allergens\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis is typically made through physical examination, assessment of symptoms, and allergy testing, which may involve skin tests or blood tests to measure IgE levels. A healthcare provider may inquire about symptom triggers and reactions to better evaluate the patient's condition.\\n\\n## Treatment Options\\nEffective management of hay fever includes a combination of lifestyle changes and medications:\\n1. **Avoidance**: Reducing exposure to allergens is crucial.\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Block the effects of histamine (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine).\\n   - **Corticosteroid nasal sprays**: Reduce inflammation (e.g., Flonase).\\n   - **Decongestants**: Help alleviate nasal congestion (e.g., pseudoephedrine).\\n   - **Leukotriene inhibitors**: Target chemicals causing symptoms (e.g., montelukast).\\n3. **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets help desensitize the immune system to specific allergens.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo minimize symptoms, the following preventive measures are recommended:\\n- Staying indoors during high pollen seasons.\\n- Utilizing air conditioning and air filters in living spaces.\\n- Keeping windows closed in vehicles and homes.\\n- Showering and changing clothes after being outdoors.\\n\\n## Outlook\\nHay fever can significantly impact life quality but can be effectively managed with the right treatments and lifestyle adaptations.

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

Unlike a cold, hay fever is not caused by a virus but by an allergic response to substances (allergens) like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.\\n\\n**Symptoms**:\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Sneezing\\n- Itchy eyes, nose, or throat\\n- Cough\\n- Dark circles under the eyes (\\\"allergic shiners\\\")\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue and irritability\\n- Sinus pressure and headaches\\n\\nSymptoms can occur seasonally (triggered by pollen from trees, weeds, and grasses) or perennial (triggered by indoor allergens like pet dander and dust mites).\\n\\n**Triggers**:\\n- Tree pollen (early spring)\\n- Grass pollen (late spring to summer)\\n- Ragweed pollen (fall)\\n- Dust mites and cockroach droppings (year-round)\\n- Pet dander (year-round)\\n- Spores from molds (both seasonal and year-round)\\n\\n**Causes**: When an allergen is inhaled, the immune system mistakenly identifies it as harmful, leading to the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This triggers histamine release, causing allergy symptoms.\\n\\n**Risk Factors**:\\n- Family history of allergies\\n- Having conditions like asthma or eczema\\n- Being in environments with high allergen exposure\\n\\n**Diagnosis**: Healthcare providers can diagnose hay fever based on symptoms, physical examination, and allergy testing (skin tests or blood tests measuring IgE levels).\\n\\n**Treatment Options**:\\n1. **Avoidance**: Reducing exposure to allergens.\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Block histamine effects (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine).\\n   - **Corticosteroid nasal sprays**: Reduce inflammation (e.g., Flonase).\\n   - **Decongestants**: Alleviate nasal congestion (e.g., pseudoephedrine).\\n   - **Leukotriene inhibitors**: Block chemicals causing symptoms (e.g., montelukast).\\n3. **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets that gradually desensitize the immune system to specific allergens.\\n\\n**Prevention**:\\n- Stay indoors during high pollen seasons.\\n- Use air conditioning and air filters.\\n- Keep windows closed in vehicles and homes.\\n- Shower and change clothes after being outdoors.\\n\\n**Outlook**: While hay fever can significantly affect quality of life, it can be effectively managed with appropriate treatment and lifestyle adjustments. Symptoms may persist throughout a person's life, but some individuals may outgrow their allergies.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to sources like:\\n- [Mayo Clinic on Hay Fever](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- [Cleveland Clinic on Allergic Rhinitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- [MedlinePlus on Allergic Rhinitis](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000813.htm)\\n\\nBegin!

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

Unlike a cold, hay fever is not caused by a virus but by an allergic response to substances (allergens) like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.\\n\\n**Symptoms**:\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Sneezing\\n- Itchy eyes, nose, or throat\\n- Cough\\n- Dark circles under the eyes (\\\"allergic shiners\\\")\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue and irritability\\n- Sinus pressure and headaches\\n\\nSymptoms can occur seasonally (triggered by pollen from trees, weeds, and grasses) or perennial (triggered by indoor allergens like pet dander and dust mites).\\n\\n**Triggers**:\\n- Tree pollen (early spring)\\n- Grass pollen (late spring to summer)\\n- Ragweed pollen (fall)\\n- Dust mites and cockroach droppings (year-round)\\n- Pet dander (year-round)\\n- Spores from molds (both seasonal and year-round)\\n\\n**Causes**: When an allergen is inhaled, the immune system mistakenly identifies it as harmful, leading to the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This triggers histamine release, causing allergy symptoms.\\n\\n**Risk Factors**:\\n- Family history of allergies\\n- Having conditions like asthma or eczema\\n- Being in environments with high allergen exposure\\n\\n**Diagnosis**: Healthcare providers can diagnose hay fever based on symptoms, physical examination, and allergy testing (skin tests or blood tests measuring IgE levels).\\n\\n**Treatment Options**:\\n1. **Avoidance**: Reducing exposure to allergens.\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Block histamine effects (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine).\\n   - **Corticosteroid nasal sprays**: Reduce inflammation (e.g., Flonase).\\n   - **Decongestants**: Alleviate nasal congestion (e.g., pseudoephedrine).\\n   - **Leukotriene inhibitors**: Block chemicals causing symptoms (e.g., montelukast).\\n3. **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets that gradually desensitize the immune system to specific allergens.\\n\\n**Prevention**:\\n- Stay indoors during high pollen seasons.\\n- Use air conditioning and air filters.\\n- Keep windows closed in vehicles and homes.\\n- Shower and change clothes after being outdoors.\\n\\n**Outlook**: While hay fever can significantly affect quality of life, it can be effectively managed with appropriate treatment and lifestyle adjustments. Symptoms may persist throughout a person's life, but some individuals may outgrow their allergies.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to sources like:\\n- [Mayo Clinic on Hay Fever](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- [Cleveland Clinic on Allergic Rhinitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- [MedlinePlus on Allergic Rhinitis](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000813.htm)\\n\\nBegin!

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

Unlike a cold, hay fever is not caused by a virus but by an allergic response to substances (allergens) like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.\\n\\n**Symptoms**:\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Sneezing\\n- Itchy eyes, nose, or throat\\n- Cough\\n- Dark circles under the eyes (\\\"allergic shiners\\\")\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue and irritability\\n- Sinus pressure and headaches\\n\\nSymptoms can occur seasonally (triggered by pollen from trees, weeds, and grasses) or perennial (triggered by indoor allergens like pet dander and dust mites).\\n\\n**Triggers**:\\n- Tree pollen (early spring)\\n- Grass pollen (late spring to summer)\\n- Ragweed pollen (fall)\\n- Dust mites and cockroach droppings (year-round)\\n- Pet dander (year-round)\\n- Spores from molds (both seasonal and year-round)\\n\\n**Causes**: When an allergen is inhaled, the immune system mistakenly identifies it as harmful, leading to the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This triggers histamine release, causing allergy symptoms.\\n\\n**Risk Factors**:\\n- Family history of allergies\\n- Having conditions like asthma or eczema\\n- Being in environments with high allergen exposure\\n\\n**Diagnosis**: Healthcare providers can diagnose hay fever based on symptoms, physical examination, and allergy testing (skin tests or blood tests measuring IgE levels).\\n\\n**Treatment Options**:\\n1. **Avoidance**: Reducing exposure to allergens.\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Block histamine effects (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine).\\n   - **Corticosteroid nasal sprays**: Reduce inflammation (e.g., Flonase).\\n   - **Decongestants**: Alleviate nasal congestion (e.g., pseudoephedrine).\\n   - **Leukotriene inhibitors**: Block chemicals causing symptoms (e.g., montelukast).\\n3. **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets that gradually desensitize the immune system to specific allergens.\\n\\n**Prevention**:\\n- Stay indoors during high pollen seasons.\\n- Use air conditioning and air filters.\\n- Keep windows closed in vehicles and homes.\\n- Shower and change clothes after being outdoors.\\n\\n**Outlook**: While hay fever can significantly affect quality of life, it can be effectively managed with appropriate treatment and lifestyle adjustments. Symptoms may persist throughout a person's life, but some individuals may outgrow their allergies.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to sources like:\\n- [Mayo Clinic on Hay Fever](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- [Cleveland Clinic on Allergic Rhinitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- [MedlinePlus on Allergic Rhinitis](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000813.htm)\\n\\nBegin!

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

Unlike a cold, hay fever is not caused by a virus but by an allergic response to substances (allergens) like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.\\n\\n**Symptoms**:\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Sneezing\\n- Itchy eyes, nose, or throat\\n- Cough\\n- Dark circles under the eyes (\\\"allergic shiners\\\")\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue and irritability\\n- Sinus pressure and headaches\\n\\nSymptoms can occur seasonally (triggered by pollen from trees, weeds, and grasses) or perennial (triggered by indoor allergens like pet dander and dust mites).\\n\\n**Triggers**:\\n- Tree pollen (early spring)\\n- Grass pollen (late spring to summer)\\n- Ragweed pollen (fall)\\n- Dust mites and cockroach droppings (year-round)\\n- Pet dander (year-round)\\n- Spores from molds (both seasonal and year-round)\\n\\n**Causes**: When an allergen is inhaled, the immune system mistakenly identifies it as harmful, leading to the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This triggers histamine release, causing allergy symptoms.\\n\\n**Risk Factors**:\\n- Family history of allergies\\n- Having conditions like asthma or eczema\\n- Being in environments with high allergen exposure\\n\\n**Diagnosis**: Healthcare providers can diagnose hay fever based on symptoms, physical examination, and allergy testing (skin tests or blood tests measuring IgE levels).\\n\\n**Treatment Options**:\\n1. **Avoidance**: Reducing exposure to allergens.\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Block histamine effects (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine).\\n   - **Corticosteroid nasal sprays**: Reduce inflammation (e.g., Flonase).\\n   - **Decongestants**: Alleviate nasal congestion (e.g., pseudoephedrine).\\n   - **Leukotriene inhibitors**: Block chemicals causing symptoms (e.g., montelukast).\\n3. **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets that gradually desensitize the immune system to specific allergens.\\n\\n**Prevention**:\\n- Stay indoors during high pollen seasons.\\n- Use air conditioning and air filters.\\n- Keep windows closed in vehicles and homes.\\n- Shower and change clothes after being outdoors.\\n\\n**Outlook**: While hay fever can significantly affect quality of life, it can be effectively managed with appropriate treatment and lifestyle adjustments. Symptoms may persist throughout a person's life, but some individuals may outgrow their allergies.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to sources like:\\n- [Mayo Clinic on Hay Fever](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- [Cleveland Clinic on Allergic Rhinitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- [MedlinePlus on Allergic Rhinitis](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000813.htm)\\n\\nBegin!

These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).\\nCommon allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

These symptoms occur when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, or pollen. Symptoms can also occur when you eat a food that you are allergic to. This article focuses on allergic rhinitis due to plant pollens. This type of allergic rhinitis is commonly called hay fever or seasonal allergy. Causes\\nAn allergen is something that triggers an allergy. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an allergen such as pollen, mold, animal dander, or dust, the body releases chemicals that cause allergy symptoms. Hay fever involves an allergic reaction to pollen. Plants that cause hay fever are trees, grasses, and ragweed. Their pollen is carried by the wind. Flower pollen is carried by insects and does not cause hay fever. Types of plants that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from area to area. The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop or not. Hot, dry, windy days are more likely to have a lot of pollen in the air. On cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground. Hay fever and allergies often run in families. If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies. Symptoms\\nSymptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include: Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area Problems with smell Runny nose Sneezing Watery eyes Symptoms that may develop later include: Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) Coughing Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell Sore throat Dark circles under the eyes Puffiness under the eyes Fatigue and irritability Headache Exams and Tests\\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked whether your symptoms vary by time of day or season, and exposure to pets or other allergens. Allergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. If your provider determines you cannot have skin testing, special blood tests may help with the diagnosis. These tests, known as IgE RAST tests, can measure the levels of allergy-related substances. A blood test, called the eosinophil count, may also help diagnose allergies. Treatment\\nLIFESTYLE AND AVOIDING ALLERGENS The best treatment is to avoid the pollens that cause your symptoms. It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often take steps to reduce your exposure . You may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your provider prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered. For mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose. You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of distilled or boiled then cooled water, half a teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and pinch of baking soda. Treatments for allergic rhinitis include: ANTIHISTAMINES Medicines called antihistamines work well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long. Be aware of the following: Many antihistamines taken by mouth can be bought without a prescription. Some can cause sleepiness. You should not drive or operate machines after taking this type of medicine. Others cause little or no sleepiness. Antihistamine nasal sprays work well for treating allergic rhinitis. Ask your provider if you should try these medicines first. Antihistamine eye drops can be used as needed for itchy, watery eyes. CORTICOSTEROIDS Nasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis. They work best when used nonstop, but they can also be helpful when used for shorter periods of time. They can even help when used intermittently. Corticosteroid sprays are generally safe for children and adults. Many brands are available without a prescription. For specific brands, you may need a prescription from your provider. DECONGESTANTS Decongestants may also be helpful for reducing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness. Do not use nasal spray decongestants for more than 3 days. OTHER MEDICINES Leukotriene inhibitors are prescription medicines that block leukotrienes. These are the chemicals the body releases in response to an allergen that also trigger symptoms. These medicines can cause side effects such as anxiety or depression in some people. Speak with your provider before starting these medications if you have a history of mental health issues. ALLERGY SHOTS Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the pollen and your symptoms are hard to control. This includes regular shots of the pollen you are allergic to. Each dose is slightly larger than the dose before it, until you reach the dose that helps control your symptoms. Allergy shots may help your body adjust to the pollen that is causing the reaction. SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT) Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies. Outlook (Prognosis)\\nMost symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be treated with medicines. More severe cases need allergy shots. Some people, especially children, may outgrow an allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the trigger. But once a substance such as pollen causes allergies, it often continues to have a long-term effect on the person. When to Contact a Medical Professional\\nContact your provider for an appointment if: You have severe hay fever symptoms Treatment that once worked for you no longer works Your symptoms do not respond to treatment Prevention\\nYou can sometimes prevent symptoms by avoiding the pollen you are allergic to. During pollen season, you should stay indoors where it is air-conditioned, if possible. Sleep with the windows closed, and drive with the windows rolled up.

Unlike a cold, hay fever is not caused by a virus but by an allergic response to substances (allergens) like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.\\n\\n**Symptoms**:\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Sneezing\\n- Itchy eyes, nose, or throat\\n- Cough\\n- Dark circles under the eyes (\\\"allergic shiners\\\")\\n- Postnasal drip\\n- Fatigue and irritability\\n- Sinus pressure and headaches\\n\\nSymptoms can occur seasonally (triggered by pollen from trees, weeds, and grasses) or perennial (triggered by indoor allergens like pet dander and dust mites).\\n\\n**Triggers**:\\n- Tree pollen (early spring)\\n- Grass pollen (late spring to summer)\\n- Ragweed pollen (fall)\\n- Dust mites and cockroach droppings (year-round)\\n- Pet dander (year-round)\\n- Spores from molds (both seasonal and year-round)\\n\\n**Causes**: When an allergen is inhaled, the immune system mistakenly identifies it as harmful, leading to the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This triggers histamine release, causing allergy symptoms.\\n\\n**Risk Factors**:\\n- Family history of allergies\\n- Having conditions like asthma or eczema\\n- Being in environments with high allergen exposure\\n\\n**Diagnosis**: Healthcare providers can diagnose hay fever based on symptoms, physical examination, and allergy testing (skin tests or blood tests measuring IgE levels).\\n\\n**Treatment Options**:\\n1. **Avoidance**: Reducing exposure to allergens.\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Block histamine effects (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine).\\n   - **Corticosteroid nasal sprays**: Reduce inflammation (e.g., Flonase).\\n   - **Decongestants**: Alleviate nasal congestion (e.g., pseudoephedrine).\\n   - **Leukotriene inhibitors**: Block chemicals causing symptoms (e.g., montelukast).\\n3. **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets that gradually desensitize the immune system to specific allergens.\\n\\n**Prevention**:\\n- Stay indoors during high pollen seasons.\\n- Use air conditioning and air filters.\\n- Keep windows closed in vehicles and homes.\\n- Shower and change clothes after being outdoors.\\n\\n**Outlook**: While hay fever can significantly affect quality of life, it can be effectively managed with appropriate treatment and lifestyle adjustments. Symptoms may persist throughout a person's life, but some individuals may outgrow their allergies.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to sources like:\\n- [Mayo Clinic on Hay Fever](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- [Cleveland Clinic on Allergic Rhinitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- [MedlinePlus on Allergic Rhinitis](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000813.htm)\\n\\nBegin!

Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.\\nBesides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.\\nRisk factors The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:\\nHaving other allergies or asthma.\\nHaving a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.\\nHaving a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.\\nLiving or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.\\nBeing exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.\\nHaving a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\\nComplications Problems that may go along with hay fever include:\\nReduced quality of life. Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.\\nPoor sleep. Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.\\nWorsening asthma. Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.\\nSinusitis. Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.\\nEar infection. In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.\\nPrevention There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

What is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is an  allergic reaction  to tiny particles in the air called allergens. When you breathe in allergens through your nose or mouth, your body reacts by releasing a natural chemical called histamine . Despite being called hay fever, hay doesn’t cause hay fever and most people don’t get a fever. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, nasal congestion and irritation of your nose, throat, mouth and eyes. Allergic rhinitis isn’t the same as infectious rhinitis, otherwise known as the  common cold . Hay fever isn’t contagious. Also, not all rhinitis is allergic. Many people suffer from nonallergic rhinitis resulting in similar symptoms. Inflammation causes rhinitis, not allergens or histamine release. What triggers allergic rhinitis? Several indoor and outdoor allergens cause hay fever. Common hay fever triggers include: Pollen from trees, weeds and plants. Mold spores . Pet dander . Dust mites . Cockroach droppings and saliva. When do people usually get hay fever? You can have hay fever any time of the year. Seasonal allergies occur in the spring, summer and early fall when trees and weeds bloom and pollen counts are higher. But pollen seasons can vary depending on your location, as well. Perennial allergies can happen year-round. They result from irritants that are always around, such as pet dander, cockroaches and dust mites. How common is allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever is very common. In the United States, around 20% of the population has allergic rhinitis. In 2021, one study found that more than 81 million people had seasonal allergies. Symptoms and Causes Symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) occur when your immune system overreacts to something in your environment. What are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever)? Hay fever symptoms can appear throughout the year. Outdoor allergies are worse in the spring, summer and early fall depending on where you live. In warm weather, weeds and flowers bloom, and pollen counts are higher. Indoor allergies, such as those from pets and dust mites, can get worse in winter because people spend more time indoors with their windows closed. Advertisement Symptoms of hay fever include: Nasal stuffiness (congestion), sneezing and runny nose. Itchy nose, throat and eyes. Red or watery eyes. Headaches, sinus pressure and dark circles under your eyes. More mucus in your nose and throat. Tiredness. Sore throat from mucus dripping down your throat ( postnasal drip ). Wheezing, coughing and trouble breathing. How do I know if it’s hay fever or a cold? Symptoms of a cold and hay fever are similar, but there are some differences. Itchy, red and watery eyes are common with allergies, but not as common with a cold. A cold is more likely to cause muscle aches and pain or a fever. Another way people can tell the difference is that allergic rhinitis usually has a trigger, like seasons changing or being around a new pet. Allergies often happen at the same time each year, like in spring and late summer, and they start quickly. On the other hand, a virus causes a cold and you catch viruses from other people. So, you may know it’s a cold if you’ve been around someone with a cold. A cold tends to go away within a week, whereas allergies will stick around until the allergen is out of the air. What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Allergic rhinitis occurs when your body’s  immune system  reacts to an irritant in the air. The irritants (allergens) are so tiny that you can easily inhale them through your nose or mouth. Allergens are harmless to most people. But if you have hay fever, your immune system thinks the allergen is intruding. Your immune system tries to protect your body by releasing natural chemicals into your bloodstream. The main chemical is called histamine. It causes mucous membranes in your nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen from your body. Allergic rhinitis comes from many allergens, including: Dust mites that live in carpets, drapes, bedding and furniture. Pollen from trees, grass and weeds. Pet dander (tiny flakes of dead skin cells). Mold spores. Cockroaches (their saliva and waste). Food allergies  can also cause inflammation in your nose and throat. Food allergies can be life-threatening, so get medical help right away if you’re concerned that a certain food is consistently causing allergy symptoms. What are the risk factors for hay fever? Allergies are inherited, which means you’re more likely to have hay fever if you have a parent or immediate family member with allergies. People who have  asthma  or  eczema  are also more likely to develop hay fever. Diagnosis and Tests How is hay fever diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you, ask about your symptoms and evaluate you for other conditions, such as a cold or asthma. They can also perform allergy tests . Advertisement A blood allergy test measures antibodies to an allergen in a sample of your blood. This blood test is called an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test. It can detect most types of allergies, including food allergies. Your provider may also recommend a skin prick and/or intradermal test to determine what allergens are causing your symptoms. In a skin prick test, your provider places a small sample of different allergens on your skin (usually on your forearm or back). They scratch or prick your skin with a needle. If you’re allergic to a specific allergen, the area will become red, itchy and irritated in 15 to 30 minutes. Intradermal testing is similar, but your allergist places the allergen underneath your skin. Your skin reacts in the same way it does for a prick test. Management and Treatment How do you get rid of hay fever (allergic rhinitis)? Several  allergy medications  can improve symptoms and help you live with hay fever. These treatments come in many forms, including liquids, pills, eye drops, nasal sprays and injections. Talk to your provider before taking any medication, especially if you’re pregnant or have other health concerns. Antihistamines Antihistamine medications are available with a prescription or over the counter (OTC). They work by blocking the histamine that your body releases during an allergic response. Antihistamines come as pills, liquids, eye drops, nasal sprays and inhalers. They include: Advertisement Loratadine (Claritin®). Cetirizine (Zyrtec®). Fexofenadine (Allegra®). Levocetirizine (Xyzal®). Antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines, especially if you’re going to drive. Decongestants These medications relieve congestion in your nose and sinuses. You can take decongestants by mouth (in pill or liquid form) or use a nasal spray. They include: Afrin® nasal spray. Phenylephrine nasal spray (Neo-Synephrine®). Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed®). Decongestants can increase blood pressure and cause headaches, trouble sleeping and irritability. Nasal decongestants can be addictive when you use them for longer than five days. Corticosteroid nasal sprays These sprays and inhalers reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of hay fever. The most common nasal sprays are Flonase®, Nasacort® and Rhinocort®. Side effects include headaches, nasal irritation, nosebleeds and cough. Leukotriene inhibitors During an allergic reaction, your body releases leukotrienes, histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and hay fever symptoms. Available only with a prescription, these pills block leukotriene. The most common leukotriene inhibitor is montelukast (Singulair®). Some people experience changes in mood, vivid dreams, involuntary muscle movements and skin rash when taking this medication. Advertisement Immunotherapy This treatment works by helping your body learn to tolerate allergens. Your provider gives you a series of injections (allergy shots or subcutaneous immunotherapy) with a small amount of the allergen. Every time you get a shot, your provider increases the amount of the allergen. Over time, your immune system develops immunity to the allergen and stops launching a reaction to it. In certain circumstances, your provider might recommend immunotherapy in the form of a pill that you place under your tongue called oral immunotherapy. Currently, oral immunotherapy is only available for allergies to trees, grass and dust mites (in the U.S.). How many days does allergic rhinitis last? It varies. Most people find relief from hay fever within a few days with medication, but they must take it continuously until the allergen is out of the air. Some people continue to have symptoms of hay fever for several weeks or months, especially if they aren’t taking or can’t take medication to help relieve symptoms. Care at Cleveland Clinic Allergy Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialist Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent hay fever? There’s no way to prevent hay fever, but lifestyle changes can help you live with allergies. You can relieve hay fever symptoms by avoiding irritants as much as possible. To reduce symptoms, you should: Avoid touching your face and rubbing your eyes or nose. Close windows in your home and car during the spring, summer and early fall when pollen counts are higher. Put covers on pillows, mattresses and box springs to protect against dust mites. Keep pets off couches and beds, and close doors to bedrooms you don’t want them to enter. Use filters in your vacuum cleaner and air conditioner to reduce the amount of allergens in the air. Wash your hands often, especially after playing with pets. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen when you’re outside. Change your clothes as soon as you come indoors. Outlook / Prognosis What is the outlook for people who have hay fever? Hay fever can make you feel miserable, but it generally doesn’t cause serious health problems. Most people with hay fever manage symptoms with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. People with airborne allergies have a higher risk of ear infections and sinus infections . Because hay fever can make it tough to get a good night’s sleep, you may feel tired during the day. If you have asthma, hay fever can make your asthma symptoms worse. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about hay fever? Although hay fever usually doesn’t cause any serious health problems, you should see your provider to rule out other conditions, such as asthma or a sinus infection. Seek care if hay fever symptoms are: Getting in the way of your daily life. Making it hard for you to sleep. Not improving with allergy medication. Your provider can help you identify the allergens that are causing a reaction and recommend treatments to help you feel better. Additional Common Questions What’s the difference between hay fever and allergies? Hay fever is another name for allergic rhinitis. Hay fever mainly refers to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which is the allergies you experience at certain times of the year due to pollen from grass, weeds and trees. But some people use the terms interchangeably. When do most people get seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to occur in the spring and early fall when pollen from grass, trees and ragweed are more prevalent. How do you know if you have seasonal allergies? Seasonal allergies tend to happen at the same time each year. They often start suddenly and can last several weeks or until the allergen isn’t in the air anymore. Taking allergy medication to see if it improves your symptoms is one way to know if your symptoms are due to allergies. Checking a weather app or website to see if pollen is high in your area can also help you decide if what you feel is related to seasonal allergies.

These symptoms occur when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, or pollen. Symptoms can also occur when you eat a food that you are allergic to. This article focuses on allergic rhinitis due to plant pollens. This type of allergic rhinitis is commonly called hay fever or seasonal allergy. Causes\\nAn allergen is something that triggers an allergy. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an allergen such as pollen, mold, animal dander, or dust, the body releases chemicals that cause allergy symptoms. Hay fever involves an allergic reaction to pollen. Plants that cause hay fever are trees, grasses, and ragweed. Their pollen is carried by the wind. Flower pollen is carried by insects and does not cause hay fever. Types of plants that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from area to area. The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop or not. Hot, dry, windy days are more likely to have a lot of pollen in the air. On cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground. Hay fever and allergies often run in families. If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies. Symptoms\\nSymptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include: Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area Problems with smell Runny nose Sneezing Watery eyes Symptoms that may develop later include: Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) Coughing Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell Sore throat Dark circles under the eyes Puffiness under the eyes Fatigue and irritability Headache Exams and Tests\\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked whether your symptoms vary by time of day or season, and exposure to pets or other allergens. Allergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. If your provider determines you cannot have skin testing, special blood tests may help with the diagnosis. These tests, known as IgE RAST tests, can measure the levels of allergy-related substances. A blood test, called the eosinophil count, may also help diagnose allergies. Treatment\\nLIFESTYLE AND AVOIDING ALLERGENS The best treatment is to avoid the pollens that cause your symptoms. It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often take steps to reduce your exposure . You may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your provider prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered. For mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose. You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of distilled or boiled then cooled water, half a teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and pinch of baking soda. Treatments for allergic rhinitis include: ANTIHISTAMINES Medicines called antihistamines work well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long. Be aware of the following: Many antihistamines taken by mouth can be bought without a prescription. Some can cause sleepiness. You should not drive or operate machines after taking this type of medicine. Others cause little or no sleepiness. Antihistamine nasal sprays work well for treating allergic rhinitis. Ask your provider if you should try these medicines first. Antihistamine eye drops can be used as needed for itchy, watery eyes. CORTICOSTEROIDS Nasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis. They work best when used nonstop, but they can also be helpful when used for shorter periods of time. They can even help when used intermittently. Corticosteroid sprays are generally safe for children and adults. Many brands are available without a prescription. For specific brands, you may need a prescription from your provider. DECONGESTANTS Decongestants may also be helpful for reducing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness. Do not use nasal spray decongestants for more than 3 days. OTHER MEDICINES Leukotriene inhibitors are prescription medicines that block leukotrienes. These are the chemicals the body releases in response to an allergen that also trigger symptoms. These medicines can cause side effects such as anxiety or depression in some people. Speak with your provider before starting these medications if you have a history of mental health issues. ALLERGY SHOTS Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the pollen and your symptoms are hard to control. This includes regular shots of the pollen you are allergic to. Each dose is slightly larger than the dose before it, until you reach the dose that helps control your symptoms. Allergy shots may help your body adjust to the pollen that is causing the reaction. SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT) Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies. Outlook (Prognosis)\\nMost symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be treated with medicines. More severe cases need allergy shots. Some people, especially children, may outgrow an allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the trigger. But once a substance such as pollen causes allergies, it often continues to have a long-term effect on the person. When to Contact a Medical Professional\\nContact your provider for an appointment if: You have severe hay fever symptoms Treatment that once worked for you no longer works Your symptoms do not respond to treatment Prevention\\nYou can sometimes prevent symptoms by avoiding the pollen you are allergic to. During pollen season, you should stay indoors where it is air-conditioned, if possible. Sleep with the windows closed, and drive with the windows rolled up.

This condition is not caused by a viral infection but rather an immune response to harmless substances in the environment, termed allergens. Common allergens include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores, which can trigger the immune system into overreaction.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can significantly affect daily living and may include:\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**\\n- **Sneezing**\\n- **Itchy eyes, nose, or throat**\\n- **Coughing**\\n- **Dark circles under the eyes (\\\"allergic shiners\\\")**\\n- **Postnasal drip**\\n- **Fatigue and irritability**\\n- **Sinus pressure and headaches**\\n\\nSymptoms may either occur seasonally, influenced by outdoor allergens like tree and grass pollen, or perennial, as a response to indoor allergens such as pet dander and dust mites.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever triggers can be divided into seasonal and perennial categories:\\n- **Seasonal Triggers**:\\n  - Tree pollen (spring)\\n  - Grass pollen (late spring and summer)\\n  - Ragweed pollen (fall)\\n\\n- **Perennial Triggers**:\\n  - Dust mites and cockroach droppings (year-round)\\n  - Pet dander (year-round)\\n  - Spores from molds (can be seasonal or year-round)\\n\\n## Causes\\nThe immune system of an individual suffering from hay fever mistakenly identifies harmless allergens as detrimental. Upon inhalation of an allergen, immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies are produced, resulting in the release of chemicals such as histamine, leading to allergy symptoms.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nCertain factors may increase the likelihood of developing hay fever:\\n- Family history of allergies\\n- Pre-existing conditions like asthma or eczema\\n- Situational environments exposing individuals to higher levels of allergens\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis is typically made through physical examination, assessment of symptoms, and allergy testing, which may involve skin tests or blood tests to measure IgE levels. A healthcare provider may inquire about symptom triggers and reactions to better evaluate the patient's condition.\\n\\n## Treatment Options\\nEffective management of hay fever includes a combination of lifestyle changes and medications:\\n1. **Avoidance**: Reducing exposure to allergens is crucial.\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Block the effects of histamine (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine).\\n   - **Corticosteroid nasal sprays**: Reduce inflammation (e.g., Flonase).\\n   - **Decongestants**: Help alleviate nasal congestion (e.g., pseudoephedrine).\\n   - **Leukotriene inhibitors**: Target chemicals causing symptoms (e.g., montelukast).\\n3. **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets help desensitize the immune system to specific allergens.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo minimize symptoms, the following preventive measures are recommended:\\n- Staying indoors during high pollen seasons.\\n- Utilizing air conditioning and air filters in living spaces.\\n- Keeping windows closed in vehicles and homes.\\n- Showering and changing clothes after being outdoors.\\n\\n## Outlook\\nHay fever can significantly impact life quality but can be effectively managed with the right treatments and lifestyle adaptations. While symptoms may persist, many individuals can successfully learn to manage their hay fever or even outgrow their allergies over time.\\n\\nFor further details, refer to sources such as:\\n- [Mayo Clinic on Hay Fever](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- [Cleveland Clinic on Allergic Rhinitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- [MedlinePlus on Allergic Rhinitis](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000813.htm)\\n\\nBegin!

Common allergens include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores, which can trigger the immune system into overreaction.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of hay fever can significantly affect daily living and may include:\\n- **Runny or stuffy nose**\\n- **Sneezing**\\n- **Itchy eyes, nose, or throat**\\n- **Coughing**\\n- **Dark circles under the eyes (\\\"allergic shiners\\\")**\\n- **Postnasal drip**\\n- **Fatigue and irritability**\\n- **Sinus pressure and headaches**\\n\\nSymptoms may either occur seasonally, influenced by outdoor allergens like tree and grass pollen, or perennial, as a response to indoor allergens such as pet dander and dust mites.\\n\\n## Triggers\\nHay fever triggers can be divided into seasonal and perennial categories:\\n- **Seasonal Triggers**:\\n  - Tree pollen (spring)\\n  - Grass pollen (late spring and summer)\\n  - Ragweed pollen (fall)\\n\\n- **Perennial Triggers**:\\n  - Dust mites and cockroach droppings (year-round)\\n  - Pet dander (year-round)\\n  - Spores from molds (can be seasonal or year-round)\\n\\n## Causes\\nThe immune system of an individual suffering from hay fever mistakenly identifies harmless allergens as detrimental. Upon inhalation of an allergen, immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies are produced, resulting in the release of chemicals such as histamine, leading to allergy symptoms.\\n\\n## Risk Factors\\nCertain factors may increase the likelihood of developing hay fever:\\n- Family history of allergies\\n- Pre-existing conditions like asthma or eczema\\n- Situational environments exposing individuals to higher levels of allergens\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis is typically made through physical examination, assessment of symptoms, and allergy testing, which may involve skin tests or blood tests to measure IgE levels. A healthcare provider may inquire about symptom triggers and reactions to better evaluate the patient's condition.\\n\\n## Treatment Options\\nEffective management of hay fever includes a combination of lifestyle changes and medications:\\n1. **Avoidance**: Reducing exposure to allergens is crucial.\\n2. **Medications**:\\n   - **Antihistamines**: Block the effects of histamine (e.g., loratadine, cetirizine).\\n   - **Corticosteroid nasal sprays**: Reduce inflammation (e.g., Flonase).\\n   - **Decongestants**: Help alleviate nasal congestion (e.g., pseudoephedrine).\\n   - **Leukotriene inhibitors**: Target chemicals causing symptoms (e.g., montelukast).\\n3. **Immunotherapy**: Allergy shots or sublingual tablets help desensitize the immune system to specific allergens.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo minimize symptoms, the following preventive measures are recommended:\\n- Staying indoors during high pollen seasons.\\n- Utilizing air conditioning and air filters in living spaces.\\n- Keeping windows closed in vehicles and homes.\\n- Showering and changing clothes after being outdoors.\\n\\n## Outlook\\nHay fever can significantly impact life quality but can be effectively managed with the right treatments and lifestyle adaptations. While symptoms may persist, many individuals can successfully learn to manage their hay fever or even outgrow their allergies over time.\\n\\nFor further details, refer to sources such as:\\n- [Mayo Clinic on Hay Fever](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039)\\n- [Cleveland Clinic on Allergic Rhinitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8622-allergic-rhinitis-hay-fever)\\n- [MedlinePlus on Allergic Rhinitis](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000813.htm)\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}, {\"description\": \"Using the information received, write a report, translating very technical terms into more common language.

It is caused by over 200 different viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common type. Colds are highly contagious and can easily spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. You can also get a cold by touching surfaces that have the virus on them and then touching your face. Colds are a major reason for people missing school and work due to their high infection rate.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms usually show up 1 to 3 days after being exposed to the virus and can vary in severity and duration. Here are the main symptoms:\\n- **Runny or Stuffy Nose:** Often the first symptom you notice.\\n- **Sneezing:** A reflex action resulting from irritation in the nasal passages.\\n- **Sore or Scratchy Throat:** Commonly felt in the beginning stages of the illness.\\n- **Cough:** This can range from mild to severe and might cause discomfort.\\n- **Mild Fatigue:** Feeling generally tired may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Low-Grade Fever:** More common in children and might not happen in adults.\\n- **Body Aches:** You may experience mild to moderate muscle aches.\\n\\nThese symptoms usually reach their peak within 2 to 3 days and last about a week. Mucus might shift from clear to thick or discolored (yellow or green), but this doesn't always mean you have a bacterial infection.\\n\\n## Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last for about 7 to 10 days. Adults typically get two to three colds per year, while children can get colds more often due to their less developed immune systems. There isn't a cure for the common cold; however, symptoms can be effectively managed with over-the-counter medications, which help you feel more comfortable while your body fights off the virus.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreating the common cold focuses mainly on relieving symptoms while your body heals. Common treatment options include:\\n- **Pain Relievers:** Such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) to ease discomfort.\\n- **Decongestants:** Like pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) for clearing nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines:** To help reduce sneezing and running nose.\\n- **Cough Suppressants and Expectorants:** Such as dextromethorphan for cough relief and guaifenesin to loosen mucus.\\n\\nSince colds are caused by viruses, antibiotics don't work on them. However, doctors might prescribe antibiotics if complications arise, such as bronchitis or sinus infections.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nAs there is no vaccine for the common cold, taking steps to prevent infection is essential. Effective preventive measures include:\\n- **Frequent Handwashing:** Use soap and water, especially after being in public and before eating.\\n- **Using Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers:** Handy when soap is not available.\\n- **Avoid Touching the Face:** Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\\n- **Regular Cleaning and Disinfecting:** Pay attention to frequently touched surfaces like doorknobs and phones.\\n- **Social Distancing:** Stay away from people known to be sick with colds.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile most colds are harmless, they can lead to complications in some people. Potential complications include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections:** Fluid builds up behind the eardrum, especially in children.\\n- **Sinusitis:** Inflammation of the sinuses that can cause pain and pressure.\\n- **Worsening Asthma:** Colds can trigger asthma symptoms in those who have it.\\n- **Pneumonia:** A serious issue for those with weakened immune systems.\\n\\n## When to Seek Medical Attention\\nMonitoring your symptoms is vital. Adults should seek care if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few days.\\n- A fever over 101.3°F (38.5°C) lasts for more than 3 days.\\n- Severe headaches or intense sore throats develop.\\n\\nIf it’s a child, parents should consult a healthcare provider if:\\n- Infants show a fever of more than 100.4°F (38°C).\\n- Symptoms are severe, persistent, or getting worse.\\n\\nGetting medical attention can help prevent complications or misdiagnosis.\\n\\n## Additional Information\\nFor further information on the common cold, you can visit these resources:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n\\nThis report offers a comprehensive look at the common cold, outlining its symptoms, treatment options, prevention strategies, and when to seek medical help, enhancing understanding of this prevalent viral infection.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"tasks_output\": [{\"description\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Common Cold Make sure you find any relevant information of renowned sources.\\n\", \"name\": \"research_task\", \"expected_output\": \"A set of relevant information about Common Cold\\n\", \"summary\": \"Conduct a thorough research about Common Cold Make sure you...\", \"raw\": \"### Common Cold Overview\\nThe common cold is a viral infection affecting the upper respiratory tract.

It is caused by more than 200 different viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds are highly contagious and can spread easily within households, schools, and workplaces. \\n\\n### Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and can include:\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Sneezing\\n- Sore or scratchy throat\\n- Cough\\n- Mild fatigue\\n- Low-grade fever (more common in children)\\n- Body aches\\n\\nThese symptoms can vary from mild to moderate and usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection. The mucus from the nose may change from clear to thick and yellow or green, which does not necessarily indicate a bacterial infection.\\n\\n### Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last about 7 to 10 days. Generally, adults experience two to three colds per year, while children may have more frequent infections. While there is no cure, symptoms can be managed with over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers and cough suppressants.\\n\\n### Treatment\\nTreatment options primarily focus on symptom relief, as colds typically resolve on their own:\\n- **Pain Relievers:** Such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen).\\n- **Decongestants:** Such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed).\\n- **Antihistamines:** For reducing sneezing and runny nose.\\n- **Cough Suppressants and Expectorants:** To help manage coughing.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viral infections like colds but may be prescribed if bacterial complications arise, such as bronchitis or sinus infections.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nWhile there is no vaccine for the common cold, certain preventative measures can help reduce infection rates:\\n- Frequent handwashing with soap and water.\\n- Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap is unavailable.\\n- Avoiding touching the face with unwashed hands.\\n- Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\\n- Staying away from individuals known to have colds.\\n\\n### Complications\\nThough most colds are harmless, some potential complications can include:\\n- Middle ear infections\\n- Sinusitis\\n- Exacerbation of asthma\\n- Pneumonia, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems.\\n\\n### When to Seek Medical Attention\\nAdults should seek care if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or do not improve.\\n- Fever exceeds 101.3°F (38.5°C) lasting more than 3 days.\\n- Severe headache or intense sore throat occurs.\\n\\nParents should have their children evaluated if:\\n- Infants have a fever over 100.4°F (38°C).\\n- Symptoms are severe or persistent.\\n\\nFor ongoing concerns or if symptoms worsen significantly, consulting a healthcare provider is recommended.\\n\\n### Additional Information\\nMore detailed information about the common cold can be found at health resources such as the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605), and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html).\\n\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Common Cold Senior Data Researcher\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_1", "context": {"span_id": "0x3ace29a48fc89a9b", "trace_id": "0x2ac19a993e0c38a6cd2124eb510f793d"}, "parent_id": "0xab7b123150fdceb3", "start_time": 1742647932163515469, "end_time": 1742647955979742280, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"e9694372029f4d10b5f8467ea30c46b8\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"\", \"tools\": [{\"name\": \"Search the internet with Serper\", \"description\": \"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold?

If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\\nCover your cough. Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.\\nDon't share. Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.\\nStay away from people with colds. Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.\\nA cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by:\\nDroplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.\\nHand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.\\nSharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.\\nTouching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.\\nRisk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:\\nAge. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\\nCover your cough. Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.\\nDon't share. Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.\\nStay away from people with colds. Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.\\nReview your child care center's policies. Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.\\nTake care of yourself. Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nMay 24, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nAAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:\\nRunny nose or nasal congestion\\nCough\\nSneezing\\nSore throat\\nHeadache\\nMild body aches\\nFever (usually low grade in older children and adults)\\nComplications\\nComplications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:\\nMild to moderate:\\nMiddle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)\\nSinus infections\\nPotentially severe:\\nAsthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)\\nBronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)\\nBronchitis (infection of the large airways)\\nPneumonia (infection of the lungs)\\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)\\nSome respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness . This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.\\nCauses and spread\\nCauses\\nMore than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses , adenoviruses , enteroviruses (including EV-D68 ), and human metapneumovirus .\\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested , especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.\\nSpread\\nDifferent respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.

Here’s how to tell which is which. What is the common cold? A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe ( trachea ). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy We call colds “common” because as their name implies, they’re widespread. You’ll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year. Symptoms and Causes Early symptoms of the common cold include sore throat, runny nose and coughing. What are the symptoms of the common cold? Common cold symptoms typically appear in stages. The common cold stages include early, active and late. Stage 1: Early (Days 1 to 3) Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include: Sneezing. Runny nose. Stuffy nose (nasal congestion). Cough. Hoarseness . Stage 2: Active (Days 4 to 7) Symptoms typically worsen or peak during this stage. In addition to the symptoms in stage 1, you may experience: Body aches. Headache. Runny eyes and nose. Fatigue . Fever (more common in children). Stage 3: Late (Days 8 to 10) Colds usually begin to wind down during this stage. You may be free and clear at this point. But some symptoms can persist. Some people develop a nagging cough that can last up to two months after a respiratory infection. If your symptoms get worse and/or your fever returns, make a trip to a healthcare provider. You may have developed another infection or a complication, such as bronchitis, sinusitis or pneumonia. Advertisement What are the symptoms of the common cold in babies? Symptoms of colds in babies may include: Runny nose (the discharge may start clear; later, it becomes thicker and may be gray, yellow or green). Sneezing. Fever of 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius). Loss of appetite . Increased drooling because of sore throat and difficulty swallowing . Cough. Irritability. Slightly swollen glands. How do cold symptoms differ from more severe infections in babies and children? If your child has any of the following symptoms, call their healthcare provider. These symptoms could mean that your child has something more serious than a cold: Fever in an infant 2 months or younger. Difficulty breathing (especially if your baby’s or child’s nostrils widen with each breath). Fast or labored breathing. Wheezing . Ribs showing with each breath. Blue lips . Not eating or drinking, which could mean dehydration . Ear pain . Excessive crankiness or sleepiness. A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks. Your baby seems to be getting sicker. What causes the common cold? Rhinoviruses cause up to 50% of common colds. There are more than 100 different rhinoviruses. But other types of viruses, such as coronaviruses, can also cause colds. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold. Is the common cold contagious? Yes. Colds spread easily from person to person. For you to become infected, the virus has to get to one of your mucous membranes — the moist lining of your nostrils, eyes or mouth. That happens when you touch a surface or breathe moist air that contains the cold virus. For example, when a person who’s sick sneezes or coughs, they launch droplets of fluid containing the cold virus into the air. If you breathe in those droplets, the cold virus takes root in your nose. You can also leave virus particles on surfaces you touch when you’re sick. If someone else touches those surfaces and then touches their nostrils, eyes or mouth, the virus can get in. How long is the common cold contagious? You can be contagious for up to two weeks, even spreading a cold a day or two before you have symptoms. But you’re most contagious when your symptoms are at their worst — usually the first three days you feel sick. What is the common cold incubation period? The incubation period is the time between when you’re infected and when your symptoms first appear. The common cold incubation period is between 12 hours and three days after exposure to the virus. Why do children and babies get more colds? The common cold in children and babies occurs more often because they haven’t been exposed to as many viruses as adults. Their immune systems have to learn how to recognize and fight new germs. Before turning 2 years old, a baby can get as many as eight to 10 colds a year. By the time you become an adult, you’ve had many colds. It’s easier for your immune system to identify and attack similar viruses. Advertisement In addition, children are in close contact with other children. Kids typically don’t cover their coughs and sneezes or wash their hands before touching their faces — steps that prevent the virus from spreading. Cold viruses can live on objects for several hours. Babies often pick up objects that other babies have touched. If a baby touches something that has cold germs on it, then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, the germs can infect them. Diagnosis and Tests How is the common cold diagnosed? A healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. During the exam, the provider will check for signs, such as: Swelling in your nostrils. A stuffy nose. A red, irritated throat. Swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Clear lungs. What tests will be done to diagnose the common cold? Typically, a physical exam is enough to determine if you have a cold. You may need tests if the provider suspects you have COVID-19, the flu or another condition. The provider may give you a nasal swab test (cotton swab rubbed inside your nose) to check for these viruses. Chest X-rays can rule out other conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Management and Treatment How is the common cold treated? There’s no cure for a cold. You have to let it run its course. Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days and don’t turn into anything more serious. Common cold treatment includes over-the-counter (OTC) medications to help reduce your symptoms and keep you comfortable until you recover. Advertisement Why can’t antibiotics cure a cold? Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria. Because viruses cause colds, antibiotics don’t work for colds. Sometimes, children may develop complications from bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. Healthcare providers may prescribe antibiotics to treat these illnesses. What cold medicines relieve symptoms? There are many OTC common cold medication options available to treat your symptoms. But some of these medications aren’t safe for children. Check with a healthcare provider before giving your child OTC medications. Be careful not to combine medicines that treat multiple symptoms. You could get too much of some ingredients, which could cause other health problems, including organ damage. Medications that may relieve cold symptoms include: Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil®) may relieve headaches and fever. Decongestants: You can use medications like pseudoephedrine (Contac Cold 12 Hour® and Sudafed®). Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and other antihistamines may stop sneezing and a runny nose. Cough suppressants: Medications such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin® and Vicks DayQuil Cough®) and codeine can help reduce coughing. Providers don’t routinely recommend these for children under 5 years of age. Expectorants: Guaifenesin (Mucinex®) and other expectorants may help thin and loosen mucus. Advertisement How are common colds in babies treated? Unless prescribed by their provider, don’t give your baby any over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. To treat common cold in babies: Keep your baby comfortable. Give your baby fluids. For babies 6 months or younger, let them drink breast milk or formula. At 6 months, your baby can also have some water. Let your baby get plenty of rest. Since most children can’t blow their nose until about age 4, the following methods may help ease your baby’s stuffy nose: Saline and suction: About 15 minutes before a feeding, use over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops to loosen up the mucus in your baby’s nostrils. Suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb or oral suction device. This will clear the mucus out of your baby’s nose and allow them to breathe and suck at the same time. Petroleum jelly: Dab petroleum jelly on the outside of your baby’s nostrils to reduce irritation. Don’t block the inside of your baby’s nostrils. (Unless their provider recommends it, don’t use nasal sprays on your baby. They may work for a bit but will make their congestion worse with continued use.) Humidifier or vaporizer: Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier or vaporizer. The clean, cool mist will help moisten the air and decrease the drying of your baby’s nasal passages and throat. Clean and dry the humidifier thoroughly before using it to get rid of bacteria or mold that may have collected in the device. Ensure you have the appropriate filter, and check if it needs to be replaced. Don’t use hot water vaporizers because of the risk of burns. Steam: If you don’t have a humidifier, take your baby into a steamy room such as a bathroom. Turn on the hot water, close the door and sit together in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave your baby alone in the room. Be safe around water. Giving your baby a warm bath may also work. Babies can continue their normal activities if they seem well enough to do so. If they have a fever or complications, it’s best to keep them at home. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention Can the common cold be prevented? There are several steps you can take to prevent a cold, including: Washing your hands: Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, wiping your nose or coming into contact with someone who has a cold. Avoiding touching your face: Cold viruses spread from your hands to your eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning frequently used surfaces: Viruses can live on doorknobs and other places people often touch. Using hand sanitizers: When you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Strengthening your immune system: Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet and exercise so your body is ready to fight off germs. Staying home: To make sure you don’t spread the cold to others, stay home when you’re sick. How can colds in babies be prevented? The best way to prevent your baby from catching a cold is to keep them away from people who have colds. If possible, keep your baby home. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Hand washing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds: Adults who have contact with babies and young children should wash their hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping their nose. Wash your hands after touching someone who has a cold. After wiping your baby’s nose, wash your hands and your baby’s hands. Clean toys regularly and avoid sharing toys that babies place in their mouths. If soap and water aren’t available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or hand sanitizers. (Be sure to keep hand sanitizers away from children. They may be harmful if swallowed.) Keep your baby up-to-date on all of the recommended immunizations . They won’t stop colds, but they can help prevent some complications, such as bacterial infections of their ears or lungs. Pediatricians recommend the flu (influenza) vaccine each year for babies who are at least 6 months old. The shot protects against the flu but not against other respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 immunization is available as well for infants starting at 6 months of age. Outlook / Prognosis How long does a common cold last? Most colds go away on their own within seven to 10 days. Most people recover quickly and the common cold doesn’t lead to anything more serious. Can a cold kill you? The common cold isn’t fatal. In some people — especially those with weakened immune systems — a cold could lead to other conditions that could cause severe health problems. Those complications include: Asthma . Sinus infections . Ear infections . Living With What are the best common cold remedies? You may have heard that supplements and herbal remedies, such as zinc , vitamin C and echinacea can treat and prevent colds. Researchers haven’t found that any of those remedies can prevent colds. But zinc may shorten the illness and reduce symptoms. However, it may cause permanent loss of smell, especially when you use it in nasal sprays. The best common cold self-care remedy is to get plenty of rest. Consider taking time off from work or school for at least the first few days of illness. Not only will you have more time to rest, but you’ll avoid spreading germs to others. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids to keep your nose and throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeine because they have a drying effect. When should I see a healthcare provider for the common cold? Contact a healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms: High fever. Chest pain . Ear pain. Asthma flare-up or difficulty breathing. Symptoms lasting more than 10 days or getting worse. When should my baby see their provider for the common cold? Call your baby’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if your baby: Develops a high fever. Stops eating. Is vomiting. Has ear or stomach pain. Cries more than usual. Is sleepier than usual. Starts wheezing. Has trouble breathing. Additional Common Questions Does having a cold affect pregnancy? Having a cold during pregnancy isn’t usually dangerous. But you do need to be careful with what cold medications you take to treat symptoms. Your healthcare provider can let you know which ones are safe to use during pregnancy. If you think you may have the flu or you develop a fever, you should contact your provider right away. You may need immediate treatment. Why do colds occur in the winter? You can catch a cold any time of year, but it’s more likely during colder months. In winter, people stay indoors and are in closer contact with each other. A recent study in mice suggests cold temperatures may also affect your immune system’s response. Researchers found that when cooler air lowered nose temperature, mouse immune systems had a harder time stopping the rhinovirus from multiplying. The same may be true in humans. Common cold vs. Covid — what’s the difference? Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections. While rhinoviruses cause most types of common cold, coronaviruses do cause some. Most people recover quickly from these common colds. Coronaviruses may also travel into your lungs and lead to pneumonia and other complications that can be fatal. The novel (new) coronavirus discovered in 2019 causes a specific disease known as COVID-19. Early symptoms that make COVID-19 different from the common cold include: Fever . Chills and shaking. Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ). Loss of taste or smell ( anosmia ). Diarrhea . However, the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes slightly milder symptoms, making it easier to confuse with a cold. Omicron symptoms similar to the common cold include: Runny nose . Cough . Sore throat . Headache . Nasal congestion . Common cold vs. flu — what’s the difference? It can be hard to tell whether you have a cold or the flu since many of the symptoms are the same. Both are widespread during the colder months and affect your upper respiratory system. But different viruses cause cold and flu. The flu comes from the influenza virus, while many other types of viruses cause colds. The main difference between cold and flu is that you’re more likely to have a fever and chills with flu. Adults don’t usually get a fever with a common cold, although kids sometimes do. The flu also causes body aches and more severe symptoms than a cold. Although both the cold and flu can lead to complications, flu complications can be life-threatening. Common cold vs. chest cold — what’s the difference? A chest cold, or short-term (acute) bronchitis , causes irritation and a buildup of mucus in your lungs. Common colds turn into chest colds when the virus travels from your nose and throat to your lungs. Occasionally, bacteria cause chest colds. You can have a cough with a common cold or a chest cold. But chest colds produce a wet cough, meaning you may feel or cough up phlegm. You may also have: A cough that keeps you up all night. Shortness of breath. A sore chest. A note from Cleveland Clinic Although it may cause discomfort, the common cold is usually harmless. You can manage the symptoms of a cold with medications. Speed up your recovery by getting plenty of rest and fluids, and avoid being around others. If you don’t feel better in 10 days, see a healthcare provider.

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.\\nA cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by:\\nDroplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.\\nHand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.\\nSharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.\\nTouching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.\\nRisk factors These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:\\nAge. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.\\nWeakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.\\nTime of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.\\nSmoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.\\nExposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.\\nComplications These conditions can occur along with your cold:\\nMiddle ear infection. This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.\\nAsthma. A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.\\nSinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.\\nOther illnesses. A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.\\nMore Information Plugged ears: What is the remedy?\\nPrevention There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\\nClean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\\nCover your cough. Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.\\nDon't share. Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.\\nStay away from people with colds. Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.\\nReview your child care center's policies. Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.\\nTake care of yourself. Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nMay 24, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nAAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:\\nRunny nose or nasal congestion\\nCough\\nSneezing\\nSore throat\\nHeadache\\nMild body aches\\nFever (usually low grade in older children and adults)\\nComplications\\nComplications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:\\nMild to moderate:\\nMiddle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)\\nSinus infections\\nPotentially severe:\\nAsthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)\\nBronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)\\nBronchitis (infection of the large airways)\\nPneumonia (infection of the lungs)\\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)\\nSome respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness . This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.\\nCauses and spread\\nCauses\\nMore than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses , adenoviruses , enteroviruses (including EV-D68 ), and human metapneumovirus .\\nSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested , especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.\\nSpread\\nDifferent respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.\\nYou can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.\\nTip‎\\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others.

It is caused by more than 200 different viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds are highly contagious and can spread easily within households, schools, and workplaces. \\n\\n### Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and can include:\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Sneezing\\n- Sore or scratchy throat\\n- Cough\\n- Mild fatigue\\n- Low-grade fever (more common in children)\\n- Body aches\\n\\nThese symptoms can vary from mild to moderate and usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection. The mucus from the nose may change from clear to thick and yellow or green, which does not necessarily indicate a bacterial infection.\\n\\n### Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last about 7 to 10 days. Generally, adults experience two to three colds per year, while children may have more frequent infections. While there is no cure, symptoms can be managed with over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers and cough suppressants.\\n\\n### Treatment\\nTreatment options primarily focus on symptom relief, as colds typically resolve on their own:\\n- **Pain Relievers:** Such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen).\\n- **Decongestants:** Such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed).\\n- **Antihistamines:** For reducing sneezing and runny nose.\\n- **Cough Suppressants and Expectorants:** To help manage coughing.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viral infections like colds but may be prescribed if bacterial complications arise, such as bronchitis or sinus infections.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nWhile there is no vaccine for the common cold, certain preventative measures can help reduce infection rates:\\n- Frequent handwashing with soap and water.\\n- Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap is unavailable.\\n- Avoiding touching the face with unwashed hands.\\n- Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\\n- Staying away from individuals known to have colds.\\n\\n### Complications\\nThough most colds are harmless, some potential complications can include:\\n- Middle ear infections\\n- Sinusitis\\n- Exacerbation of asthma\\n- Pneumonia, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems.\\n\\n### When to Seek Medical Attention\\nAdults should seek care if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or do not improve.\\n- Fever exceeds 101.3°F (38.5°C) lasting more than 3 days.\\n- Severe headache or intense sore throat occurs.\\n\\nParents should have their children evaluated if:\\n- Infants have a fever over 100.4°F (38°C).\\n- Symptoms are severe or persistent.\\n\\nFor ongoing concerns or if symptoms worsen significantly, consulting a healthcare provider is recommended.\\n\\n### Additional Information\\nMore detailed information about the common cold can be found at health resources such as the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605), and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html).\\n\\n```\\n\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"```\\nThought: I now have gathered comprehensive information about the Common Cold from multiple reputable sources, including the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and CDC.\\nFinal Answer: \\n\\n### Common Cold Overview\\nThe common cold is a viral infection affecting the upper respiratory tract.

The mucus from the nose may change from clear to thick and yellow or green, which does not necessarily indicate a bacterial infection.\\n\\n### Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last about 7 to 10 days. Generally, adults experience two to three colds per year, while children may have more frequent infections. While there is no cure, symptoms can be managed with over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers and cough suppressants.\\n\\n### Treatment\\nTreatment options primarily focus on symptom relief, as colds typically resolve on their own:\\n- **Pain Relievers:** Such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen).\\n- **Decongestants:** Such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed).\\n- **Antihistamines:** For reducing sneezing and runny nose.\\n- **Cough Suppressants and Expectorants:** To help manage coughing.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viral infections like colds but may be prescribed if bacterial complications arise, such as bronchitis or sinus infections.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nWhile there is no vaccine for the common cold, certain preventative measures can help reduce infection rates:\\n- Frequent handwashing with soap and water.\\n- Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap is unavailable.\\n- Avoiding touching the face with unwashed hands.\\n- Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\\n- Staying away from individuals known to have colds.\\n\\n### Complications\\nThough most colds are harmless, some potential complications can include:\\n- Middle ear infections\\n- Sinusitis\\n- Exacerbation of asthma\\n- Pneumonia, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems.\\n\\n### When to Seek Medical Attention\\nAdults should seek care if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or do not improve.\\n- Fever exceeds 101.3°F (38.5°C) lasting more than 3 days.\\n- Severe headache or intense sore throat occurs.\\n\\nParents should have their children evaluated if:\\n- Infants have a fever over 100.4°F (38°C).\\n- Symptoms are severe or persistent.\\n\\nFor ongoing concerns or if symptoms worsen significantly, consulting a healthcare provider is recommended.\\n\\n### Additional Information\\nMore detailed information about the common cold can be found at health resources such as the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605), and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html).\\n\\n```\", \"tools\": [{\"name\": \"Search the internet with Serper\", \"description\": \"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

It is caused by more than 200 different viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most prevalent. Colds are highly contagious, spreading easily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching their face. The common cold accounts for significant absenteeism in schools and workplaces due to its high infection rate.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically manifest 1 to 3 days post-exposure to the virus, varying significantly in severity and duration. Key symptoms include:\\n- **Runny or Stuffy Nose:** Often the first symptom that presents.\\n- **Sneezing:** A reflex action triggered by irritation of the nasal passages.\\n- **Sore or Scratchy Throat:** Commonly experienced in the early stages.\\n- **Cough:** Can range from mild to severe, potentially causing discomfort.\\n- **Mild Fatigue:** General tiredness that may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Low-Grade Fever:** More common in children and may not occur in adults.\\n- **Body Aches:** Mild to moderate muscle aches are not uncommon.\\n\\nThese symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days and can last for about a week. The appearance of nasal mucus may change from clear to thick or discolored (yellow or green), but this does not necessarily indicate a bacterial infection.\\n\\n## Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last approximately 7 to 10 days. Adults usually contract two to three colds per year, while children may experience colds more frequently due to their developing immune systems. There is no definitive cure for the common cold; however, symptoms may be managed effectively with over-the-counter medications, allowing individuals to feel more comfortable while the virus runs its course.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreatment for the common cold primarily focuses on alleviating symptoms as the body recovers. Recommended treatments include:\\n- **Pain Relievers:** Medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) to reduce discomfort.\\n- **Decongestants:** Such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), which can relieve nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines:** Help reduce sneezing and a runny nose.\\n- **Cough Suppressants and Expectorants:** Such as dextromethorphan for cough relief and guaifenesin to loosen mucus.\\n\\nSince colds are caused by viruses, antibiotics are ineffective against them but might be prescribed if there are bacterial complications, such as bronchitis or sinus infections.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventative measures are crucial as there is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. Effective strategies include:\\n- **Frequent Handwashing:** Using soap and water, especially after public outings and before eating.\\n- **Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers:** Useful when soap is unavailable.\\n- **Avoid Touching the Face:** Particularly the eyes, nose, and mouth, with unwashed hands.\\n- **Regular Cleaning and Disinfecting:** Focus on frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs and phones.\\n- **Social Distancing:** Keeping away from those known to be infected with colds.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile most colds are benign, they can lead to complications in some individuals, which may include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections:** Inflammation and fluid build-up behind the eardrum, especially in children.\\n- **Sinusitis:** Inflammation of the sinus cavities, which can cause pain and pressure.\\n- **Exacerbation of Asthma:** Cold viruses can trigger asthma symptoms in susceptible individuals.\\n- **Pneumonia:** Particularly concerning for those with weakened immune systems or underlying health issues.\\n\\n## When to Seek Medical Attention\\nIt is essential to monitor symptoms carefully. Adults should seek medical attention if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or do not improve after several days.\\n- A fever exceeding 101.3°F (38.5°C) persists for more than 3 days.\\n- Severe headache or intense sore throat occurs.\\n\\nFor children, parents should consult a healthcare provider if:\\n- Infants exhibit a fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C).\\n- Symptoms are severe, persistent, or worsening substantially.\\n\\nTimely consultations can help avoid potential complications or misdiagnoses.\\n\\n## Additional Information\\nFor further resources and information on the common cold, visit:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n\\nThis report provides comprehensive insight into the common cold, its symptoms, treatment options, prevention strategies, and when to seek medical help, facilitating a better understanding of this frequent viral infection.\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Common Cold Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_2", "context": {"span_id": "0xb13d2baee81586cb", "trace_id": "0x2ac19a993e0c38a6cd2124eb510f793d"}, "parent_id": "0xb4bcf74ef49f085b", "start_time": 1742647956015957867, "end_time": 1742647983802169327, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"e9694372029f4d10b5f8467ea30c46b8\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"### Common Cold Overview\\nThe common cold is a viral infection affecting the upper respiratory tract.

It is caused by more than 200 different viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds are highly contagious and can spread easily within households, schools, and workplaces. The transmission occurs primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and also via direct contact with contaminated surfaces.\\n\\n### Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and can include:\\n- **Runny or Stuffy Nose:** Nasal congestion due to inflammation and increased mucus production.\\n- **Sneezing:** A reflex to clear nasal passages.\\n- **Sore or Scratchy Throat:** Often described as a \\\"dry\\\" throat due to postnasal drip.\\n- **Cough:** Can be dry or productive, depending on the extent of mucus in the airways.\\n- **Mild Fatigue:** General tiredness often accompanies other symptoms.\\n- **Low-Grade Fever:** More common in children than adults, this symptom usually does not exceed 101.3°F (38.5°C).\\n- **Body Aches:** General malaise and minor aches often accompany the infection.\\n\\nThese symptoms can vary from mild to moderate and usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection. The mucus from the nose may change from clear to thick and yellow or green, which does not necessarily indicate a bacterial infection.\\n\\n### Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last about 7 to 10 days. Generally, adults experience two to three colds per year, while children may have more frequent infections due to less developed immune systems. Recovery typically takes a week, but some symptoms, such as a cough, may linger for a few additional days. While there is no cure, symptoms can be managed with over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers and cough suppressants.\\n\\n### Treatment\\nTreatment options primarily focus on symptom relief, as colds typically resolve on their own:\\n- **Pain Relievers:** Such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) to alleviate pain and reduce fever.\\n- **Decongestants:** Such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) to relieve nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines:** These can help reduce sneezing and runny nose.\\n- **Cough Suppressants and Expectorants:** To help manage coughing; expectorants help to loosen mucus.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viral infections like colds but may be prescribed if bacterial complications arise, such as bronchitis or sinus infections. Self-care practices, such as rest, hydration, and warm soups, can also aid recovery.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nWhile there is no vaccine for the common cold, certain preventative measures can help reduce infection rates:\\n- **Frequent Handwashing:** Washing hands with soap and water, especially after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose, can help remove viruses.\\n- **Using Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer:** When soap is unavailable, this can effectively reduce germs.\\n- **Avoiding Touching the Face:** Minimizes the risk of virus transmission from hands to mucous membranes.\\n- **Cleaning and Disinfecting Frequently Touched Surfaces:** Reduces the likelihood of surface transmission.\\n- **Staying Away From Infected Individuals:** Limiting contact with those who have colds can help prevent catchings the virus.\\n\\n### Complications\\nThough most colds are harmless, some potential complications can include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections:** Common in children, these occur when fluid accumulates behind the eardrum due to Eustachian tube dysfunction.\\n- **Sinusitis:** Inflammation and swelling of the sinuses can develop when colds extend beyond a week.\\n- **Exacerbation of Asthma:** Colds can trigger wheezing and breathing difficulties in asthmatic individuals.\\n- **Pneumonia:** Although rare, pneumonia can occur, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems.\\n\\n### When to Seek Medical Attention\\nAdults should seek care if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or do not improve after a week.\\n- Fever exceeds 101.3°F (38.5°C) lasting more than 3 days.\\n- Severe headache or intense sore throat occurs, suggesting a more serious condition.\\n\\nParents should have their children evaluated if:\\n- Infants have a fever over 100.4°F (38°C).\\n- Symptoms are severe or persistent, indicating a need for further examination.\\n\\nFor ongoing concerns or if symptoms worsen significantly, consulting a healthcare provider is recommended to rule out more serious illnesses.\\n\\n### Additional Information\\nMore detailed information about the common cold can be found at health resources such as the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605), [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html), and [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/166606).\\n```\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"I have gathered more detailed information about the common cold, including symptoms, treatment, prevention, complications, and when to seek medical attention.

It is caused by more than 200 different viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common. Colds are highly contagious and can spread easily within households, schools, and workplaces. \\n\\n### Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and can include:\\n- Runny or stuffy nose\\n- Sneezing\\n- Sore or scratchy throat\\n- Cough\\n- Mild fatigue\\n- Low-grade fever (more common in children)\\n- Body aches\\n\\nThese symptoms can vary from mild to moderate and usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection. The mucus from the nose may change from clear to thick and yellow or green, which does not necessarily indicate a bacterial infection.\\n\\n### Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last about 7 to 10 days. Generally, adults experience two to three colds per year, while children may have more frequent infections. While there is no cure, symptoms can be managed with over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers and cough suppressants.\\n\\n### Treatment\\nTreatment options primarily focus on symptom relief, as colds typically resolve on their own:\\n- **Pain Relievers:** Such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen).\\n- **Decongestants:** Such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed).\\n- **Antihistamines:** For reducing sneezing and runny nose.\\n- **Cough Suppressants and Expectorants:** To help manage coughing.\\n\\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viral infections like colds but may be prescribed if bacterial complications arise, such as bronchitis or sinus infections.\\n\\n### Prevention\\nWhile there is no vaccine for the common cold, certain preventative measures can help reduce infection rates:\\n- Frequent handwashing with soap and water.\\n- Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap is unavailable.\\n- Avoiding touching the face with unwashed hands.\\n- Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\\n- Staying away from individuals known to have colds.\\n\\n### Complications\\nThough most colds are harmless, some potential complications can include:\\n- Middle ear infections\\n- Sinusitis\\n- Exacerbation of asthma\\n- Pneumonia, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems.\\n\\n### When to Seek Medical Attention\\nAdults should seek care if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or do not improve.\\n- Fever exceeds 101.3°F (38.5°C) lasting more than 3 days.\\n- Severe headache or intense sore throat occurs.\\n\\nParents should have their children evaluated if:\\n- Infants have a fever over 100.4°F (38°C).\\n- Symptoms are severe or persistent.\\n\\nFor ongoing concerns or if symptoms worsen significantly, consulting a healthcare provider is recommended.\\n\\n### Additional Information\\nMore detailed information about the common cold can be found at health resources such as the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605), and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html).\\n\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

Colds are highly contagious, spreading easily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching their face. The common cold accounts for significant absenteeism in schools and workplaces due to its high infection rate.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically manifest 1 to 3 days post-exposure to the virus, varying significantly in severity and duration. Key symptoms include:\\n- **Runny or Stuffy Nose:** Often the first symptom that presents.\\n- **Sneezing:** A reflex action triggered by irritation of the nasal passages.\\n- **Sore or Scratchy Throat:** Commonly experienced in the early stages.\\n- **Cough:** Can range from mild to severe, potentially causing discomfort.\\n- **Mild Fatigue:** General tiredness that may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Low-Grade Fever:** More common in children and may not occur in adults.\\n- **Body Aches:** Mild to moderate muscle aches are not uncommon.\\n\\nThese symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days and can last for about a week.

Adults usually contract two to three colds per year, while children may experience colds more frequently due to their developing immune systems. There is no definitive cure for the common cold; however, symptoms may be managed effectively with over-the-counter medications, allowing individuals to feel more comfortable while the virus runs its course.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreatment for the common cold primarily focuses on alleviating symptoms as the body recovers.

Effective strategies include:\\n- **Frequent Handwashing:** Using soap and water, especially after public outings and before eating.\\n- **Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers:** Useful when soap is unavailable.\\n- **Avoid Touching the Face:** Particularly the eyes, nose, and mouth, with unwashed hands.\\n- **Regular Cleaning and Disinfecting:** Focus on frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs and phones.\\n- **Social Distancing:** Keeping away from those known to be infected with colds.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile most colds are benign, they can lead to complications in some individuals, which may include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections:** Inflammation and fluid build-up behind the eardrum, especially in children.\\n- **Sinusitis:** Inflammation of the sinus cavities, which can cause pain and pressure.\\n- **Exacerbation of Asthma:** Cold viruses can trigger asthma symptoms in susceptible individuals.\\n- **Pneumonia:** Particularly concerning for those with weakened immune systems or underlying health issues.\\n\\n## When to Seek Medical Attention\\nIt is essential to monitor symptoms carefully.

It is caused by more than 200 different viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most prevalent. Colds are highly contagious, spreading easily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching their face. The common cold accounts for significant absenteeism in schools and workplaces due to its high infection rate.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically manifest 1 to 3 days post-exposure to the virus, varying significantly in severity and duration. Key symptoms include:\\n- **Runny or Stuffy Nose:** Often the first symptom that presents.\\n- **Sneezing:** A reflex action triggered by irritation of the nasal passages.\\n- **Sore or Scratchy Throat:** Commonly experienced in the early stages.\\n- **Cough:** Can range from mild to severe, potentially causing discomfort.\\n- **Mild Fatigue:** General tiredness that may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Low-Grade Fever:** More common in children and may not occur in adults.\\n- **Body Aches:** Mild to moderate muscle aches are not uncommon.\\n\\nThese symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days and can last for about a week. The appearance of nasal mucus may change from clear to thick or discolored (yellow or green), but this does not necessarily indicate a bacterial infection.\\n\\n## Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last approximately 7 to 10 days. Adults usually contract two to three colds per year, while children may experience colds more frequently due to their developing immune systems.

It is caused by more than 200 different viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most prevalent. Colds are highly contagious, spreading easily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching their face. The common cold accounts for significant absenteeism in schools and workplaces due to its high infection rate.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically manifest 1 to 3 days post-exposure to the virus, varying significantly in severity and duration. Key symptoms include:\\n- **Runny or Stuffy Nose:** Often the first symptom that presents.\\n- **Sneezing:** A reflex action triggered by irritation of the nasal passages.\\n- **Sore or Scratchy Throat:** Commonly experienced in the early stages.\\n- **Cough:** Can range from mild to severe, potentially causing discomfort.\\n- **Mild Fatigue:** General tiredness that may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Low-Grade Fever:** More common in children and may not occur in adults.\\n- **Body Aches:** Mild to moderate muscle aches are not uncommon.\\n\\nThese symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days and can last for about a week. The appearance of nasal mucus may change from clear to thick or discolored (yellow or green), but this does not necessarily indicate a bacterial infection.\\n\\n## Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last approximately 7 to 10 days. Adults usually contract two to three colds per year, while children may experience colds more frequently due to their developing immune systems. There is no definitive cure for the common cold; however, symptoms may be managed effectively with over-the-counter medications, allowing individuals to feel more comfortable while the virus runs its course.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreatment for the common cold primarily focuses on alleviating symptoms as the body recovers. Recommended treatments include:\\n- **Pain Relievers:** Medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) to reduce discomfort.\\n- **Decongestants:** Such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), which can relieve nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines:** Help reduce sneezing and a runny nose.\\n- **Cough Suppressants and Expectorants:** Such as dextromethorphan for cough relief and guaifenesin to loosen mucus.\\n\\nSince colds are caused by viruses, antibiotics are ineffective against them but might be prescribed if there are bacterial complications, such as bronchitis or sinus infections.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventative measures are crucial as there is no vaccine to protect against the common cold.

Adults should seek medical attention if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or do not improve after several days.\\n- A fever exceeding 101.3°F (38.5°C) persists for more than 3 days.\\n- Severe headache or intense sore throat occurs.\\n\\nFor children, parents should consult a healthcare provider if:\\n- Infants exhibit a fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C).\\n- Symptoms are severe, persistent, or worsening substantially.\\n\\nTimely consultations can help avoid potential complications or misdiagnoses.\\n\\n## Additional Information\\nFor further resources and information on the common cold, visit:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n\\nThis report provides comprehensive insight into the common cold, its symptoms, treatment options, prevention strategies, and when to seek medical help, facilitating a better understanding of this frequent viral infection.\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

Here are the main symptoms:\\n- **Runny or Stuffy Nose:** Often the first symptom you notice.\\n- **Sneezing:** A reflex action resulting from irritation in the nasal passages.\\n- **Sore or Scratchy Throat:** Commonly felt in the beginning stages of the illness.\\n- **Cough:** This can range from mild to severe and might cause discomfort.\\n- **Mild Fatigue:** Feeling generally tired may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Low-Grade Fever:** More common in children and might not happen in adults.\\n- **Body Aches:** You may experience mild to moderate muscle aches.\\n\\nThese symptoms usually reach their peak within 2 to 3 days and last about a week. Mucus might shift from clear to thick or discolored (yellow or green), but this doesn't always mean you have a bacterial infection.\\n\\n## Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last for about 7 to 10 days. Adults typically get two to three colds per year, while children can get colds more often due to their less developed immune systems. There isn't a cure for the common cold; however, symptoms can be effectively managed with over-the-counter medications, which help you feel more comfortable while your body fights off the virus.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreating the common cold focuses mainly on relieving symptoms while your body heals. Common treatment options include:\\n- **Pain Relievers:** Such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) to ease discomfort.\\n- **Decongestants:** Like pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) for clearing nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines:** To help reduce sneezing and running nose.\\n- **Cough Suppressants and Expectorants:** Such as dextromethorphan for cough relief and guaifenesin to loosen mucus.\\n\\nSince colds are caused by viruses, antibiotics don't work on them. However, doctors might prescribe antibiotics if complications arise, such as bronchitis or sinus infections.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nAs there is no vaccine for the common cold, taking steps to prevent infection is essential. Effective preventive measures include:\\n- **Frequent Handwashing:** Use soap and water, especially after being in public and before eating.\\n- **Using Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers:** Handy when soap is not available.\\n- **Avoid Touching the Face:** Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\\n- **Regular Cleaning and Disinfecting:** Pay attention to frequently touched surfaces like doorknobs and phones.\\n- **Social Distancing:** Stay away from people known to be sick with colds.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile most colds are harmless, they can lead to complications in some people. Potential complications include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections:** Fluid builds up behind the eardrum, especially in children.\\n- **Sinusitis:** Inflammation of the sinuses that can cause pain and pressure.\\n- **Worsening Asthma:** Colds can trigger asthma symptoms in those who have it.\\n- **Pneumonia:** A serious issue for those with weakened immune systems.\\n\\n## When to Seek Medical Attention\\nMonitoring your symptoms is vital. Adults should seek care if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few days.\\n- A fever over 101.3°F (38.5°C) lasts for more than 3 days.\\n- Severe headaches or intense sore throats develop.\\n\\nIf it’s a child, parents should consult a healthcare provider if:\\n- Infants show a fever of more than 100.4°F (38°C).\\n- Symptoms are severe, persistent, or getting worse.\\n\\nGetting medical attention can help prevent complications or misdiagnosis.\\n\\n## Additional Information\\nFor further information on the common cold, you can visit these resources:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n\\nThis report offers a comprehensive look at the common cold, outlining its symptoms, treatment options, prevention strategies, and when to seek medical help, enhancing understanding of this prevalent viral infection.\", \"text\": \"I now can give a great answer  \\nFinal Answer: \\n\\n# Common Cold Report\\n\\n## Overview\\nThe common cold is a viral infection that primarily affects the upper respiratory tract, mainly the nose and throat.

Colds are highly contagious, spreading easily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Individuals can also contract the virus by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching their face. The common cold accounts for significant absenteeism in schools and workplaces due to its high infection rate.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nCommon cold symptoms typically manifest 1 to 3 days post-exposure to the virus, varying significantly in severity and duration. Key symptoms include:\\n- **Runny or Stuffy Nose:** Often the first symptom that presents.\\n- **Sneezing:** A reflex action triggered by irritation of the nasal passages.\\n- **Sore or Scratchy Throat:** Commonly experienced in the early stages.\\n- **Cough:** Can range from mild to severe, potentially causing discomfort.\\n- **Mild Fatigue:** General tiredness that may accompany other symptoms.\\n- **Low-Grade Fever:** More common in children and may not occur in adults.\\n- **Body Aches:** Mild to moderate muscle aches are not uncommon.\\n\\nThese symptoms typically peak within 2 to 3 days and can last for about a week. The appearance of nasal mucus may change from clear to thick or discolored (yellow or green), but this does not necessarily indicate a bacterial infection.\\n\\n## Duration and Recovery\\nMost colds last approximately 7 to 10 days. Adults usually contract two to three colds per year, while children may experience colds more frequently due to their developing immune systems. There is no definitive cure for the common cold; however, symptoms may be managed effectively with over-the-counter medications, allowing individuals to feel more comfortable while the virus runs its course.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nTreatment for the common cold primarily focuses on alleviating symptoms as the body recovers. Recommended treatments include:\\n- **Pain Relievers:** Medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) to reduce discomfort.\\n- **Decongestants:** Such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), which can relieve nasal congestion.\\n- **Antihistamines:** Help reduce sneezing and a runny nose.\\n- **Cough Suppressants and Expectorants:** Such as dextromethorphan for cough relief and guaifenesin to loosen mucus.\\n\\nSince colds are caused by viruses, antibiotics are ineffective against them but might be prescribed if there are bacterial complications, such as bronchitis or sinus infections.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nPreventative measures are crucial as there is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. Effective strategies include:\\n- **Frequent Handwashing:** Using soap and water, especially after public outings and before eating.\\n- **Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers:** Useful when soap is unavailable.\\n- **Avoid Touching the Face:** Particularly the eyes, nose, and mouth, with unwashed hands.\\n- **Regular Cleaning and Disinfecting:** Focus on frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs and phones.\\n- **Social Distancing:** Keeping away from those known to be infected with colds.\\n\\n## Complications\\nWhile most colds are benign, they can lead to complications in some individuals, which may include:\\n- **Middle Ear Infections:** Inflammation and fluid build-up behind the eardrum, especially in children.\\n- **Sinusitis:** Inflammation of the sinus cavities, which can cause pain and pressure.\\n- **Exacerbation of Asthma:** Cold viruses can trigger asthma symptoms in susceptible individuals.\\n- **Pneumonia:** Particularly concerning for those with weakened immune systems or underlying health issues.\\n\\n## When to Seek Medical Attention\\nIt is essential to monitor symptoms carefully. Adults should seek medical attention if:\\n- Symptoms worsen or do not improve after several days.\\n- A fever exceeding 101.3°F (38.5°C) persists for more than 3 days.\\n- Severe headache or intense sore throat occurs.\\n\\nFor children, parents should consult a healthcare provider if:\\n- Infants exhibit a fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C).\\n- Symptoms are severe, persistent, or worsening substantially.\\n\\nTimely consultations can help avoid potential complications or misdiagnoses.\\n\\n## Additional Information\\nFor further resources and information on the common cold, visit:\\n- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold)\\n- [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605)\\n- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html)\\n\\nThis report provides comprehensive insight into the common cold, its symptoms, treatment options, prevention strategies, and when to seek medical help, facilitating a better understanding of this frequent viral infection.\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Common Cold Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}, {\"description\": \"Using the information received, write a report, translating very technical terms into more common language.

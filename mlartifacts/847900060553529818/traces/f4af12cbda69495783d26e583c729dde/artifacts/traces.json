Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic\\nSymptoms A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

At first, Lyme disease usually causes symptoms such as a rash , fever , headache , and fatigue . But if it is not treated early, the infection can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. Prompt treatment can help you recover quickly.\\nWhat causes Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is caused by bacteria. In the United States, this is usually a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi . It spreads to humans through the bite of an infected tick. The ticks that spread it are blacklegged ticks (or deer ticks). They are usually found in the:\\nNortheast\\nMid-Atlantic\\nUpper Midwest\\nPacific coast, especially northern California\\nThese ticks can attach to any part of your body. But they are often found in hard-to-see areas such as your groin, armpits, and scalp. Usually, the tick must be attached to you for more than 24 hours to spread the bacterium to you.\\nWho is more likely to get Lyme disease?\\nMost tick bites happen in the warmer months (April-September), when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can also get bitten during the rest of the year, especially if the temperatures are warmer than usual.\\nMost tick bites happen in the summer months when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can get bitten in the warmer months of early fall, or even late winter if temperatures are unusually high. And if there is a mild winter, ticks may come out earlier than usual.\\nWhat are the symptoms of Lyme disease?\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease start between 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bites you. The symptoms can include:\\nA red rash called erythema migrans (EM). Most people with Lyme disease get this rash. It gets bigger over several days and may feel warm. It is usually not painful or itchy. As it starts to get better, parts of it may fade. Sometimes this makes the rash look like a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\nFever\\nChills\\nHeadache\\nFatigue\\nMuscle and joint aches\\nSwollen lymph nodes (\\\"swollen glands\\\")\\nIf the infection is not treated, it can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. The symptoms may include:\\nSevere headaches and neck stiffness.\\nMore EM rashes on other areas of your body.\\nFacial palsy, which is a weakness in your facial muscles. It can cause drooping on one or both sides of your face.\\nArthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, especially in your knees and other large joints.\\nPain that comes and goes in your tendons, muscles, joints, and bones.\\nHeart palpitations, which are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast.\\nAn irregular heart beat (Lyme carditis).\\nEpisodes of dizziness or shortness of breath.\\nInflammation of the brain and spinal cord.\\nNerve pain.\\nShooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet.\\nHow is Lyme disease diagnosed?\\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider will consider:\\nYour symptoms\\nHow likely it is that you were exposed to infected blacklegged ticks\\nHow likely it is that you could have other illnesses that cause similar symptoms\\nThe results of any lab tests\\nMost Lyme disease tests check for antibodies made by the body in response to infection. These antibodies can take several weeks to develop. If you are tested right away, it may not show that you have Lyme disease, even if you have it. So you may need to have another test later.\\nWhat are the treatments for Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is treated with antibiotics . The earlier you are treated, the better; it gives you the best chance of fully recovering quickly.\\nAfter treatment, some patients may still have pain, fatigue, or difficulty thinking that lasts more than 6 months. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Researchers don't know why some people have PTLDS. There is no proven treatment for PTLDS; long-term antibiotics have not been shown to help. However, there are ways to help with the symptoms of PTLDS. If you have been treated for Lyme disease and still feel unwell, contact your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms. Most people do get better with time. But it can take several months before you feel better.\\nCan Lyme disease be prevented?\\nTo prevent Lyme disease, you should lower your risk of getting a tick bite:\\nAvoid areas where ticks live, such as grassy, brushy, or wooded areas. If you are hiking, walk in the center of the trail to avoid brush and grass.\\nUse an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent when you go outdoors. They are evaluated to make sure they are safe and effective. Make sure that the repellant has one of these ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. It is important to follow the instructions on the label.\\nTreat your clothing and gear with a repellant containing 0.5% permethrin\\nWear light-colored protective clothing, so you can easily see any ticks that get on you\\nWear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants. Also tuck your shirt into your pants and your pant legs into your socks.\\nCheck yourself, your children, and your pets daily for ticks. Carefully remove any ticks you find.\\nTake a shower and wash and dry your clothes at high temperatures after being outdoors\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\nStart Here\\nAbout Lyme Disease\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nLyme Disease\\n(American Academy of Family Physicians)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nLyme Disease\\n(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)\\nTicks and Lyme Disease: Symptoms, Treatment, and Prevention\\n(Food and Drug Administration)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nSymptoms\\nSigns and Symptoms of Untreated Lyme Disease\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nDiagnosis and Tests\\nLyme Disease Tests\\n(National Library of Medicine)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nPrevention and Risk Factors\\nHow Lyme Disease Spreads\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nPreventing Tick Bites\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nTick Removal: A Step-by-Step Guide (For Parents)\\n(Nemours Foundation)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nTravelers' Health: Mosquitoes, Ticks, and Other Arthropods\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nRelated Issues\\nNeurological Complications of Lyme Disease\\n(National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke)\\nSpecifics\\nChronic Lyme Disease\\n(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)\\nChronic Symptoms and Lyme Disease\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nGenetics\\nLyme disease: MedlinePlus Genetics\\n(National Library of Medicine)\\nImages\\nLyme Disease\\n(VisualDX)\\nStatistics and Research\\nLyme Disease Surveillance and Data\\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\\nClinical Trials\\nClinicalTrials.gov: Lyme Disease\\n(National Institutes of Health)\\nClinicalTrials.gov: Post-Lyme Disease Syndrome\\n(National Institutes of Health)\\nJournal Articles\\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\\nArticle: Estimation of medically-attended LB incidence in Norway, Finland and Poland using...\\nArticle: Of Lyme disease and machine learning in a One Health world.\\nArticle: Tick-borne encephalitis vaccination in persons with a recent history of Lyme...\\nLyme Disease -- see more articles\\nFind an Expert\\nAmerican Lyme Disease Foundation\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\nAlso in Spanish\\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\\nChildren\\nLyme Disease (For Kids)\\n(Nemours Foundation)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nLyme Disease (For Parents)\\n(Nemours Foundation)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nTeenagers\\nLyme Disease\\n(Nemours Foundation)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nLyme Disease\\n(VisualDX)\\nPatient Handouts\\nLyme disease\\n(Medical Encyclopedia)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nLyme disease blood test\\n(Medical Encyclopedia)\\nAlso in Spanish\\nTopic Image\\nMEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA\\nLyme disease\\nLyme disease - what to ask your doctor\\nLyme disease blood test\\nRelated Health Topics\\nTick Bites\\nNational Institutes of Health\\nThe primary NIH organization for research on\\n Lyme Disease is the\\n National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\\nOther Languages\\nFind health information in languages other than English on Lyme Disease\\nNIH MedlinePlus Magazine\\nOn the Front Lines Against Lyme Disease\\nDisclaimers\\nMedlinePlus links to health information from the National Institutes of Health and other federal government agencies.

Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.\\nTicks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.\\nYou're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.

This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\\nStage 1\\nLyme disease rash\\nEnlarge image\\nClose\\nLyme disease rash\\nLyme disease rash\\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nExtreme tiredness.\\nJoint stiffness.\\nMuscle aches and pains.\\nSwollen lymph nodes.\\nStage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\\nNeck pain or stiffness.\\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\\nStage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite.\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes.\\nIf you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible.\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.\\nLyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria. In North America, the black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, mainly carry the bacteria.\\nIn Europe, a different species of borrelia causes Lyme disease. Ticks carry the bacteria. These ticks are known by a few names, including castor bean tick, sheep tick or deer tick.\\nTick bites Ticks feed on blood by attaching to a host's skin. The tick feeds until it's swollen to many times its typical size. Deer ticks can feed on a host's blood for several days.\\nTicks pick up bacteria from a host, such as a deer or rodent. They don't get sick. But they can pass the bacteria to another host. When an infected tick feeds on a person, the bacteria can move to the person's bloodstream. The bacteria are less likely to spread Lyme disease if you remove the tick within 24 hours.\\nBoth young and adult ticks can carry the disease. Young ticks are tiny and hard to spot. You may not notice if a young tick bites you.\\nRisk factors Your risk for getting Lyme disease depends on if you spend time where they are likely to live. This includes the:\\nRegion. Deer ticks that carry Lyme disease are widespread. They are mostly found in the upper Midwest, the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, and in south central and southeastern Canada. The castor bean tick is found throughout Europe.\\nHabitat. Ticks live in wooded, shrubby or grassy areas.\\nTime of year. The risk of infection is greater in the spring, summer and fall. But ticks can be active any time the temperature is above freezing.\\nComplications Some people with Lyme disease report symptoms that continue after treatment. These longer-lasting symptoms may include:\\nArthritis that begins with Lyme disease and doesn't improve.\\nBody aches and pains.\\nConstant or frequent tiredness.\\nMemory complaints.\\nThese conditions are not clearly understood. Some people with these symptoms may be diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS. These long-lasting problems may be caused by:\\nIncomplete treatment.\\nReinfection with Lyme disease.\\nImmune system response to fragments of killed bacteria.\\nImmune system activity that harms healthy tissues, also called autoimmunity.\\nConditions other than Lyme disease that have not been diagnosed.\\nPrevention The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid tick bites when you are outdoors. Most ticks attach themselves to your lower legs and feet as you walk or work in grassy, wooded areas or overgrown fields. After a tick attaches to your body, it often crawls upward to find a spot to burrow into your skin.\\nIf you're in or plan to be in an area where ticks are likely to live, follow these tips to protect yourself.\\nUse tick repellents\\nSpray your outdoor clothing, shoes, tent and other camping gear with a repellent that has 0.5% permethrin. Some gear and clothing may be pre-treated with permethrin.\\nUse an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin, except your face. These include repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD) or 2-undecanone.\\nDo not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3.\\nDress for protection\\nWear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for you or others to see ticks on your clothing.\\nAvoid open-toed shoes or sandals.\\nWear long-sleeved shirts tucked into your pants.\\nWear long pants tucked into your socks.\\nCheck for ticks\\nShower as soon as possible to wash off any loose ticks. Check for ticks that may have burrowed.\\nUse a mirror to check your body well. Pay attention to your underarms, hair and hairline. Also check your ears, waist, and the area between your legs, behind your knees, and inside your bellybutton.\\nCheck your gear. Before you wash your outdoor clothes, put them in the dryer on hot for at least 10 minutes to kill ticks.\\nOther tips\\nDo a daily inspection for ticks on any pet that spends time outdoors.\\nStay on clear paths as much as possible in wooded and grassy areas.\\nMore Information Mayo Clinic Minute: Will there be a Lyme disease vaccine for humans?\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\nRequest an appointment\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\nFeb. 10, 2023\\nPrint\\nShow references\\nTickborne Diseases of the United States: A Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers. 6th ed.

At first, Lyme disease usually causes symptoms such as a rash , fever , headache , and fatigue . But if it is not treated early, the infection can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. Prompt treatment can help you recover quickly.\\nWhat causes Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is caused by bacteria. In the United States, this is usually a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi . It spreads to humans through the bite of an infected tick. The ticks that spread it are blacklegged ticks (or deer ticks). They are usually found in the:\\nNortheast\\nMid-Atlantic\\nUpper Midwest\\nPacific coast, especially northern California\\nThese ticks can attach to any part of your body. But they are often found in hard-to-see areas such as your groin, armpits, and scalp. Usually, the tick must be attached to you for more than 24 hours to spread the bacterium to you.\\nWho is more likely to get Lyme disease?\\nMost tick bites happen in the warmer months (April-September), when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can also get bitten during the rest of the year, especially if the temperatures are warmer than usual.\\nMost tick bites happen in the summer months when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can get bitten in the warmer months of early fall, or even late winter if temperatures are unusually high. And if there is a mild winter, ticks may come out earlier than usual.\\nWhat are the symptoms of Lyme disease?\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease start between 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bites you. The symptoms can include:\\nA red rash called erythema migrans (EM). Most people with Lyme disease get this rash. It gets bigger over several days and may feel warm. It is usually not painful or itchy. As it starts to get better, parts of it may fade. Sometimes this makes the rash look like a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\nFever\\nChills\\nHeadache\\nFatigue\\nMuscle and joint aches\\nSwollen lymph nodes (\\\"swollen glands\\\")\\nIf the infection is not treated, it can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. The symptoms may include:\\nSevere headaches and neck stiffness.\\nMore EM rashes on other areas of your body.\\nFacial palsy, which is a weakness in your facial muscles. It can cause drooping on one or both sides of your face.\\nArthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, especially in your knees and other large joints.\\nPain that comes and goes in your tendons, muscles, joints, and bones.\\nHeart palpitations, which are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast.\\nAn irregular heart beat (Lyme carditis).\\nEpisodes of dizziness or shortness of breath.\\nInflammation of the brain and spinal cord.\\nNerve pain.\\nShooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet.\\nHow is Lyme disease diagnosed?\\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider will consider:\\nYour symptoms\\nHow likely it is that you were exposed to infected blacklegged ticks\\nHow likely it is that you could have other illnesses that cause similar symptoms\\nThe results of any lab tests\\nMost Lyme disease tests check for antibodies made by the body in response to infection. These antibodies can take several weeks to develop. If you are tested right away, it may not show that you have Lyme disease, even if you have it. So you may need to have another test later.\\nWhat are the treatments for Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is treated with antibiotics . The earlier you are treated, the better; it gives you the best chance of fully recovering quickly.\\nAfter treatment, some patients may still have pain, fatigue, or difficulty thinking that lasts more than 6 months. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Researchers don't know why some people have PTLDS. There is no proven treatment for PTLDS; long-term antibiotics have not been shown to help. However, there are ways to help with the symptoms of PTLDS. If you have been treated for Lyme disease and still feel unwell, contact your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms. Most people do get better with time. But it can take several months before you feel better.\\nCan Lyme disease be prevented?\\nTo prevent Lyme disease, you should lower your risk of getting a tick bite:\\nAvoid areas where ticks live, such as grassy, brushy, or wooded areas. If you are hiking, walk in the center of the trail to avoid brush and grass.\\nUse an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent when you go outdoors. They are evaluated to make sure they are safe and effective. Make sure that the repellant has one of these ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol.

Commonly found in temperate regions, these ticks frequent wooded and grassy areas, especially in the **northeastern, upper Midwestern, and Pacific coastal regions** of the United States, as well as parts of **Europe and Canada**. \\n\\nThe disease is characterized by its variable symptoms which can range from mild to severe and affect multiple bodily systems. It is essential for individuals engaging in outdoor activities to be aware of Lyme disease due to the growing incidence of tick bites and infections.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can be categorized into three stages:\\n\\n### Early Localized Disease (3 to 30 days after tick bite)\\n- **Erythema migrans**: A hallmark of early Lyme disease, this rash often resembles a \\\"bull's-eye\\\" and can expand gradually.\\n- **Fever**: Patients may experience mild to moderate fever as part of the immune response.\\n- **Headache**: Typical of many infections, headaches in Lyme disease can vary in intensity.\\n- **Fatigue**: Patients frequently report unexplained tiredness, which can be debilitating.\\n- **Muscle and Joint Aches**: Musculoskeletal discomfort is common.\\n- **Swollen Lymph Nodes**: Indicates an immune response to the infection.\\n\\n### Early Disseminated Disease (3 to 10 weeks after tick bite)\\n- **Multiple EM Rashes**: More than one \\\"bull's-eye\\\" rash can develop.\\n- **Neck Stiffness**: This symptom may signify central nervous system involvement.\\n- **Muscular Weakness**: Particularly observed as facial droop.\\n- **Lyme Carditis**: A serious condition that may cause irregular heartbeats, requiring urgent medical attention.\\n- **Pain or Numbness in Extremities**: Neurological symptoms may begin to manifest.\\n- **Possible Vision Issues**: Including blurred vision or other visual disturbances.\\n\\n### Late Disseminated Disease (2 to 12 months after tick bite)\\n- **Arthritis**: Particularly affects the knees and can be severe and painful.\\n- **Additional Neurological Problems**: Chronic neurological issues may arise, including cognitive impairments, sleep disorders, or peripheral neuropathy.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease involves a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory testing. Healthcare providers typically consider:\\n- **Symptoms**: The clinical presentation, particularly the characteristic rash.\\n- **Tick Exposure History**: Recent outdoor activities in areas known for Lyme disease.\\n- **Laboratory Tests**: Serological tests to check for antibodies take weeks post-infection to become evident, complicating diagnosis in early stages.\\n\\nCommonly used tests include:\\n- **Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)**: The first test done; if positive, a Western blot test is often performed for confirmation.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nLyme disease treatments primarily involve **antibiotics**, which can effectively eradicate the infection, particularly when administered early. The standard courses generally last from 10 to 21 days, depending on the clinical manifestation. Antibiotics commonly used include:\\n- **Doxycycline**: Effective for most Lyme disease patients.\\n- **Amoxicillin** or **Cefuroxime axetil**: Alternatives for those who cannot take doxycycline.\\n\\nSome patients may develop **post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS)**, characterized by fatigue, pain, and cognitive issues lasting longer than six months despite appropriate antibiotic treatment. Management of PTLDS focuses on symptom relief, as no specific treatments are currently proven effective.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo effectively prevent Lyme disease, individuals should take several protective measures:\\n- **Avoid High-Risk Areas**: Steer clear of densely wooded or grassy regions where ticks thrive.\\n- **Use Insect Repellents**: EPA-registered repellents containing DEET or permethrin are effective.\\n- **Wear Protective Clothing**: Long sleeves, pants, and closed shoes can reduce skin exposure.\\n- **Perform Tick Checks**: Thoroughly check your body and clothing for ticks after being outdoors; pay attention to hidden areas.\\n- **Shower After Outdoor Activities**: Prompt cleaning can help remove ticks before they attach.\\n\\n## Resources for Further Information\\n- **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**: Provides extensive resources and guidelines regarding Lyme disease.\\n- **Mayo Clinic**: Offers detailed information about symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options.\\n- **MedlinePlus**: A resource for general health information related to Lyme disease.\\n\\nEducation and awareness about Lyme disease are essential for prevention and effective management, ensuring that those at risk can take necessary precautions and seek timely care.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Lyme Disease Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_2", "context": {"span_id": "0x7d5c59aa15fc7b92", "trace_id": "0x59259b4862b9961f37882bdb0a16c9c3"}, "parent_id": "0x6ff08e216d23a7af", "start_time": 1742647700889972022, "end_time": 1742647717595264596, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"f4af12cbda69495783d26e583c729dde\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"**Lyme Disease Overview**\\nLyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by the Borrelia bacteria spread to humans through the bite of an infected blacklegged (deer) tick.

Commonly found in temperate regions, these ticks frequent wooded and grassy areas, especially in the **northeastern, upper Midwestern, and Pacific coastal regions** of the United States, as well as parts of **Europe and Canada**. \\n\\nThe disease is characterized by its variable symptoms which can range from mild to severe and affect multiple bodily systems. It is essential for individuals engaging in outdoor activities to be aware of Lyme disease due to the growing incidence of tick bites and infections.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can be categorized into three stages:\\n\\n### Early Localized Disease (3 to 30 days after tick bite)\\n- **Erythema migrans**: A hallmark of early Lyme disease, this rash often resembles a \\\"bull's-eye\\\" and can expand gradually.\\n- **Fever**: Patients may experience mild to moderate fever as part of the immune response.\\n- **Headache**: Typical of many infections, headaches in Lyme disease can vary in intensity.\\n- **Fatigue**: Patients frequently report unexplained tiredness, which can be debilitating.\\n- **Muscle and Joint Aches**: Musculoskeletal discomfort is common.\\n- **Swollen Lymph Nodes**: Indicates an immune response to the infection.\\n\\n### Early Disseminated Disease (3 to 10 weeks after tick bite)\\n- **Multiple EM Rashes**: More than one \\\"bull's-eye\\\" rash can develop.\\n- **Neck Stiffness**: This symptom may signify central nervous system involvement.\\n- **Muscular Weakness**: Particularly observed as facial droop.\\n- **Lyme Carditis**: A serious condition that may cause irregular heartbeats, requiring urgent medical attention.\\n- **Pain or Numbness in Extremities**: Neurological symptoms may begin to manifest.\\n- **Possible Vision Issues**: Including blurred vision or other visual disturbances.\\n\\n### Late Disseminated Disease (2 to 12 months after tick bite)\\n- **Arthritis**: Particularly affects the knees and can be severe and painful.\\n- **Additional Neurological Problems**: Chronic neurological issues may arise, including cognitive impairments, sleep disorders, or peripheral neuropathy.\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease involves a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory testing. Healthcare providers typically consider:\\n- **Symptoms**: The clinical presentation, particularly the characteristic rash.\\n- **Tick Exposure History**: Recent outdoor activities in areas known for Lyme disease.\\n- **Laboratory Tests**: Serological tests to check for antibodies take weeks post-infection to become evident, complicating diagnosis in early stages.\\n\\nCommonly used tests include:\\n- **Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)**: The first test done; if positive, a Western blot test is often performed for confirmation.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nLyme disease treatments primarily involve **antibiotics**, which can effectively eradicate the infection, particularly when administered early. The standard courses generally last from 10 to 21 days, depending on the clinical manifestation. Antibiotics commonly used include:\\n- **Doxycycline**: Effective for most Lyme disease patients.\\n- **Amoxicillin** or **Cefuroxime axetil**: Alternatives for those who cannot take doxycycline.\\n\\nSome patients may develop **post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS)**, characterized by fatigue, pain, and cognitive issues lasting longer than six months despite appropriate antibiotic treatment. Management of PTLDS focuses on symptom relief, as no specific treatments are currently proven effective.\\n\\n## Prevention\\nTo effectively prevent Lyme disease, individuals should take several protective measures:\\n- **Avoid High-Risk Areas**: Steer clear of densely wooded or grassy regions where ticks thrive.\\n- **Use Insect Repellents**: EPA-registered repellents containing DEET or permethrin are effective.\\n- **Wear Protective Clothing**: Long sleeves, pants, and closed shoes can reduce skin exposure.\\n- **Perform Tick Checks**: Thoroughly check your body and clothing for ticks after being outdoors; pay attention to hidden areas.\\n- **Shower After Outdoor Activities**: Prompt cleaning can help remove ticks before they attach.\\n\\n## Resources for Further Information\\n- **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**: Provides extensive resources and guidelines regarding Lyme disease.\\n- **Mayo Clinic**: Offers detailed information about symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options.\\n- **MedlinePlus**: A resource for general health information related to Lyme disease.\\n\\nEducation and awareness about Lyme disease are essential for prevention and effective management, ensuring that those at risk can take necessary precautions and seek timely care.\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_6", "context": {"span_id": "0xc31dd7e5ba58e388", "trace_id": "0x59259b4862b9961f37882bdb0a16c9c3"}, "parent_id": "0x7d5c59aa15fc7b92", "start_time": 1742647700897874737, "end_time": 1742647702520298327, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"f4af12cbda69495783d26e583c729dde\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Lyme Disease Senior Analyst\\n.

Common areas where these ticks are found include the northeastern, upper Midwestern, and Pacific coastal regions of the United States. It is also prevalent in parts of Europe and Canada.\\n\\n**Symptoms**\\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease can vary and typically occur in stages:\\n\\n1. **Early Localized Disease (3 to 30 days after tick bite)**\\n   - Erythema migrans rash: a red rash that spreads, often resembling a \\\"bull's-eye.\\\"\\n   - Fever\\n   - Headache\\n   - Fatigue\\n   - Muscle and joint aches\\n   - Swollen lymph nodes\\n\\n2. **Early Disseminated Disease (3 to 10 weeks after tick bite)**\\n   - Multiple EM rashes\\n   - Neck stiffness\\n   - Muscular weakness (e.g., facial droop)\\n   - Lyme carditis (irregular heartbeat)\\n   - Pain or numbness in extremities\\n   - Possible vision issues\\n\\n3. **Late Disseminated Disease (2 to 12 months after tick bite)**\\n   - Arthritis, particularly in knees\\n   - Additional neurological problems\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\\nDiagnosing Lyme disease involves evaluating the patient’s symptoms, tick exposure history, and lab test results. Serological tests that check for antibodies are commonly used but may take weeks post-infection to become detectable.\\n\\n**Treatment**\\nLyme disease is usually treated with antibiotics. Early treatment yields the best outcomes. Some patients may experience lasting symptoms known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) despite appropriate treatment. There are no proven treatments for PTLDS, but symptom management strategies can help.\\n\\n**Prevention**\\nProtective measures to prevent Lyme disease include:\\n- Avoiding areas where ticks thrive (wooded and grassy regions).\\n- Using EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET or permethrin.\\n- Wearing protective clothing to reduce skin exposure.\\n- Performing thorough tick checks after outdoor activities.\\n- Showering and washing clothing post-exposure.\\n\\n**Resources for Further Information**\\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Lyme disease\\n- Mayo Clinic for symptoms and treatment guidance\\n- MedlinePlus for general health information\\n\\nThis comprehensive content reflects the critical aspects of Lyme Disease, its symptoms, risk factors, treatment options, and prevention techniques backed by reputable sources including the CDC, Mayo Clinic, and MedlinePlus.\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

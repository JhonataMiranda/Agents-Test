What is Influenza (Flu)?\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza viruses. It primarily affects the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. The severity of symptoms can vary greatly, ranging from mild to severe. Common symptoms include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Body aches\\n- Headaches\\n- Chills\\n- Fatigue\\n\\nIn children, symptoms may also include:\\n- Fussiness or irritability\\n- Ear pain\\n- Gastrointestinal issues such as vomiting\\n\\nThe flu can lead to serious health complications, particularly among high-risk groups.\\n\\n## 2. Causes\\nInfluenza is caused by different strains of the influenza virus, predominantly Influenza A and B, which are associated with seasonal outbreaks. Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, as well as by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that approximately 40 million flu-related illnesses occurred in the U.S. during the 2023-2024 flu season, emphasizing the widespread impact of the virus.\\n\\n## 3. Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms typically manifest suddenly and usually include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Body aches\\n- Fatigue\\n- Diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\nThe illness typically lasts about one to two weeks, with severity varying based on the individual, age, and underlying health conditions.\\n\\n## 4. Transmission\\nThe flu virus is contagious, with transmission occurring approximately one day before symptoms appear and persisting for up to seven days after a person becomes ill. Young children and those with weakened immune systems may spread the virus for an even longer duration, complicating prevention efforts.\\n\\n## 5. Diagnosis\\nMedical professionals typically diagnose the flu based on reported symptoms. Confirmatory tests, such as a rapid influenza diagnostic test involving nasal swab, may be conducted. Early diagnosis is essential for managing and mitigating the impact of the flu.\\n\\n## 6. Treatment\\nMost individuals recover from the influenza virus without the need for antiviral medication. However, antiviral drugs like Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Baloxavir can help reduce the severity of the illness if administered promptly after symptom onset. Home care strategies recommended include:\\n- Rest\\n- Staying hydrated\\n- Using over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to alleviate symptoms.\\n\\n## 7. Prevention\\nAnnual vaccinations are the primary and most effective means of preventing the flu. Different vaccines are available depending on age and health status. Alongside vaccination, good hygiene practices are essential, including:\\n- Regular handwashing\\n- Wearing masks in crowded settings\\n- Avoiding close contact with sick individuals\\n\\n## 8.

It impacts the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. Symptoms range from mild to severe and can include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills, and fatigue. In children, symptoms may present as fussiness or irritability and can include ear pain or gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting.\\n\\n2. **Causes:**\\n   - The flu is caused by various strains of the influenza virus, primarily Influenza A and B, which are responsible for seasonal outbreaks. The viruses spread through respiratory droplets when a sick person coughs or sneezes and can also be transmitted by touching contaminated surfaces.\\n\\n3. **Symptoms:**\\n   - Flu symptoms typically appear suddenly and can last for about one to two weeks. Common symptoms include:\\n     - Fever\\n     - Cough\\n     - Sore throat\\n     - Body aches\\n     - Fatigue\\n     - Diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\n4. **Transmission:**\\n   - The flu is contagious and can be transmitted from one day before symptoms appear until up to seven days after becoming sick. Young children and individuals with weakened immune systems may also spread the virus longer.\\n\\n5. **Diagnosis:**\\n   - Doctors typically diagnose the flu based on symptoms and may perform tests to confirm, like a rapid influenza diagnostic test that includes taking a nasal swab.\\n\\n6. **Treatment:**\\n   - Most people recover without needing antiviral medications. However, antiviral drugs such as Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Baloxavir can help lessen the severity of the illness if taken soon after symptoms appear.\\n   - Home care includes rest, hydration, and medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to manage symptoms.\\n\\n7. **Prevention:**\\n   - Annual vaccinations are the most effective way to prevent the flu. There are different vaccines suitable for different age groups and health conditions. Other preventive measures include practicing good hygiene like handwashing, wearing masks in crowded places, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying away from sick individuals.\\n\\n8. **Complications:**\\n   - While many healthy individuals recover from the flu without issue, it can lead to severe complications, especially in high-risk groups such as young children, the elderly, pregnant individuals, and those with chronic health conditions.\\n\\n9. **Seasonality:**\\n   - Flu season in the U.S. typically occurs in the fall and winter, peaking between December and February.\\n\\n10. **Education Resources:**\\n   - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Mayo Clinic provide extensive resources for understanding, preventing, and treating the flu.\\n\\nThese insights provide a robust understanding of Influenza (Flu), highlighting its symptoms, causes, prevention methods, and treatment options.\\n```\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Influenza (Flu) Senior Data Researcher\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_1", "context": {"span_id": "0x4a82728e60b4d4f1", "trace_id": "0x4fdd1ad9bfe368e71f382ee949327919"}, "parent_id": "0xbcbfc8bba5fea8ad", "start_time": 1742647683023411305, "end_time": 1742647699126983361, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"8952994be2c94eec869bfc9f5aa617e8\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"\", \"tools\": [{\"name\": \"Search the internet with Serper\", \"description\": \"Tool Name: Search the internet with Serper\\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.\\nIn some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.\\nRelated information\\nCOVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences - Related information COVID-19 vs. flu: Similarities and differences COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences? - Related information COVID-19, cold, allergies and the flu: What are the differences?\\nWhen to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.\\nIf you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.\\nIf you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:\\nTrouble breathing or shortness of breath.\\nChest pain or pressure.\\nOngoing dizziness.\\nHard to wake up or confusion.\\nDehydration.\\nSeizures.\\nWorsening of existing medical conditions.\\nSevere weakness or muscle pain.\\nEmergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:\\nFast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.\\nGray or blue lips or nail beds.\\nNo tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.\\nSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.\\nMore Information Flu: When to see a doctor?\\nRequest an appointment\\nThere is a problem with\\n information submitted for this request.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

Flu season — when cases of the flu go up dramatically — in the Northern Hemisphere (which includes the U.S.) is October through May. The highest number of cases (peak) usually happen between December and February. How common is the flu? The flu is one of the most common infectious diseases . Every flu season, about 20 to 40 million people in the U.S. catch the flu. What is the difference between the flu and the common cold? The flu and the common cold can have similar symptoms, like runny nose and cough. But cold symptoms are usually mild and flu symptoms can be severe and lead to serious complications. Different viruses cause colds and the flu. How do I know if I have the flu or COVID-19? Since they have similar symptoms, the only way to know for sure if you have the flu or COVID-19 is to get tested. They both have a risk of serious illness. But different viruses cause these infections, and providers treat them with different medications. Who is at higher risk for complications from the flu? Certain health conditions can put you at higher risk for severe illness from the flu. This includes life-threatening complications that require hospitalization. You’re at higher risk for serious illness if you: Have asthma , COPD or another chronic lung disease. Have a history of kidney, liver, neurological, heart or blood vessels disease, including stroke . Have a condition that causes issues with muscle function or makes it difficult to cough, swallow or clear fluids from your airways. Have diabetes . Have a weakened immune system (from HIV/AIDS , cancer or immunosuppressive medications ). Have a blood disorder, like sickle cell disease . Have a BMI greater than 30 (have obesity). Are under 5 years old or over 65 years old. Are pregnant. Are under 19 years old and take aspirin regularly. Live in a long-term care facility. Advertisement Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic American Indians, Alaska Native people and Hispanic or Latino people have the highest rates of severe illness from the flu compared to non-Hispanic White people and non-Hispanic Asian people. Symptoms and Causes With so many symptoms in common, it can be hard to tell the difference between a cold and the flu. Here’s how to tell which is which. What are the symptoms of the flu? Symptoms of the flu usually come on quickly, and can include: Fever . Chills . Body aches. Cough . Headache . Sore throat . Runny or stuffy nose ( congestion ). Tiredness or feeling run down. Diarrhea or vomiting (usually only in kids). You may not have all of these symptoms. What causes the flu? The influenza virus causes flu. Influenza A, B and C are the most common types that infect people. Influenza A and B are seasonal (most people get them in the winter) and have more severe symptoms. Influenza C doesn’t cause severe symptoms and it’s not seasonal — the number of cases stays about the same throughout the year. H1N1 (“swine flu”) and bird flu are both subtypes of influenza A. Is the flu contagious? Yes, the flu is contagious (it spreads from person to person). For every person infected, they spread the flu to one to two more people. How does the flu spread? The influenza virus spreads from direct or indirect contact with someone else who’s infected. Common ways to get the flu include: From someone nearby coughing, sneezing or talking. Droplets can either get onto your hands or move through the air to get into your nose or mouth. The flu then moves into your lungs. By touching a surface that’s contaminated by the flu virus, then touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. This includes things like door knobs, desks, computers and phones. By touching the hands or face of someone who has the flu, then touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. How long after exposure will I get the flu? If infected, you’ll usually get symptoms of the flu one to four days after exposure (incubation period). Diagnosis and Tests How is the flu diagnosed? Your provider diagnoses the flu by listening to your symptoms and testing a sample of mucus from your nose. They’ll put a long stick with a soft tip (swab) in your nose to test for influenza . Results may take a few minutes or your provider may send the sample to a lab, where you’ll get results in a day or two. Management and Treatment How is the flu treated? Providers can treat the flu with antiviral medications under certain circumstances. Antivirals can reduce your risk of severe illness and shorten the amount of time you’re sick. Many people can treat the flu without prescription medications. Providers prescribe antivirals if you: Have had symptoms for under 48 hours. Antivirals are less likely to work if you start them after two days of symptoms. The virus has already made more copies of itself and your body has started to fight it off with its own antibodies . Have an underlying condition or are at risk for severe illness. Providers may prescribe antivirals even if you’ve had symptoms for longer than 48 hours. Have severe symptoms, even if you’ve been sick for longer than 48 hours. Live with or care for people who are at risk for severe complications of the flu. Advertisement What medications treat the flu? Antiviral drugs for influenza include: Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®). You take oseltamivir by mouth as a pill or a liquid. You usually take it for several days. Zanamivir (Relenza®). You breathe zanamivir in through your mouth with an inhaler . You usually have to take it for several days. Zanamivir isn’t recommended for people with breathing issues, like asthma or COPD. Peramivir (Rapivap®). Your provider gives you peramivir directly into your veins using an IV. You usually only need one dose of peramivir. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). You take baloxavir marboxil by mouth as a pill or a liquid. You only take one dose. Baloxavir isn’t recommended if you’re pregnant, breastfeeding, hospitalized or have certain medical conditions. Tell your provider about any health conditions you have before starting an antiviral medication. Side effects of treatment Each antiviral medication has different side effects, but common ones include nausea and diarrhea. Inhaled medications can cause spasms that tighten and narrow your airways ( bronchospasm ). How do I manage symptoms of the flu? Many people can manage the symptoms of flu at home with over-the-counter (OTC) medications and other therapies, including: Getting plenty of rest. Drinking fluids like water or broth to help prevent dehydration. Applying heat packs or hot water bottles can help with aching muscles. Taking acetaminophen (Tylenol®) or NSAIDs (Advil®, Motrin®, Aleve®) can help lower your fever and relieve head and body aches. Using spray or oral decongestants like phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine can help with a runny or stuffy nose. Taking cough suppressants (antitussives) like dextromethorphan can help calm a nagging cough. Using expectorants like guaifenesin make it easier to clear mucus out of your lungs. Advertisement Not everyone should take certain OTCs, so check with your provider before you use them. It’s also a good idea to make sure certain medications are okay to use together or with supplements. Don’t give aspirin to children under the age of 16 unless their provider says it’s okay. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention How can I prevent the flu? The best way to reduce your risk is to get the flu vaccine yearly. You can get it as a shot or a mist sprayed into your nose. The influenza virus can change (mutate) over time, so you need to get vaccinated every year. Other ways to reduce your risk of getting the flu include: Wash your hands often with soap and water. If you can’t use soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough. Cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue rather than your bare hand. Avoid being around other people when you or they are sick with the flu or other infectious diseases. Consider wearing a mask if you’re sick and can’t avoid being around others. Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose and mouth. Don’t share food or eating utensils (forks, spoons, cups) with others. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have the flu? Most people are able to manage flu symptoms at home and recover within a few days to a week. Because it can cause severe illness, it’s important to keep an eye on your symptoms and get medical attention if you need it. This is especially important if you have an underlying health condition. Advertisement If you’re sick with the flu, you should avoid being around others, except to seek medical care. How long does the flu last? Flu can last from a few days to two weeks. Symptoms like fever and body aches can come on suddenly but usually go away faster than other symptoms. A cough or runny nose can last longer. How long is the flu contagious? You can be contagious with the flu from a day before your symptoms start to up to a week after. You’re most contagious for three to four days after your symptoms start. People with weakened immune systems and infants may be contagious for longer. When can I go back to work/school? To avoid spreading the flu to others, you shouldn’t go back to work or school until it’s been at least 24 hours since you’ve had a fever (without taking fever-reducing medications). Your employer or school may have different requirements for returning. Complications The flu virus itself can cause complications or it can weaken your immune system and allow bacteria to infect different parts of your body (secondary infection). Complications and secondary infections include: Ear infections . Sinus infections . Severe lung infection ( pneumonia ). Pneumonia can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening conditions. Pregnancy loss (miscarriage) . Neural tube defects (NTDs) in the developing fetus of a pregnant woman. How many people die from the flu each year? In a typical flu season in the U.S., it’s estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 people die from the flu. Another 300,000 to 500,000 require hospitalization for serious illness. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? If you think you have the flu, it’s important to get tested early on so that antiviral medications are most effective if your provider prescribes them. Contact a healthcare provider right away if: You have flu symptoms and an underlying condition that puts you at higher risk for severe illness. Your symptoms don’t start to improve after seven to 10 days or if you have a fever lasting longer than three days. You’re pregnant and have a fever or other flu symptoms. When should I go to ER? Go to the ER or seek immediate medical attention if you have symptoms of severe illness, including: High fever (over 103 F/40 C). Difficulty breathing. Not peeing or peeing very little. Pain in your chest or stomach (abdomen) that doesn’t go away. Persistent dizziness. Confusion. Severe muscle pain or weakness. Seizures . Bluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis, which can be a sign of low oxygen levels in your blood or tissues ). Fever or cough that gets better or goes away but then get worse. Worsening of other health conditions. What questions should I ask my doctor? How do I take my medication? What over-the-counter medications can I use? How do I treat my symptoms at home? What severe symptoms should I look out for? When should I go to the ER? When should I follow up with you? How long might it take to feel better? Additional Common Questions Is the stomach flu influenza? No, gastroenteritis, commonly called “stomach flu,” isn’t caused by the influenza virus. It’s not related to the seasonal flu. A note from Cleveland Clinic While the flu is very common, it’s also important to remember that it can lead to life-threatening complications. Getting your flu shot is the best way to avoid getting sick and protect your loved ones and neighbors, too. If you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant, talk to your provider about reducing your risk of flu. Having the flu isn’t fun for anyone, but most people can get through with some movies and chicken soup at home.

The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \\\"stomach flu\\\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.\\nAside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.\\nAre you fully protected?\\nCreate your personalized vaccination plan.\\nCreate my plan\\nProducts & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home Remedies\\nSymptoms The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.\\nSymptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.\\nOther common flu symptoms include:\\nFever.\\nCough.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches.\\nFeeling very tired.\\nSweating and chills.\\nIn children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable.

These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\\nIt's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.\\nInfluenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.\\nA person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\\nRisk factors There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.\\nOlder and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.\\nLiving conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.\\nWeakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.\\nChronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.\\nRace or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.\\nAspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.\\nPregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.\\nObesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\\nComplications If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.\\nBut people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.\\nGetting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.\\nOther complications may be:\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nMuscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.\\nToxic shock syndrome.\\nWorsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.\\nPrevention\\nFlu vaccines at Mayo Clinic\\nMayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.\\nLearn more about how to get your flu shot at Mayo Clinic.\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.\\nGetting a flu vaccine lowers:\\nThe risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.\\nThe risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.\\nThe risk of dying of the flu.\\nThe 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.\\nThe vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.\\nFor older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.\\nIf you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.\\nThe nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:\\nPeople who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.\\nPregnant people.\\nYoung people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.\\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.\\nChildren between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.\\nPeople who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.\\nPeople with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.\\nCheck with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.\\nThere also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.\\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.\\nThe first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.\\nAlso, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.\\nControlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:\\nWash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.\\nAvoid touching your face. Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.\\nCover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.\\nClean surfaces. Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.\\nAvoid crowds. The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.\\nAlso avoid anyone who is sick.\\nIf you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. More Information Flu shots Cold and flu viruses: How long can they live outside the body?

The flu and COVID-19 can be severe, but colds rarely are. What is the flu (influenza)? The flu is an illness you get from the influenza virus. It causes symptoms like head and body aches, sore throat, fever and respiratory symptoms, which can be severe. Flu is most common in winter months, when many people can get sick at once (an epidemic). Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy When is flu season? Flu season — when cases of the flu go up dramatically — in the Northern Hemisphere (which includes the U.S.) is October through May. The highest number of cases (peak) usually happen between December and February. How common is the flu? The flu is one of the most common infectious diseases . Every flu season, about 20 to 40 million people in the U.S. catch the flu. What is the difference between the flu and the common cold? The flu and the common cold can have similar symptoms, like runny nose and cough. But cold symptoms are usually mild and flu symptoms can be severe and lead to serious complications. Different viruses cause colds and the flu. How do I know if I have the flu or COVID-19? Since they have similar symptoms, the only way to know for sure if you have the flu or COVID-19 is to get tested. They both have a risk of serious illness. But different viruses cause these infections, and providers treat them with different medications. Who is at higher risk for complications from the flu? Certain health conditions can put you at higher risk for severe illness from the flu. This includes life-threatening complications that require hospitalization. You’re at higher risk for serious illness if you: Have asthma , COPD or another chronic lung disease. Have a history of kidney, liver, neurological, heart or blood vessels disease, including stroke . Have a condition that causes issues with muscle function or makes it difficult to cough, swallow or clear fluids from your airways. Have diabetes . Have a weakened immune system (from HIV/AIDS , cancer or immunosuppressive medications ). Have a blood disorder, like sickle cell disease . Have a BMI greater than 30 (have obesity). Are under 5 years old or over 65 years old. Are pregnant. Are under 19 years old and take aspirin regularly. Live in a long-term care facility. Advertisement Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic American Indians, Alaska Native people and Hispanic or Latino people have the highest rates of severe illness from the flu compared to non-Hispanic White people and non-Hispanic Asian people. Symptoms and Causes With so many symptoms in common, it can be hard to tell the difference between a cold and the flu. Here’s how to tell which is which. What are the symptoms of the flu? Symptoms of the flu usually come on quickly, and can include: Fever . Chills . Body aches. Cough . Headache . Sore throat . Runny or stuffy nose ( congestion ). Tiredness or feeling run down. Diarrhea or vomiting (usually only in kids). You may not have all of these symptoms. What causes the flu? The influenza virus causes flu. Influenza A, B and C are the most common types that infect people. Influenza A and B are seasonal (most people get them in the winter) and have more severe symptoms. Influenza C doesn’t cause severe symptoms and it’s not seasonal — the number of cases stays about the same throughout the year. H1N1 (“swine flu”) and bird flu are both subtypes of influenza A. Is the flu contagious? Yes, the flu is contagious (it spreads from person to person). For every person infected, they spread the flu to one to two more people. How does the flu spread? The influenza virus spreads from direct or indirect contact with someone else who’s infected. Common ways to get the flu include: From someone nearby coughing, sneezing or talking. Droplets can either get onto your hands or move through the air to get into your nose or mouth. The flu then moves into your lungs. By touching a surface that’s contaminated by the flu virus, then touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. This includes things like door knobs, desks, computers and phones. By touching the hands or face of someone who has the flu, then touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. How long after exposure will I get the flu? If infected, you’ll usually get symptoms of the flu one to four days after exposure (incubation period). Diagnosis and Tests How is the flu diagnosed? Your provider diagnoses the flu by listening to your symptoms and testing a sample of mucus from your nose. They’ll put a long stick with a soft tip (swab) in your nose to test for influenza . Results may take a few minutes or your provider may send the sample to a lab, where you’ll get results in a day or two. Management and Treatment How is the flu treated? Providers can treat the flu with antiviral medications under certain circumstances. Antivirals can reduce your risk of severe illness and shorten the amount of time you’re sick. Many people can treat the flu without prescription medications. Providers prescribe antivirals if you: Have had symptoms for under 48 hours. Antivirals are less likely to work if you start them after two days of symptoms. The virus has already made more copies of itself and your body has started to fight it off with its own antibodies . Have an underlying condition or are at risk for severe illness. Providers may prescribe antivirals even if you’ve had symptoms for longer than 48 hours. Have severe symptoms, even if you’ve been sick for longer than 48 hours. Live with or care for people who are at risk for severe complications of the flu. Advertisement What medications treat the flu? Antiviral drugs for influenza include: Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®). You take oseltamivir by mouth as a pill or a liquid. You usually take it for several days. Zanamivir (Relenza®). You breathe zanamivir in through your mouth with an inhaler . You usually have to take it for several days. Zanamivir isn’t recommended for people with breathing issues, like asthma or COPD. Peramivir (Rapivap®). Your provider gives you peramivir directly into your veins using an IV. You usually only need one dose of peramivir. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). You take baloxavir marboxil by mouth as a pill or a liquid. You only take one dose. Baloxavir isn’t recommended if you’re pregnant, breastfeeding, hospitalized or have certain medical conditions. Tell your provider about any health conditions you have before starting an antiviral medication. Side effects of treatment Each antiviral medication has different side effects, but common ones include nausea and diarrhea. Inhaled medications can cause spasms that tighten and narrow your airways ( bronchospasm ). How do I manage symptoms of the flu? Many people can manage the symptoms of flu at home with over-the-counter (OTC) medications and other therapies, including: Getting plenty of rest. Drinking fluids like water or broth to help prevent dehydration. Applying heat packs or hot water bottles can help with aching muscles. Taking acetaminophen (Tylenol®) or NSAIDs (Advil®, Motrin®, Aleve®) can help lower your fever and relieve head and body aches. Using spray or oral decongestants like phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine can help with a runny or stuffy nose. Taking cough suppressants (antitussives) like dextromethorphan can help calm a nagging cough. Using expectorants like guaifenesin make it easier to clear mucus out of your lungs. Advertisement Not everyone should take certain OTCs, so check with your provider before you use them. It’s also a good idea to make sure certain medications are okay to use together or with supplements. Don’t give aspirin to children under the age of 16 unless their provider says it’s okay. Care at Cleveland Clinic Find a Primary Care Provider Schedule an Appointment Prevention How can I prevent the flu? The best way to reduce your risk is to get the flu vaccine yearly. You can get it as a shot or a mist sprayed into your nose. The influenza virus can change (mutate) over time, so you need to get vaccinated every year. Other ways to reduce your risk of getting the flu include: Wash your hands often with soap and water. If you can’t use soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough. Cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue rather than your bare hand. Avoid being around other people when you or they are sick with the flu or other infectious diseases. Consider wearing a mask if you’re sick and can’t avoid being around others. Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose and mouth. Don’t share food or eating utensils (forks, spoons, cups) with others. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have the flu? Most people are able to manage flu symptoms at home and recover within a few days to a week. Because it can cause severe illness, it’s important to keep an eye on your symptoms and get medical attention if you need it. This is especially important if you have an underlying health condition. Advertisement If you’re sick with the flu, you should avoid being around others, except to seek medical care. How long does the flu last? Flu can last from a few days to two weeks. Symptoms like fever and body aches can come on suddenly but usually go away faster than other symptoms. A cough or runny nose can last longer. How long is the flu contagious? You can be contagious with the flu from a day before your symptoms start to up to a week after. You’re most contagious for three to four days after your symptoms start. People with weakened immune systems and infants may be contagious for longer. When can I go back to work/school? To avoid spreading the flu to others, you shouldn’t go back to work or school until it’s been at least 24 hours since you’ve had a fever (without taking fever-reducing medications). Your employer or school may have different requirements for returning. Complications The flu virus itself can cause complications or it can weaken your immune system and allow bacteria to infect different parts of your body (secondary infection). Complications and secondary infections include: Ear infections . Sinus infections . Severe lung infection ( pneumonia ). Pneumonia can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening conditions. Pregnancy loss (miscarriage) . Neural tube defects (NTDs) in the developing fetus of a pregnant woman. How many people die from the flu each year? In a typical flu season in the U.S., it’s estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 people die from the flu. Another 300,000 to 500,000 require hospitalization for serious illness. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? If you think you have the flu, it’s important to get tested early on so that antiviral medications are most effective if your provider prescribes them. Contact a healthcare provider right away if: You have flu symptoms and an underlying condition that puts you at higher risk for severe illness. Your symptoms don’t start to improve after seven to 10 days or if you have a fever lasting longer than three days. You’re pregnant and have a fever or other flu symptoms. When should I go to ER? Go to the ER or seek immediate medical attention if you have symptoms of severe illness, including: High fever (over 103 F/40 C). Difficulty breathing. Not peeing or peeing very little. Pain in your chest or stomach (abdomen) that doesn’t go away. Persistent dizziness. Confusion. Severe muscle pain or weakness. Seizures . Bluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis, which can be a sign of low oxygen levels in your blood or tissues ). Fever or cough that gets better or goes away but then get worse. Worsening of other health conditions. What questions should I ask my doctor? How do I take my medication? What over-the-counter medications can I use? How do I treat my symptoms at home? What severe symptoms should I look out for? When should I go to the ER? When should I follow up with you? How long might it take to feel better? Additional Common Questions Is the stomach flu influenza? No, gastroenteritis, commonly called “stomach flu,” isn’t caused by the influenza virus. It’s not related to the seasonal flu. A note from Cleveland Clinic While the flu is very common, it’s also important to remember that it can lead to life-threatening complications. Getting your flu shot is the best way to avoid getting sick and protect your loved ones and neighbors, too. If you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant, talk to your provider about reducing your risk of flu. Having the flu isn’t fun for anyone, but most people can get through with some movies and chicken soup at home.

It impacts the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. Symptoms range from mild to severe and can include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills, and fatigue. In children, symptoms may present as fussiness or irritability and can include ear pain or gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting.\\n\\n2. **Causes:**\\n   - The flu is caused by various strains of the influenza virus, primarily Influenza A and B, which are responsible for seasonal outbreaks. The viruses spread through respiratory droplets when a sick person coughs or sneezes and can also be transmitted by touching contaminated surfaces.\\n\\n3. **Symptoms:**\\n   - Flu symptoms typically appear suddenly and can last for about one to two weeks. Common symptoms include:\\n     - Fever\\n     - Cough\\n     - Sore throat\\n     - Body aches\\n     - Fatigue\\n     - Diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\n4. **Transmission:**\\n   - The flu is contagious and can be transmitted from one day before symptoms appear until up to seven days after becoming sick. Young children and individuals with weakened immune systems may also spread the virus longer.\\n\\n5. **Diagnosis:**\\n   - Doctors typically diagnose the flu based on symptoms and may perform tests to confirm, like a rapid influenza diagnostic test that includes taking a nasal swab.\\n\\n6. **Treatment:**\\n   - Most people recover without needing antiviral medications. However, antiviral drugs such as Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Baloxavir can help lessen the severity of the illness if taken soon after symptoms appear.\\n   - Home care includes rest, hydration, and medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to manage symptoms.\\n\\n7. **Prevention:**\\n   - Annual vaccinations are the most effective way to prevent the flu. There are different vaccines suitable for different age groups and health conditions. Other preventive measures include practicing good hygiene like handwashing, wearing masks in crowded places, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying away from sick individuals.\\n\\n8. **Complications:**\\n   - While many healthy individuals recover from the flu without issue, it can lead to severe complications, especially in high-risk groups such as young children, the elderly, pregnant individuals, and those with chronic health conditions.\\n\\n9. **Seasonality:**\\n   - Flu season in the U.S. typically occurs in the fall and winter, peaking between December and February.\\n\\n10. **Education Resources:**\\n   - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Mayo Clinic provide extensive resources for understanding, preventing, and treating the flu.\\n\\nThese insights provide a robust understanding of Influenza (Flu), highlighting its symptoms, causes, prevention methods, and treatment options.\\n```\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"```\\nThought: I have now gathered substantial information on Influenza (Flu) from multiple trusted sources, which will provide a thorough overview of the topic.\\nFinal Answer: \\n**Comprehensive Overview of Influenza (Flu)**\\n\\n1. **What is Influenza (Flu)?**\\n   - Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses.

What is Influenza (Flu)?\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza viruses. It primarily affects the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. The severity of symptoms can vary greatly, ranging from mild to severe. Common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, and in children, additional symptoms like irritability or gastrointestinal issues, such as vomiting. The flu can lead to serious health complications, particularly among high-risk groups.\\n\\n## 2. Causes\\nInfluenza is caused by different strains of the influenza virus, predominantly Influenza A and B, which are associated with seasonal outbreaks. Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, as well as by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. According to estimates from the CDC, approximately 40 million flu-related illnesses occurred in the U.S. during the 2023-2024 flu season, underscoring the wide reach of the virus.\\n\\n## 3. Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms typically manifest suddenly and usually include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Body aches\\n- Fatigue\\n- Diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\nThe illness typically lasts about one to two weeks, with severity varying based on the individual, age, and underlying health conditions.\\n\\n## 4. Transmission\\nThe flu virus is contagious, with transmission occurring about one day before symptoms appear and persisting for up to seven days after a person becomes ill. Young children and those with weakened immune systems may be capable of spreading the virus for an even longer duration, which can complicate prevention efforts.\\n\\n## 5. Diagnosis\\nMedical professionals typically diagnose the flu based on reported symptoms. Confirmatory tests may be conducted, such as a rapid influenza diagnostic test involving a nasal swab. Early diagnosis is essential for managing and mitigating the impact of the flu.\\n\\n## 6. Treatment\\nMost individuals recover from the influenza virus without the need for antiviral medication. However, antiviral drugs like Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Baloxavir can help reduce the severity if administered promptly after symptom onset. Home care strategies are recommended, including rest, hydration, and using over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to alleviate symptoms.\\n\\n## 7. Prevention\\nAnnual vaccinations are the primary and most effective means of preventing the flu. Different vaccines are available depending on age and health status. Alongside vaccination, good hygiene practices—such as regular handwashing, wearing masks in crowded settings, and refraining from close contact with sick individuals—play crucial roles in prevention efforts.\\n\\n## 8. Complications\\nWhile many healthy individuals recover from the flu without complications, it can lead to severe health issues, particularly for vulnerable populations, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic health conditions. During the 2023-2024 flu season, an estimated 28,000 deaths were attributed to influenza in the U.S.\\n\\n## 9. Seasonality\\nFlu season typically unfolds in fall and winter, peaking between December and February. The impact of the flu during these seasons can vary significantly from year to year based on influenza virus strain circulation and public health measures taken.\\n\\n## 10. Education Resources\\nExtensive resources for understanding, preventing, and treating the flu are provided by organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Mayo Clinic. These resources include guidance on vaccination, hygiene practices, and recognizing flu symptoms to encourage timely treatment.\\n\\nThese insights illustrate the key aspects of Influenza (Flu), emphasizing its symptoms, causes, prevention methods, treatment options, and the ongoing impact on public health. As highlighted by the significant burden of disease in the U.S. during the 2023-2024 flu season, effective strategies for prevention and education remain paramount.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"Influenza (Flu) Senior Analyst\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Agent.execute_task_2", "context": {"span_id": "0xae1062af0f5c63fc", "trace_id": "0x4fdd1ad9bfe368e71f382ee949327919"}, "parent_id": "0x088b8c170954c6ab", "start_time": 1742647699142810122, "end_time": 1742647719129793451, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"8952994be2c94eec869bfc9f5aa617e8\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"context\": \"**Comprehensive Overview of Influenza (Flu)**\\n\\n1. **What is Influenza (Flu)?**\\n   - Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses.

What is Influenza (Flu)?\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza viruses. It primarily affects the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. The severity of symptoms can vary greatly, ranging from mild to severe. Common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, and in children, additional symptoms like irritability or gastrointestinal issues, such as vomiting. The flu can lead to serious health complications, particularly among high-risk groups.\\n\\n## 2. Causes\\nInfluenza is caused by different strains of the influenza virus, predominantly Influenza A and B, which are associated with seasonal outbreaks. Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, as well as by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. According to estimates from the CDC, approximately 40 million flu-related illnesses occurred in the U.S. during the 2023-2024 flu season, underscoring the wide reach of the virus.\\n\\n## 3. Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms typically manifest suddenly and usually include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Body aches\\n- Fatigue\\n- Diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\nThe illness typically lasts about one to two weeks, with severity varying based on the individual, age, and underlying health conditions.\\n\\n## 4. Transmission\\nThe flu virus is contagious, with transmission occurring about one day before symptoms appear and persisting for up to seven days after a person becomes ill. Young children and those with weakened immune systems may be capable of spreading the virus for an even longer duration, which can complicate prevention efforts.\\n\\n## 5. Diagnosis\\nMedical professionals typically diagnose the flu based on reported symptoms. Confirmatory tests may be conducted, such as a rapid influenza diagnostic test involving a nasal swab. Early diagnosis is essential for managing and mitigating the impact of the flu.\\n\\n## 6. Treatment\\nMost individuals recover from the influenza virus without the need for antiviral medication. However, antiviral drugs like Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Baloxavir can help reduce the severity if administered promptly after symptom onset. Home care strategies are recommended, including rest, hydration, and using over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to alleviate symptoms.\\n\\n## 7. Prevention\\nAnnual vaccinations are the primary and most effective means of preventing the flu. Different vaccines are available depending on age and health status. Alongside vaccination, good hygiene practices—such as regular handwashing, wearing masks in crowded settings, and refraining from close contact with sick individuals—play crucial roles in prevention efforts.\\n\\n## 8. Complications\\nWhile many healthy individuals recover from the flu without complications, it can lead to severe health issues, particularly for vulnerable populations, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic health conditions. During the 2023-2024 flu season, an estimated 28,000 deaths were attributed to influenza in the U.S.\\n\\n## 9. Seasonality\\nFlu season typically unfolds in fall and winter, peaking between December and February. The impact of the flu during these seasons can vary significantly from year to year based on influenza virus strain circulation and public health measures taken.\\n\\n## 10. Education Resources\\nExtensive resources for understanding, preventing, and treating the flu are provided by organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Mayo Clinic. These resources include guidance on vaccination, hygiene practices, and recognizing flu symptoms to encourage timely treatment.\\n\\nThese insights illustrate the key aspects of Influenza (Flu), emphasizing its symptoms, causes, prevention methods, treatment options, and the ongoing impact on public health. As highlighted by the significant burden of disease in the U.S. during the 2023-2024 flu season, effective strategies for prevention and education remain paramount.\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "LLM.call_6", "context": {"span_id": "0x52462c0674209230", "trace_id": "0x4fdd1ad9bfe368e71f382ee949327919"}, "parent_id": "0xae1062af0f5c63fc", "start_time": 1742647699150405137, "end_time": 1742647700676958983, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"8952994be2c94eec869bfc9f5aa617e8\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Influenza (Flu) Senior Analyst\\n.

It impacts the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. Symptoms range from mild to severe and can include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills, and fatigue. In children, symptoms may present as fussiness or irritability and can include ear pain or gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting.\\n\\n2. **Causes:**\\n   - The flu is caused by various strains of the influenza virus, primarily Influenza A and B, which are responsible for seasonal outbreaks. The viruses spread through respiratory droplets when a sick person coughs or sneezes and can also be transmitted by touching contaminated surfaces.\\n\\n3. **Symptoms:**\\n   - Flu symptoms typically appear suddenly and can last for about one to two weeks. Common symptoms include:\\n     - Fever\\n     - Cough\\n     - Sore throat\\n     - Body aches\\n     - Fatigue\\n     - Diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\n4. **Transmission:**\\n   - The flu is contagious and can be transmitted from one day before symptoms appear until up to seven days after becoming sick. Young children and individuals with weakened immune systems may also spread the virus longer.\\n\\n5. **Diagnosis:**\\n   - Doctors typically diagnose the flu based on symptoms and may perform tests to confirm, like a rapid influenza diagnostic test that includes taking a nasal swab.\\n\\n6. **Treatment:**\\n   - Most people recover without needing antiviral medications. However, antiviral drugs such as Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Baloxavir can help lessen the severity of the illness if taken soon after symptoms appear.\\n   - Home care includes rest, hydration, and medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to manage symptoms.\\n\\n7. **Prevention:**\\n   - Annual vaccinations are the most effective way to prevent the flu. There are different vaccines suitable for different age groups and health conditions. Other preventive measures include practicing good hygiene like handwashing, wearing masks in crowded places, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying away from sick individuals.\\n\\n8. **Complications:**\\n   - While many healthy individuals recover from the flu without issue, it can lead to severe complications, especially in high-risk groups such as young children, the elderly, pregnant individuals, and those with chronic health conditions.\\n\\n9. **Seasonality:**\\n   - Flu season in the U.S. typically occurs in the fall and winter, peaking between December and February.\\n\\n10. **Education Resources:**\\n   - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Mayo Clinic provide extensive resources for understanding, preventing, and treating the flu.\\n\\nThese insights provide a robust understanding of Influenza (Flu), highlighting its symptoms, causes, prevention methods, and treatment options.\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

It impacts the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. Symptoms range from mild to severe and can include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills, and fatigue. In children, symptoms may present as fussiness or irritability and can include ear pain or gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting.\\n\\n2. **Causes:**\\n   - The flu is caused by various strains of the influenza virus, primarily Influenza A and B, which are responsible for seasonal outbreaks. The viruses spread through respiratory droplets when a sick person coughs or sneezes and can also be transmitted by touching contaminated surfaces.\\n\\n3. **Symptoms:**\\n   - Flu symptoms typically appear suddenly and can last for about one to two weeks. Common symptoms include:\\n     - Fever\\n     - Cough\\n     - Sore throat\\n     - Body aches\\n     - Fatigue\\n     - Diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\n4. **Transmission:**\\n   - The flu is contagious and can be transmitted from one day before symptoms appear until up to seven days after becoming sick. Young children and individuals with weakened immune systems may also spread the virus longer.\\n\\n5. **Diagnosis:**\\n   - Doctors typically diagnose the flu based on symptoms and may perform tests to confirm, like a rapid influenza diagnostic test that includes taking a nasal swab.\\n\\n6. **Treatment:**\\n   - Most people recover without needing antiviral medications. However, antiviral drugs such as Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Baloxavir can help lessen the severity of the illness if taken soon after symptoms appear.\\n   - Home care includes rest, hydration, and medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to manage symptoms.\\n\\n7. **Prevention:**\\n   - Annual vaccinations are the most effective way to prevent the flu. There are different vaccines suitable for different age groups and health conditions. Other preventive measures include practicing good hygiene like handwashing, wearing masks in crowded places, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying away from sick individuals.\\n\\n8. **Complications:**\\n   - While many healthy individuals recover from the flu without issue, it can lead to severe complications, especially in high-risk groups such as young children, the elderly, pregnant individuals, and those with chronic health conditions.\\n\\n9. **Seasonality:**\\n   - Flu season in the U.S. typically occurs in the fall and winter, peaking between December and February.\\n\\n10. **Education Resources:**\\n   - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Mayo Clinic provide extensive resources for understanding, preventing, and treating the flu.\\n\\nThese insights provide a robust understanding of Influenza (Flu), highlighting its symptoms, causes, prevention methods, and treatment options.\\n```\\n\\nBegin!

What is Influenza (Flu)?\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza viruses. It primarily affects the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. The severity of symptoms can vary greatly, ranging from mild to severe. Common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, and in children, additional symptoms like irritability or gastrointestinal issues, such as vomiting. The flu can lead to serious health complications, particularly among high-risk groups.\\n\\n## 2. Causes\\nInfluenza is caused by different strains of the influenza virus, predominantly Influenza A and B, which are associated with seasonal outbreaks. Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, as well as by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. According to estimates from the CDC, approximately 40 million flu-related illnesses occurred in the U.S. during the 2023-2024 flu season, underscoring the wide reach of the virus.\\n\\n## 3. Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms typically manifest suddenly and usually include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Body aches\\n- Fatigue\\n- Diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\nThe illness typically lasts about one to two weeks, with severity varying based on the individual, age, and underlying health conditions.\\n\\n## 4. Transmission\\nThe flu virus is contagious, with transmission occurring about one day before symptoms appear and persisting for up to seven days after a person becomes ill. Young children and those with weakened immune systems may be capable of spreading the virus for an even longer duration, which can complicate prevention efforts.\\n\\n## 5. Diagnosis\\nMedical professionals typically diagnose the flu based on reported symptoms. Confirmatory tests may be conducted, such as a rapid influenza diagnostic test involving a nasal swab. Early diagnosis is essential for managing and mitigating the impact of the flu.\\n\\n## 6. Treatment\\nMost individuals recover from the influenza virus without the need for antiviral medication. However, antiviral drugs like Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Baloxavir can help reduce the severity if administered promptly after symptom onset. Home care strategies are recommended, including rest, hydration, and using over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to alleviate symptoms.\\n\\n## 7. Prevention\\nAnnual vaccinations are the primary and most effective means of preventing the flu. Different vaccines are available depending on age and health status. Alongside vaccination, good hygiene practices—such as regular handwashing, wearing masks in crowded settings, and refraining from close contact with sick individuals—play crucial roles in prevention efforts.\\n\\n## 8. Complications\\nWhile many healthy individuals recover from the flu without complications, it can lead to severe health issues, particularly for vulnerable populations, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic health conditions. During the 2023-2024 flu season, an estimated 28,000 deaths were attributed to influenza in the U.S.\\n\\n## 9. Seasonality\\nFlu season typically unfolds in fall and winter, peaking between December and February. The impact of the flu during these seasons can vary significantly from year to year based on influenza virus strain circulation and public health measures taken.\\n\\n## 10. Education Resources\\nExtensive resources for understanding, preventing, and treating the flu are provided by organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Mayo Clinic. These resources include guidance on vaccination, hygiene practices, and recognizing flu symptoms to encourage timely treatment.\\n\\nThese insights illustrate the key aspects of Influenza (Flu), emphasizing its symptoms, causes, prevention methods, treatment options, and the ongoing impact on public health.

What is Influenza (Flu)?\\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza viruses. It primarily affects the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. The severity of symptoms can vary greatly, ranging from mild to severe. Common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, and in children, additional symptoms like irritability or gastrointestinal issues, such as vomiting. The flu can lead to serious health complications, particularly among high-risk groups.\\n\\n## 2. Causes\\nInfluenza is caused by different strains of the influenza virus, predominantly Influenza A and B, which are associated with seasonal outbreaks. Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, as well as by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. According to estimates from the CDC, approximately 40 million flu-related illnesses occurred in the U.S. during the 2023-2024 flu season, underscoring the wide reach of the virus.\\n\\n## 3. Symptoms\\nFlu symptoms typically manifest suddenly and usually include:\\n- Fever\\n- Cough\\n- Sore throat\\n- Body aches\\n- Fatigue\\n- Diarrhea (more common in children)\\n\\nThe illness typically lasts about one to two weeks, with severity varying based on the individual, age, and underlying health conditions.\\n\\n## 4. Transmission\\nThe flu virus is contagious, with transmission occurring about one day before symptoms appear and persisting for up to seven days after a person becomes ill. Young children and those with weakened immune systems may be capable of spreading the virus for an even longer duration, which can complicate prevention efforts.\\n\\n## 5. Diagnosis\\nMedical professionals typically diagnose the flu based on reported symptoms. Confirmatory tests may be conducted, such as a rapid influenza diagnostic test involving a nasal swab. Early diagnosis is essential for managing and mitigating the impact of the flu.\\n\\n## 6. Treatment\\nMost individuals recover from the influenza virus without the need for antiviral medication. However, antiviral drugs like Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Baloxavir can help reduce the severity if administered promptly after symptom onset. Home care strategies are recommended, including rest, hydration, and using over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to alleviate symptoms.\\n\\n## 7. Prevention\\nAnnual vaccinations are the primary and most effective means of preventing the flu. Different vaccines are available depending on age and health status. Alongside vaccination, good hygiene practices—such as regular handwashing, wearing masks in crowded settings, and refraining from close contact with sick individuals—play crucial roles in prevention efforts.\\n\\n## 8. Complications\\nWhile many healthy individuals recover from the flu without complications, it can lead to severe health issues, particularly for vulnerable populations, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic health conditions. During the 2023-2024 flu season, an estimated 28,000 deaths were attributed to influenza in the U.S.\\n\\n## 9. Seasonality\\nFlu season typically unfolds in fall and winter, peaking between December and February. The impact of the flu during these seasons can vary significantly from year to year based on influenza virus strain circulation and public health measures taken.\\n\\n## 10. Education Resources\\nExtensive resources for understanding, preventing, and treating the flu are provided by organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Mayo Clinic. These resources include guidance on vaccination, hygiene practices, and recognizing flu symptoms to encourage timely treatment.\\n\\nThese insights illustrate the key aspects of Influenza (Flu), emphasizing its symptoms, causes, prevention methods, treatment options, and the ongoing impact on public health.
